23,"Calder created a tribute to photographer Man Ray for a suite of prints, Hommage à Man Ray, initiated by the artist's last assistant. Calder's Hommage was one of only three submitted, and the edition was never published. With its odd assortment of images, this tribute to the eighty-four-year-old Man Ray reads like a private joke between two friends. Calder fondly recalled his early days in Paris when he hung out with ""quite a gang,"" which included Man Ray and Kiki, the ""Queen of Montparnasse."" The two had many other mutual friends, including Marcel Duchamp and Mary Reynolds."
46,"Marsden Hartley was born in Maine to English emigrant parents whose early death left him to be raised by a succession of relatives, all relatively impoverished. From this unlikely and emotionally wounding upbringing, Hartley became one of America’s great modern artists, a pioneer of abstract painting. Perhaps because his childhood was so terrible, Hartley always seemed to be looking for an “artistic” home, passing through many distinct phases in his art before ending his career with a return to Maine. Restlessly ambitious and determined to make an imprint on American culture, Hartley was also a writer and a not-inconsiderable poet. He was hindered by his self-consciousness, and this lends his verse—as it did his art—a mannered tone that could be didactic or hectoring."
58,"Today Harry Truman stands higher in the Democratic affections than he did when he left office on January 20, 1953, reported Time in its cover story prior to the 1956 Democratic convention in Chicago. The magazine, like scores of political pundits, predicted that the presence of former President Truman, then seventy-two, would be the highlight and catalyst of the convention, even more than the respected but lackluster repeat presidential nominee, Adlai Stevenson. In stark contrast, ""Democrats have come to look on Truman as a character, sometimes amusing, always indomitable, certainly admirable, almost always loveable."" Equally noteworthy was the anticipation of electronic gadgetry to enhance what was being billed as the grandest of all presidential conventions; particular attention was focused on improved air conditioning and live television coverage, as Chaliapin graphically forecast in this cover portrait."
60,"Ella Fitzgerald entered a Harlem talent contest in the mid-1930s, intending to do a dance. On stage, however, her legs froze, and in desperation she launched into song. Her fallback alternative proved good enough to win the contest, and so began a singing career that would make Fitzgerald the ""First Lady of Song."" Blessed with a voice capable of seamlessly spanning three octaves, Fitzgerald soon perfected her remarkable gifts for vocal improvisation, known as ""scat"" singing. Her ""songbook"" recordings of American standards, made from 1956 to 1964, are the definitive tributes to Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, and others. Fitzgerald's respectful understanding of a composer's intentions made these songwriters some of her most ardent fans. ""I never knew how good our songs were,"" lyricist Ira Gershwin once said, ""until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them."""
219,"Born Los Angeles, California  Singer-dancer Liza Minnelli was born into entertainment royalty: her mother was Judy Garland, and her father was Oscar-winning director Vincente Minnelli. Liza made her film debut as a toddler in her father’s In the Good Old Summertime (1949), which starred her mother.  Launching her own Broadway career in 1965, she received a Tony Award for her performance in John Kander and Fred Ebb’s Flora the Red Menace. Her greatest success came onscreen, however, portraying nightclub singer Sally Bowles in Bob Fosse’s 1972 movie version of the musical Cabaret. This movie showcased her strengths as a singer-dancer-actress, and her Best Actress Academy Award was among the film’s eight Oscars.  That same year, the scintillating Minnelli-Fosse-Ebb team collaborated on a high-energy television special, Liza with a “Z,” which won the Emmy for Outstanding Single Program—Variety and Popular Music."
319,"In 1897 Theodore Roosevelt was named assistant secretary of the navy just as the crisis with Spain over its colonial territories, especially Cuba, boiled over. Roosevelt had advocated war with Spain, and with the outbreak of hostilities he suited action to word by resigning from the Navy and organizing a volunteer cavalry unit dubbed the “Rough Riders.” Roosevelt regarded war as the ultimate test of a man’s—and the nation’s—mettle, and he was eager for the fight. His charge up Kettle Hill in the face of enemy fire not only tested his valor but made him a national figure. Two weeks after the Rough Riders disbanded in 1898, Roosevelt was the Republican Party’s candidate for governor of New York."
356,"Seth Boyden ranks among the great and versatile inventors of his day. His keen aptitude for mechanical engineering yielded a series of significant breakthroughs that led to improved production methods in several of the nation's burgeoning industries. Boyden's successes included perfecting a process for making varnished or ""patent"" leather; revolutionizing the American iron industry by developing a method for creating malleable cast iron; and improving the design of steam locomotives and stationary steam engines with his invention of a cutoff valve for regulating steam consumption. An early practitioner of the daguerreian process, Boyden also designed a unique camera for his own use."
409,"Published in 1850, Bayard Taylor's Eldorado, or Adventures in the Path of Empire provided a lively eyewitness account of California during the first year of the gold rush. Taylor wrote eloquently about the dramatic social and political changes then occurring in California-an area that the United States had recently acquired in the aftermath of the Mexican War. Taylor traveled to California in 1849 under the auspices of Horace Greeley's New York Tribune. Greeley hoped that he might provide a series of short sketches for publication, but Taylor found so much to write about during his four months in California that he decided to publish a book as well. To readers who wondered about the West's impact on newcomers from the East, Taylor wrote, ""A man, on coming to California, could no more expect to retain his old nature unchanged, than he could retain in his lungs the air he had inhaled on the Atlantic shore."""
493,"Before he came to the United States in 1839, the Swedish-born engineer and inventor John Ericsson revolutionized navigation with his development of the screw propeller. He achieved fame during the Civil War when he designed the ironclad warship Monitor, the federal response to the threat of the Confederate ironclad Virginia (the refitted USS Merrimack).  Ericsson, posing with a model of his ""tin can on a raft,"" always worked alone and had previously perfected engines for many purposes, including fire engines and a steam locomotive. He later developed the forerunner of the modern naval destroyer."
550,"Raised in Chicago, Kenneth Rexroth moved to San Francisco in his late twenties and became a crucial voice in that city’s burgeoning literary scene. He was master of ceremonies at the reading at which Allen Ginsberg debuted ""Howl"" and was a defense witness in the subsequent obscenity trial. Rexroth was loosely associated with Louis Zukofsky’s ""objectivist"" movement, and in California he combined his plain sense of words with a perception of nature that was inflected by Asian poetry and philosophy. Rexroth, along with poets like Robert Bly and Gary Snyder, helped bring foreign influences—especially Asian and Scandinavian poetry—into American writing. The Asian influence in Rexroth’s poems is evident in such lines as ""At the edge of the meadow. / Snows of a thousand winters / Melt in the sun of one summer."" These adaptations helped rejuvenate the romantic tradition in American poetry."
587,"A Mdewakanton Dakota chief, Little Crow played a pivotal role in diplomatic interactions between the eastern Dakota tribes and U.S. authorities during the 1850s and early 1860s. While he opposed the government's proposed acculturation program, Little Crow and others agreed in 1851 to a treaty that ceded almost all of the tribe's traditional landholdings in Minnesota. Tensions grew worse after they settled on a nearby reservation. Despite Little Crow's concern about militarily opposing the American settlers in the region, warfare broke out in the summer of 1862. Little Crow led successful attacks on an army fort and several settlements, but he and his followers were ultimately defeated six weeks later when President Abraham Lincoln directed reinforcements to quell the violence. Later that winter, thirty-eight Dakota were executed in a mass hanging for their involvement in this conflict. Little Crow was killed the following summer in a skirmish with a local farmer.  "
604,"One of the archetypal heroic figures of twentieth-century film, John Wayne conveyed a decisive, solitary, reverent screen persona that reflected traditional American values. Wayne's collaboration with director John Ford led to such classics as Stagecoach, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, and The Quiet Man. During World War II, Wayne starred in several morale-boosting movies, including Flying Tigers and Back to Bataan. He finally won an Oscar for his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn in True Grit (1969), as he is depicted here. About his long-lived popularity he said, ""I play John Wayne in every part regardless of the character, and I've been doing okay, haven't I?"""
664,"Milton tried to capture an instant, and reduce it to an abstract form that still carried his original response, Sally Michel wrote of her artist husband, Milton Avery. Her powerful, spontaneous portrait of him suggests a similar adherence to seizing upon and quickly completing a fresh idea. The use of soft pencil hatchings causes the background to recede, propelling the inked head forward in an assertive and energetic portrayal.  The Averys shared a marriage and a life immersed in art. Although Michel assumed the principal burdens of breadwinner, parent, and household manager, she and Milton drew and painted together regularly. ""Everything in my paintings that isn't a cow is usually Sally,"" Milton Avery once commented, suggesting not only his subject matter of family and domestic environment but also the central role that Michel played in her husband's art.  "
685,"A writer of popular novels and political satire, John Pendleton Kennedy served intermittently in Congress in the 1830s and 1840s before gaining national prominence in 1852 with his appointment as secretary of the navy by President Millard Fillmore. He remained in this post for just eight months, but during his brief tenure, Kennedy launched two important initiatives. He helped to organize Commodore Matthew Perry's initial expedition to Japan, and he dispatched a naval search party (headed by Elisha Kent Kane) in the hope of finding explorer Sir John Franklin and members of his expedition, who had disappeared while attempting to locate the Northwest Passage in 1845. "
714,"His admirers called him ""Gallant Harry,"" and his impetuous charm made him quite possibly the most beloved politician of his generation. But the real legacy of Kentucky's Henry Clay was his unstinting devotion, in the House of Representatives and later in the Senate, to maintaining a strong American union. In the early 1830s, as southern states threatened to nullify federal authority over a tariff bill that would have hurt plantation economies, Clay set aside his own preference for the new law to orchestrate a compromise. In 1850, with the North and South on the verge of armed conflict over the extension of slavery into the new western territories, Clay again stepped in with proposals that, temporarily at least, satisfied both sections. This last act of his career earned him the title of Great Pacificator.  "
724,"A pioneering figure in twentieth-century American music, Aaron Copland first rooted his work in jazz during the 1920s to showcase its divergence from European traditions. By the thirties, he used the flourishing mass media of radio and movies to create a large music-loving audience with film scores for Of Mice and Men and The Heiress, for which he won an Academy Award in 1949. Copland also composed scores for such ballets as Agnes de Mille's Billy the Kid and Martha Graham's Appalachian Spring, winning a Pulitzer Prize in 1944 for the latter. His symphonic compositions include A Lincoln Portrait and Fanfare for the Common Man."
764,"In 1909, the young stage actress Mary Pickford was having difficulty finding work in the New York theater, and although she considered it a professional step down to do so, she decided to investigate acting jobs with silent filmmaker D.W. Griffith. Griffith told her, ""You're too little and too fat"" but hired her anyway, and so began the rise of the silent screen's first major female star. Playing the exquisitely frail but spunky heroine in one melodrama after another, Pickford ultimately found herself hailed as ""America's Sweetheart."" By 1916 she was earning ten thousand dollars a week, and for many years after, she remained one of the movie industry's top box-office draws. The Pickford mystique took a sudden spike upward in 1920 when she married fellow screen idol Douglas Fairbanks. Together they became Hollywood's reigning royal couple. "
810,"Born Niles, Ohio     Many of the artists of the miniature revival at the turn of the century were women. Emily Drayton Taylor had studied painting in Paris and in Philadelphia before she began her career as a miniaturist in the early 1890s, after having three children. She was a great promoter of the art, and through her growing reputation, she was invited to Washington to make a pair of miniature portraits of President and Mrs. McKinley in the spring of 1899. This portrait, a slightly larger version of the likeness at the White House, descended in the artist’s family."
840,"Paul Colin and Le Tumulte Noir    The jazz age had taken hold in Paris and with it, le tumulte noir, an intense fascination with black culture. African sculpture had inspired such artists as Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso; African American ragtime and jazz stimulated avant-garde composers; dancers were captivated by the Cakewalk, the Black Bottom, and the Charleston. Many people perceived in non-Western art forms a ""pure"" and intuitive creative impulse, in contrast to the overrefined artifice of white European culture. African American expatriates fleeing segregation at home were welcomed.   In 1927 Paul Colin published his portfolio Le Tumulte Noir, featuring forty-five lithographs with pochoir, or stenciled, color, in an edition of 500. Colin's dynamic images were inspired by cubism and art deco modernism. Several lithographs directly evoke Baker's slim form, costumes, and energetic dancing. Others feature jazz bands, prominent white music-hall entertainers depicted as black, or amusing images of the French attempting new dances.    Le Tumulte Noir is not without racist overtones drawn from imagery prominent in American and European popular culture. Nonetheless, it does not just celebrate the ""primitive""; its tone is more admiring than condescending. "
875,"Jacob Lawrence achieved recognition during his lifetime previously unparalleled by an African American artist. This critical attention began early in his career. In 1941, at age twenty-four, he exhibited a series of sixty paintings, The Migration of the Negro, at the prestigious Downtown Gallery in New York. Visually chronicling the historic movement of African Americans from the South to the North between the two world wars, these paintings attracted wide notice and helped solidify Lawrence's reputation for creating multi-picture narratives about individuals and episodes in African American history. Other noteworthy series from this period highlighted such figures as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and John Brown. To the end of his career, Lawrence remained committed to an aesthetic of bold colors and flat forms and to a subject matter that was sensitive to the varied experiences of African Americans."
925,"This work replicates an unusual profile portrait of Thomas Jefferson that Gilbert Stuart painted in Washington, D.C., in 1805, at the beginning of Jefferson's second presidential term. The neoclassical composition ""in the medallion form"" was suggested by Jefferson, who later wrote that Stuart's portrait (now owned by Harvard University) was ""deemed the best which has been taken of me."" King, a Washington painter, made the copy for Jefferson's family, who preferred this neoclassical profile over Stuart's three-quarter view of Jefferson, which was painted at the same sittings. "
941,"  In 1851 engraver Thomas B. Welch traveled to Boston to create a portrait print that would faithfully reproduce the Athenaeum's 1796 painting of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart. Welch examined the original portrait but ultimately succeeded in producing his Washington print (issued in 1852) by working from three Southworth & Hawes daguerreotypes of the painting and utilizing the daguerreians' ""new apparatus for enlarging and tracing upon transparent paper, a copy of the exact size of his intended picture."" One of three surviving Southworth & Hawes whole plates of the Athenaeum portrait, this laterally reversed daguerreotype may have been among those that Welch employed."
1096,"Thirty-seventh President, 1969-74    For Richard Nixon, 1971 was indisputably a watershed year. To combat escalating inflation, he instituted wage and price controls; and to curb the national deficit, his administration devalued the dollar. Nixon also took bold new steps to diffuse the Cold War, withdrawing American forces in Vietnam, conducting arms-limitation talks with the Soviet Union, and opening a diplomatic dialogue with Communist China for the first time in twenty-five years.   In recognition of these accomplishments, Time designated Nixon its 1971 Man of the Year. Glaubach used recent news headlines trumpeting recent presidential actions to emphasize the magazine's rationale.    Time cover for January 3, 1972"
1125,"South Carolina's John C. Calhoun was a formidable presence in American politics for nearly four decades. In that time, he served twice as vice president and sat in two cabinets. It was during his later years in the Senate, however, that he had his greatest impact as a champion of southern interests and formulator of a sectional dogma of states' rights. But even as he defended the South against attempts to curb slavery and argued for the right of states to reject federal policies, he sensed that he was fighting a losing battle. His dying words in 1850 were ""The South, the poor South.""   One of five known versions of the likeness that the artist, George P. A. Healy, made from sittings with Calhoun in 1844, this portrait originally belonged to Calhoun himself."
1185,"At the height of the counterculture revolution of the sixties, 1967 was celebrated as the ""Summer of Love,"" with San Francisco serving as the epicenter of music, psychedelic drugs, and free love. Photographer Irving Penn was interested in documenting this phenomenon and was assigned by Look magazine to photograph two of the leading rock bands of the era-Janis Joplin with Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Jerry Garcia with the Grateful Dead. Joplin was described as ""the most staggering leading woman in rock,"" while Garcia-the lead guitarist and principal songwriter for the Grateful Dead-was best known for his extended guitar improvisations. Joplin died of a drug overdose in 1970, while Garcia and the Dead conducted an ""endless tour"" until his death in 1995."
1252,"Born near Easton, Maryland    Frederick Douglass was one of the most influential African Americans in the nineteenth century. In the 1840s and 1850s this ex-slave who escaped bondage best articulated the evils of slavery and the need to fulfill the American promise of equality. His skill as an orator and impressive bearing made him one of the most popular abolitionist spokespersons. Douglass' growing frustration-following passage of the Fugitive Slave Act-led him to advocate resistance to the law and even, with his support of John Brown, violence, forcing him to briefly flee the country. Douglass returned to America with the coming of the Civil War, his hopes revived."
1484,"Forty-first President, 1989-91    As this 1990 Man of the Year cover image by photographer Greg Heisler was meant to indicate, its subject, George Bush, had won his plural ""Men of the Year"" designation for two disparate reasons-one positive and the other negative. On the plus side, as Time pointed out, he had clearly proven himself a master of foreign policy, and in the wake of his skillful orchestration of the ultimately successful multinational coalition opposing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, he had earned much admiration both at home and abroad. But in contrast to his decisiveness in the international arena, his domestic policies were, in Time's estimation, ""hollow at the center"" and reflected no serious agenda.    Predictably, the Bush administration was not pleased with this story, nor did it appreciate Heisler's two-faced portrait. Consequently, both Time and Heisler found their access to the White House temporarily curtailed.    Time cover, January 7, 1991"
1500,"The Commodore, as he was dubbed for his domination of waterborne transportation, Cornelius Vanderbilt created one of the first great fortunes-and business dynasties-in American history. He began in the rough-and-tumble world of the New York port and by 1829 had parlayed several small shipping ventures into a stake in the lucrative Hudson River trade. He branched out to dominate the New England trade and seaborne travel to San Francisco. He next moved into railroads, eventually gaining control of the industry from New York to western Canada. Vanderbilt was a ruthless monopolist, driving out his competitors through rate wars, political muscle, and hostile takeovers. But in organizing America's fragmented transportation system, he facilitated national expansion and created the infrastructure on which an expanding economy could build.  "
1571,"Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal measures of the 1930s drew bitter criticism from both left and right. Among the most listened-to attackers was a spellbinding Catholic priest, Father Charles Coughlin, whose radio sermonizing had won him a nationwide following. Initially Coughlin endorsed the New Deal's efforts to fight the Depression. But soon his florid tirades were accusing Roosevelt of failing the common man, and in 1934 he launched his Union for Social Justice, calling for permanent redistribution of the nation's wealth. Taken alone, Coughlin's radicalism might not have caused concern. The ""radio priest,"" however, had like-minded allies, also with large followings, and many moderates viewed their extremism as a serious threat to the country's stability.  By the late 1930s, Coughlin was on to other issues, and his defense of fascism and anti-Semitism made him now seem to many an irresponsible hate-monger.  "
1628,"Making clothing for soldiers was a common practice for women in both the North and South. Here, Volck depicts the process of making homespun apparel in a family setting, with a grandmother spinning flax into thread, a mother at the loom weaving the thread into cloth, and a daughter sewing the cloth into a military garment."
1712,"Unrivaled in his day as a Democratic Party operative, James Farley ""built the Roosevelt bandwagon"" and provided much of the political muscle behind Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. After helping Roosevelt win New York's governorship in 1928, he went on to manage FDR's hugely successful 1930 reelection campaign. Farley reprised his role as campaign manager when Roosevelt embarked on his quest for the presidency and was instrumental in securing FDR's nomination at the 1932 Democratic National Convention. Farley himself won election that year as the party's national chairman-a post he held until 1940. Rewarded with the office of postmaster general after Roosevelt's victory in November, Farley used his position to dispense patronage jobs to countless Roosevelt loyalists. He again served as campaign manager when FDR won reelection in 1936, but broke with Roosevelt in 1940 over the president's decision to seek an unprecedented third term."
1720,"This mug shot of the criminal William Miner comes from the archive of the Pinkerton Detective Agency. On the photograph's reverse, it lists Miner's occupation as ""train robber,"" his complexion as ""swarthy,"" and notes that he has a ""dancing girl tattooed on his left arm."" Despite being jailed on numerous occasions, he always returned to his criminal habits upon being released or escaping from prison. Miner began his career as a prospector and a Pony Express rider but was jailed in 1866 for holding up a stagecoach. When he was not in prison, Miner spent much of the next forty-seven years engaged in some type of robbery scheme. Although he worked principally in the West, this photograph was created in Georgia after his arrest for holding up a Southern Express train. In spite of his wide reputation for prison breaks, Miner escaped several months later. He was captured shortly thereafter and died in prison in 1913. "
1730,"Arguably the most brilliant African American scientist of his generation, Ernest Everett Just graduated magna cum laude from Dartmouth College in 1907 and earned his doctorate in zoology from the University of Chicago in 1916. After joining the faculty at Howard University, Just played a substantial role in upgrading the quality of training offered at its medical school. His greatest distinction, however, was attained as a marine researcher; his studies in cellular physiology and experimental embryology-conducted principally at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts-yielded a host of groundbreaking discoveries and theories. Because of entrenched racial prejudice, Just was never able to fully join the American scientific community, despite the obvious significance of his research. But European scientists welcomed him; supported by funding from various foundations, he spent much of his later career conducting research abroad."
1763,"In his portrait of Zelda Fitzgerald, Harrison Fisher accentuates the angular features that made F. Scott Fitzgerald's bride a stunning beauty. Despite outrageous behavior, Zelda was widely praised for her spontaneity, intellect, and dignity. Anxious to compete with her husband's success, Zelda pursued numerous creative avenues of her own-ballet, painting, drawing, and writing. None of these efforts met with the recognition she craved. Fisher's profile also reflects the tension that he perceived in her. Energetic, almost chaotic lines layered over her torso convey her passion-and perhaps her delicate mental state. Later, when institutionalized for a nervous breakdown, she would write of her husband, ""I realize more completely than ever, how much I live in you and how sweet and good and kind you are to such a dependent appendage."" The Fitzgeralds kept Fisher's portraits with them all their lives.  "
1807,"By the mid-nineteenth century, single-sheet broadside cartoons played an important role in electioneering. Some of these broadsheets were printed in quantities from 50,000 to 100,000 and distributed to party headquarters or sold from newspaper offices. The venerable Currier & Ives Lithography Company, the most prolific print publishers of the period, issued numerous cartoons in the election of 1860, satirizing all factions. Progressive Democracy features the dilemma of a divided Democratic Party. With Stephen Douglas and running mate Hershel V. Johnson pulling the ""platform"" one way while southerners John C. Breckinridge and Joseph Lane, driven by James Buchanan, strain in the other direction, Republican candidates Abraham Lincoln and Hannibal Hamlin anticipate the ""smash up"" of the Democratic Party."
1808,"Richard Wright devoted much of his literary career to investigating the toll that racial prejudice exerted on society. The son of an illiterate sharecropper, Wright eventually settled in New York City, where he became the most respected African American writer of his day. His breakthrough novel-Native Son-was published in 1940. Centered on the murder of a white girl by the ""brute Negro"" Bigger Thomas, Native Son sold well but also aroused great controversy for its uncompromising portrayal of racism in America. Despite his literary success, Wright was unwilling to tolerate the discrimination he experienced, and in 1947 he moved permanently to Paris. This image was taken the year before by Fred Stein, a well-respected photographer who had fled his native Germany at the outbreak of World War II.  "
1873,"Doris Humphrey began her dancing career as a member of the Denishawn company, founded by modern-dance pioneers Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn. By the late 1920s, she was exploring her own abstract version of modern dance, and in 1928 she left Denishawn to establish a studio and performing ensemble with Charles Weidman. Premised on the principle of ""moving from the inside out,"" her innovations in technique and choreography were slow to win acceptance. But Humphrey persisted, and by 1940 she had greatly expanded the vocabulary of her chosen art. Today she is considered a main force in the evolution of American modern dance.  This photograph was taken in about 1923, when Humphrey was still performing with Denishawn. In it, she wears a wig of simulated seaweed that was part of her costume in the company's ballet The Spirit of the Sea."
1948,"As a young insurance cashier, Henry Baldwin Hyde perceived many shortcomings in his industry. He saw the need to promote life insurance as a moral good-as the ""protector of widows and orphans""-to counter attacks by the clergy that it denied faith in divine protection. In 1859 Hyde launched Equitable Life Assurance, gaining the endorsement of such well-known ministers as Henry Ward Beecher. He gave policyholders the benefit of the doubt in disputes, and was the first to offer policies to women. Equitable was soon a leading insurance company and helped make life insurance an essential part of American life.  "
1954,"By 1901, when he drew this self-portrait, Everett Shinn was an acclaimed illustrator and pastel artist. The drawing conveys both the charm of Shinn's early pastels and the lack of definition that worried some critics. But Shinn's mastery of the technique is evident. Instead of the bright impressionist palette popular at the time, he uses muted tonalities with a touch of vivid color. Shinn's downturned face is more theatrical than melancholy. Recognizing that a degree of dramatic posturing was expected of an artist, he here assumes the role of brooding romantic, and he inscribed the drawing to the celebrated actress Julia Marlowe. In 1908 Shinn sent a sketch of himself posing for publicity photos to fellow Ashcan artist John Sloan. ""Great fun. being an artist. with temperament,"" he joked.  "
1996,"Born Miami, Florida  Pictured by David Burnett for a Time magazine cover story shortly after becoming the nation’s first female attorney general, Janet Reno would go on to enjoy one of the longest tenures in this position, serving until 2001. Reno earned the public’s admiration with her straightforward approach: ""I think it’s important that we look not with labels, not with shorthand terms, not with partisan politics but with good, hard-nosed common sense."" Reno faced significant challenges while in office, such as the 1993 Waco siege, which ended violently. As attorney general, Reno witnessed the emergence of domestic and international terrorism, including the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City (1995) by Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols and the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993. She later attracted controversy for declining to release documents related to the impeachment of President Clinton in 1998. "
2062,"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked. With this, the first line of Howl (1955), Allen Ginsberg launched the postwar counterculture’s revolt against the American consensus. Ginsberg sparked the self-styled Beat movement that took the double meaning of its name from a sense of exhaustion with postwar American triumphalism and a despairing commitment to rebel against it with a new cultural politics rooted in individual identity. Howl was also Ginsberg’s coming-out as a poet, as he put aside all his self-consciousness and allowed his unmediated voice to pour out. With Howl ""Allen finally accepted his homosexuality and stopped trying to become ‘straight’"" in all meanings of the word, noted his biographer, Bill Morgan. In a photograph by William S. Burroughs displayed in this grouping, Ginsberg presents himself as a nice, buttoned-down Jewish boy who was recently a student at Columbia. His appearance gives no indication of the internal turmoil that would result in America’s greatest long poem since Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. "
2096,"Arnold Newman took this portrait of Duchamp at ""The First Papers of Surrealism,"" a group exhibition that Duchamp co-organized with fellow artist André Breton. For the exhibition, Duchamp had acquired sixteen miles of string, only one mile of which he used to create a cobweb effect throughout the venue, obstructing the viewing experience and disrupting conventional ideas for the installation of artwork. Newman's closely cropped photograph, which shows Duchamp looking through a barricade of threads, evokes Duchamp's Three Standard Stoppages, a work that recorded the random falling of bits of string and was also featured in this exhibition. On another level, the haphazardly arranged string recalls the cracks in The Large Glass (1915-23), which was broken in transit after being exhibited at the Brooklyn Museum. Newman's photograph suggests the inseparability of the artist and his oeuvre. "
2104,"Handsome, social, and intellectually vivacious, F. Scott Fitzgerald embodied the spirit of the Roaring Twenties. He staked his claim as the voice of his generation with his first novel, This Side of Paradise (1920), and later with The Great Gatsby (1925). In 1926, Fitzgerald was invited to create a movie script in Hollywood. Popular society portraitist Harrison Fisher captures Fitzgerald's self-assurance and boyish good looks as he arrived in California, detailing his features and hair with rich conté crayon. ""The mouth,"" wrote Ernest Hemingway about Fitzgerald, ""worried you until you knew him and then it worried you more."" Fitzgerald's stay in Hollywood would be marred by drunken antics that tarnished his reputation. After eight weeks, his screenplay was rejected. Retaliating, the Fitzgeralds piled their hotel furniture in the middle of the room, leaving their unpaid bills at the top."
2147,"Davidson sculpted Franklin D. Roosevelt at the White House. Davidson noted, ""He was rolled in, seated in a wheelchair and he greeted us with a broad, cheerful smile."" He wrote later that Roosevelt ""won me completely with his charm, his beautiful voice and his freedom from constraint. He had unshakeable faith in man. . . . Nobody before had worried about the artist, but in Roosevelt's tremendous relief program, the artist too was included, and the influence of the WPA projects was tremendous."" Davidson, a strong supporter of Roosevelt, offered casts similar to this one as a fundraiser for the Young Democrats during the 1936 election.  "
2168,"A West Point graduate and veteran of the Mexican War, George Pickett led the courageous but disastrous charge that bears his name at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, on July 3, 1863. Confederate General James Longstreet remembered how Pickett looked as he led his gallant charge, ""his jaunty cap raked well over his right ear, and his long auburn locks nicely dressed, hanging almost to his shoulders. He seemed rather a holiday soldier than a general at the head of a column which was about to make one of the grandest and most desperate assaults recorded in the annals of war."""
2215,"When Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001, he could point with pride to a balanced budget and a reported surplus of $559 billion. Moreover, his approval rating was 66 percent, the highest of any departing president since World War II. Yet at the very start of his administration, it is doubtful that even Clinton, optimist that he was, could have predicted such success. Instead, he was predicting dire economic times for the nation in the near future. ""If we don't reform our economic policies,"" he warned, ""ten years from now, we won't even recognize the country."" Clinton was talking up the risks in preparation for his major speech before Congress calling for roughly $150 billion in new or increased taxes over four years. In this context, Time ran this cover with the title ""Uncle Bill Wants You: What Clinton's Plan to Raise Taxes Will Do to Your Wallet.""    Time cover, February 22, 1993"
2386,"This portrait of Jesse James was marketed to audiences not long after the famous outlaw was killed in 1882 at the age of thirty-four. Given James's elusiveness, his wife provided confirmation that it was he who was pictured in this photograph. James's life of violence began when he became a member of a Confederate guerrilla group as a teenager-along with his older brother Frank-in part to avenge an assault on his family by Union troops during the Civil War. After the war, James failed to return to the life of a law-abiding citizen and instead began robbing banks and trains in Missouri. A Kansas City newspaper editor who supported James's Confederate sympathies transformed his criminal activities into sensationalized fiction and made James appear more as a forgivable Robin Hood figure than the unrepentant bandit that he was.   "
2433,"The versatile composer Philip Glass has written operas, symphonies, chamber music, theatrical and film scores, and other choral and instrumental compositions. Although he trained at Julliard and privately with Nadia Boulanger in Paris, Glass rejected traditional compositional styles after exposure to Indian sitar and other nonwestern music. Using repetitive, cyclical rhythmic patterns that evolve slowly, Glass first caught the attention of the avant-garde art world. Eventually he received both critical and popular recognition; his work is acclaimed at movie theaters and rock clubs as well as Carnegie Hall and the Metropolitan Opera. Glass's friendship with Chuck Close dates to the 1960s. Both of them, Close has explained, worked with the relationship of the part to the whole within a firm set of restrictions. The artist has made many portraits of his friend; finally, in 2005, Glass composed a ""musical portrait"" of Close."
2528,"In this poster for the film Affair in Trinidad, the artist focused on Columbia Pictures's carefully constructed image for its leading lady, Rita Hayworth. Born Margarita Carmen Cansino, the daughter and onetime partner of a Spanish dancer, Hayworth was transformed by the early 1940s into a redheaded film goddess. In this Italian movie poster, the sensuality and vitality of her brilliantly colored figure is in marked contrast to the monochromatic depiction of costar Glenn Ford, with his grim gesture of violence. Because of the lack of interaction between them, each portrayal suggests an iconic pose rather than a specific scene. Veteran poster artist Anselmo Ballester cared more about capturing a mood than conveying specific details of the film, and in fact the images come from a previous Hayworth-Ford film, Gilda. ""I must suggest,"" Ballester once noted; ""the rest is up to the movie."""
2546,"Appointed in 1865 as the U.S. Army's commanding general for the territories west of the Mississippi River, William T. Sherman applied in his confrontation with Native Americans the same scorched-earth tactics he had utilized against the Confederates during the Civil War. During the four years he held this post, Sherman was principally responsible for protecting those who were constructing the transcontinental railroad. Toward this end he established a network of military outposts throughout the West and negotiated peace treaties with several Native tribes. Yet when some groups refused to accept a new life on reservations, Sherman was ruthless in subjugating them. Remarking that all Native Americans not on reservations ""are hostile and will remain so until killed off,"" he led the effort to decimate the buffalo population, a vital food source for many. In this group photograph from 1865, Sherman is seated at the center with his arms and legs crossed."
2594,"It was President Ulysses S. Grant's bad fortune to have been at the seat of power during the Panic of 1873, a worldwide event that triggered one of this country's worst economic downturns-a five-year depression. Fortunately, however, Thomas Nast, the era's most satirical caricaturist, was Grant's close friend. Nast supported the administration in times of crisis, as revealed in this cartoon, which appeared on the cover of the October 18, 1873, issue of Harper's Weekly. Grant is depicted as the gallant chief of police helping the maiden Columbia out of the fallen rubble that is labeled Wall Street. Although the worst of the depression was still to come, Nast targeted the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange, which closed its doors the last ten days of September. The Grant administration took the immediate stopgap measure of releasing fifty million dollars into the stricken economy. "
2672,"In April 1870, in Savannah, Georgia, two former Confederate generals and West Point classmates, Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnston (left), met for the first time since the war ended; five years earlier, they had surrendered the South’s last two effective armies. Both sixty-three, they aspired to be productive in civilian life as best as circumstances would allow. Lee was the president of Washington College in Lexington, Virginia, and Johnston was in the insurance business in Savannah. The noticeable shine on Lee’s shoes, in contrast to Johnston’s, was characteristic of that model officer, who had graduated from the U.S. Military Academy forty-one years earlier without a single demerit. They posed for photographer David J. Ryan of Savannah, probably in his downtown studio. "
2737,"The Apollo 11 mission in July 1969—NASA’s first attempt to land men on the moon—was a unifying moment for America in a decade rife with social discord, racial violence, and antiwar protests. Time covered every facet of the nine-day mission, as noted by one correspondent, with “a deep, visceral understanding that here was history, and perhaps the act that may ultimately guarantee man’s survival.” Looking back, that was perhaps an overstatement, but there was no denying that it was a “once-in-a-lifetime emotion” for many who watched on television as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the lunar surface for the first time. For this special issue, Time selected one of its favorite artists, Louis Glanzman, who had made twenty-nine covers for the magazine. His painting depicting Armstrong on the moon carrying the American flag and a camera has been one of Time’s most popular covers ever.  Neil Armstrong  1930–2012     En julio de 1969, la misión Apolo 11, primer intento de la NASA de colocar un ser humano sobre la faz de la luna, fue un momento unificador para el pueblo estadounidense en una década plagada de desacuerdos sociales, violencia racial y protestas antibélicas. Time cubrió cada faceta de los nueve días que duró la misión con “el entendimiento profundo y visceral de que se estaba haciendo historia y quizá el gesto que a la postre garantizaría la supervivencia de la humanidad”, según comentó un corresponsal. Mirando atrás, quizá fue decir demasiado, pero es innegable que muchos sintieron “una emoción única en la vida” al ver por televisión a Neil Armstrong y Buzz Aldrin caminar sobre la superficie lunar por primera vez. Para esta edición especial, Time seleccionó a uno de sus artistas favoritos, Louis Glanzman, quien ya había hecho veintinueve portadas. Su pintura de Armstrong en la luna sosteniendo la bandera de Estados Unidos y una cámara ha sido una de las portadas más populares en la historia de la revista.     Louis S. Glanzman (1922–2013)  Acrílico y caseína sobre masonita, 1969  Portada de Time, 25 de julio de 1969"
2788,"Born Brazil, Indiana    A highly effective but controversial labor organizer, Jimmy Hoffa rose through the ranks of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) to become its all-powerful president (1957-71). Working aggressively to expand teamster membership and secure higher wages for the rank and file, Hoffa built the IBT into the world's largest labor union and successfully negotiated the trucking industry's first nationwide contract (1964). Hoffa's strong-arm tactics, reputed underworld alliances, and questionable management practices made him the target of numerous investigations, but it was not until 1964 that he was convicted on charges of jury-tampering, fraud, and conspiracy stemming from his handling of the union's pension fund. After the commutation of his sentence and his release from federal prison in 1971, Hoffa embarked on a campaign to regain control of the IBT. Immersed in that power struggle, he vanished under mysterious circumstances in 1975, the probable victim of foul play."
2818,"“All quiet along the Potomac”    Mathew Brady’s cameraman, Thomas Le Mere, thought that a standing pose of the president would be popular. Lincoln wondered if it could be accomplished in one shot, and this is the successful result. It was taken on April 17, 1863, an interregnum after an eventful winter that saw the implementation of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1 and a further reshuffling of the command of the Army of the Potomac following the disastrous Union defeat at Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. Joseph Hooker replaced the hapless Ambrose Burnside, refitted the army, and prepared to move south. Striking Lee at Chancellorsville on May 1, Hooker obtained a strong initial advantage but was undone by Lee and “Stonewall” Jackson’s audacious flank attack on the Union right, just as the sun set on the battle’s first day. Demoralized, Hooker withdrew, allowing Lee to invade the North for the second time.   "
2823,"Born into a prosperous Iowa farm family (his grandfather was Theodore Roosevelt's ""country life commissioner""; his father, Harding's secretary of agriculture), Wallace was a leader in the fight against low farm prices in the 1920s. As Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of agriculture during the Great Depression, Wallace developed the controversial policy of limiting production, paying farmers to destroy crops and slaughter livestock. Wallace's policies failed to raise prices as high as they had been, but they achieved some success and became a model for later secretaries of agriculture. He became Roosevelt's running mate in 1940 but was dropped from the ticket in 1944.  "
2995,"Henry and Mary Ann Meade   As the daguerreotype was gradually eclipsed by a succession of other photographic processes in the latter part of the 1850s, the firm of Meade Brothers adapted its offerings to accommodate new technologies and changing tastes. Ivorytypes and paper-print photographs were introduced, and in 1861 the gallery’s staff included an ""artist in oil, etc.,"" who could embellish images by hand-coloring them. The work of such a colorist is reflected in this pair of portraits of Henry and Mary Ann Meade."
3007,"High on the agenda of the New Deal's response to the Depression were measures designed to strengthen industrial unions. Among the most visible labor organizers taking advantage of those measures was John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers. The burly Lewis was as fiercely combative as he looked. In 1936, when the American Federation of Labor was cool to his push to organize workers according to industry rather than craft, he went ahead with the idea anyway, forming what became the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Over the next several years, he led the CIO's bitter, but successful, struggles to unionize the nation's steel, rubber, and auto industries.  This portrait, done for Time magazine, marked Lewis's success in 1933 in unionizing 95 percent of the nation's coal industry. Time called it the ""biggest"" worker victory in the ""history of U.S. labor.""  "
3080,"Born Boston, Massachusetts  Mary Livermore’s career during the Civil War exemplified the emergence of women as both a moral and practical force for reform, a force that altered the political landscape of the late nineteenth century. Livermore, who was strongly religious, plunged into charitable and public works to aid wounded and disadvantaged soldiers. Starting as a volunteer, she became a key figure in the movement to create a national “sanitary commission” to look after these soldiers. Following the war, Livermore transferred her energies to the fight for women’s rights. She founded a suffrage newspaper and served as president of the American Woman Suffrage Association (1875–78)."
3081,"   Born Winsted, Connecticut  Ralph Nader is the pioneer of the modern American consumer movement, fulfilling the role in the late twentieth century that had been taken by muckraking journalists such as Upton Sinclair at the turn of the century. As a law student at Harvard in the late 1950s, Nader began to write about safety as a business issue, focusing especially on the automobile industry. He came to widespread public attention with a withering, and sometimes overstated, critique of American automobiles, Unsafe at Any Speed (1965). The resulting furor, including lawsuits and attempts by the car companies to discredit Nader, led to the first imposition of safety standards for cars. In the aftermath, consumer issues became a staple among political progressives in the 1960s. Nader attracted hundreds of young people—who became known as Nader’s Raiders—to work with him on consumer and public health issues . By the 1970s Nader moved into politics, becoming the Green Party’s perennial candidate."
3101,"On August 9, 1974, Gerald Ford became the first president who had neither campaigned for or been elected to either the presidency or the vice presidency. Ford later wrote that his friendship with Richard Nixon had placed him in ""an impossible situation. I couldn't abandon Nixon. . . . Nor could I get too close to him, because . . . I'd risk being sucked into the whirlpool myself."" That, however, is just what happened when, a month after becoming president, Ford granted Nixon a ""full, free, and absolute pardon."" Highly unpopular, Ford's pardon was a major reason for his loss to Jimmy Carter in 1976. In his memoirs, Ford defended his decision: ""I simply was not convinced that the country wanted to see an ex-president behind bars."" In 2001 he was given the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award for his pardon of Nixon. "
3129,"Born Salem, Illinois     The contentious presidential election of 1900 reflected in this campaign poster pitted William Jennings Bryan, running as a populist and Democrat, against Republican incumbent William McKinley, who had beaten Bryan in 1896. The poster used slogans immediately recognizable to the voters. ""No crown of thorns""/""no cross of gold"" referred to Bryan's electrifying 1896 convention speech, which called for abolishing the gold standard and inflating the currency to relieve debtors, especially farmers. Bryan's three unsuccessful runs for the presidency (1896, 1900, and 1908)-in which he campaigned for such changes as the national regulation of corporations, tariff reductions, a national income tax, the direct election of senators, and an end to ""imperialism""-were both a cause and a result of a major realignment in American politics that, with one exception, gave Republicans the presidency and national majorities until the early 1930s. "
3165,"Born Trenton, New Jersey  Following in the footsteps of his father, Norman Schwarzkopf set his sights on a military career after graduating from West Point in 1956. A heroic incident during his second tour of duty in Vietnam in 1970 “firmly cemented his reputation as an officer who would risk his life for the soldiers under his command.” Schwarzkopf, on hands and knees, courageously led a group of survivors from his battalion who were trapped on a minefield to safety. Yet Schwarzkopf did not come to national attention until the 1991 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. As commander-in-chief of U.S. forces in Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, he masterfully planned the strategy and oversaw the preparations for a sustained air attack, followed by what would be a one‑hundred‑hour ground war and total rout of the Iraqi army."
3197,"Around 1930 William Edmondson experienced a life-changing vision. Declaring that ""Jesus has planted the seed of carving in me,"" the former janitor began transforming discarded blocks of limestone into highly original tombstones, human figures, and ""critters"" that he believed were divinely inspired. With no formal training, Edmondson achieved remarkable effects, using a railroad spike and a worn hammer to chisel each stone. Religious belief often influenced Edmondson's choice of subjects, but memory, nature, popular culture, and African American traditions also informed his art. Unknown outside of his Nashville neighborhood, Edmondson's sculptures came to the attention of the art world when photographer Louise Dahl-Wolfe recorded images of the artist and his work. Impressed by these photographs, Museum of Modern Art director Alfred Barr arranged a solo exhibition of Edmondson's work in 1937-the first time MoMA had so honored an African American artist."
3228,"Horatio Gates, a professional soldier in the British army, fought in the French and Indian War and rose to the rank of major before peace put an end to his advancement. In 1772 he sold his commission and purchased a farm in Virginia. Upon the outbreak of war with England, Congress promptly appointed him a brigadier general in the Continental army.   Gates was awarded a congressional gold medal for his ""brave and successful efforts"" to bring about the surrender of General John Burgoyne and his whole army at Saratoga in September 1777. But his reputation was ruined by his ignominious defeat at Camden in 1780. ""Was there ever so precipitate a flight,"" jested Alexander Hamilton about Gates's hasty retreat. ""It does admirable credit to the activity of a man at his time of life.""  "
3240,"Born in Maryland, Roger Taney was a lawyer, politician, and the fifth chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. During the Court’s hearing of Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) he described African Americans “as so far inferior, that they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect.” The Court, in a seven-to-two majority, rejected the slave Dred Scott’s appeal for freedom because blacks, free or slave, were “not included, and were not intended to be included, under the word ‘citizens’ in the Constitution.” The Court also rejected Congress’ right to restrict the expansion of slavery into new territories. This made slavery constitutional by supporting the southern opinion that slaves were property and thus beyond the control of Congress. It also nullified the Missouri Compromise, polarized opinions in the North and South, divided the Democratic Party, and radicalized the Republican Party. "
3271,"This poster, designed by an Office of War Information art director, David Stone Martin, was one of several inspirational posters aimed at the black community. At the outbreak of World War II, the armed services practiced rigid discrimination against African Americans that included a stubborn reluctance to acknowledge black capabilities. When Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, navy messman Dorie Miller was serving on the USS West Virginia. Before abandoning ship, he braved enemy fire to carry a wounded officer to safety and, although not trained for combat, manned an antiaircraft gun, possibly downing at least one enemy plane. He eventually received a Navy Cross, but only after intense pressure by the black press. The poster's heroic overtones and quote gain extra poignancy in hindsight: Miller, later a messman on the USS Liscombe Bay, was killed when the aircraft carrier sank in the Pacific in November 1943."
3288,"Appearing in nearly two hundred films over a fifty-year Hollywood career, John Wayne rarely played characters whose values didn’t mirror his own. At six feet four inches with broad shoulders, Wayne embodied the rugged individualism synonymous with the ""Old West."" Though he starred in combat films and romances, he was most famous as the stoic tough guy in westerns directed by John Ford and Howard Hawks. Often speaking in a slow drawl with squinted eyes, his characters subscribed to a well-defined moral code and an insisted-upon sense of duty. Wayne was also an outspoken political conservative whose ardent anticommunism and unflagging support of the Vietnam War drew criticism at times. Yet audiences invariably returned to see his next movie. A diehard patriot, he saw himself nevertheless as a rebel, remarking once, ""Mine is a rebellion against the monotony of life."" This photograph pictures Wayne two years before his 1939 breakout hit, Stagecoach."
3321,"Born Willoughby, Lincolnshire, England  John Smith led the group that in 1607 founded Jamestown, North America’s first British settlement. With the backing of a group of British investors known as the Virginia Company of London, Smith served as the first governor of this colonial outpost. Most famous for having been supposedly rescued by Pocahontas when threatened by Native inhabitants, Smith made a larger contribution to the settlement of North America in his exploration of the region. While he traveled to map the Chesapeake Bay, the colony, its inhabitants crippled by disease, struggled to survive. By 1610 it was largely abandoned. Smith had been severely burned when his gunpowder bag exploded a year earlier, and he decided to depart for England. He returned in 1614 to explore New England but spent the remainder of his life in England, where he wrote extensively about the New World, focusing especially on its economic potential. "
3334,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
3463,"Self-Portrait #3  This painting and one similar to it in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City are the most fully realized of Elaine’s self-portraits of the 1940s. Its coloring is similar to Willem’s work from around the same time, but it fully asserts Elaine’s own presence as an artist and a portraitist. She has presented herself in what may be a studio setting, but she is holding a sketchbook rather than painting materials. Clad in trousers, turtleneck, and smock, she confronts the viewer directly, the hallmark of a self-portrait. The painting includes a number of still-life objects that reflect her years of intense tutorials with Willem; he compelled her to look at objects and the spaces between them to develop her sense of pictorial organization. As she recalled: ""Everything was a matter of tension between objects or edges and space.""    Esta pintura y otra parecida que se encuentra en el Museo Metropolitano de Arte de Nueva York son los autorretratos más logrados de Elaine en la década de 1940. Su colorido se asemeja al de las obras de Willem en esa época, pero deja bien establecida la personalidad propia de Elaine como artista y retratista. Aquí la vemos en lo que podría ser su taller, pero en vez de sus instrumentos de pintura tiene en las manos un cuaderno de bocetos. Vestida con pantalones, suéter de cuello alto y blusón, mira directamente al observador, un detalle distintivo de los autorretratos. Se observan varios objetos típicos de los bodegones; esto refleja sus años de intensa práctica con Willem, quien insistía en que analizara los objetos y los espacios entre ellos para desarrollar un sentido de organización pictórica. Recordaba que: “Todo era cuestión de la tensión entre los objetos o bordes y el espacio”."
3588,"Born Los Angeles, California   Anna May Wong was the first Chinese American actress to become a major box-office attraction. After scoring a success as the exotic Mongol slave in The Thief of Bagdad (1924), Wong was immediately pegged as Hollywood’s ""oriental siren."" Relegated to minor parts in a series of movies featuring unsympathetic portrayals of Asian characters, she left Hollywood for Europe in 1928, where she received leading film and stage roles. She returned to the United States in 1930 to star in the Broadway play On the Spot, during which time Edward Steichen created this portrait. Although Wong appeared regularly on screen throughout the 1930s, the U.S. film industry never gave her the opportunity to move beyond stereotypical roles. As a consequence, Wong often found herself in the unenviable position of performing in films that perpetuated racial stereotypes or not working at all."
3598,"After Frederick Douglass escaped from slavery, he invented the concept of African American public individuality, investing it with a fierce public dignity evident in this image. Self-educated, Douglass became a powerful orator and writer advocating racial pride and social change through direct, even violent political action. The women’s rights leader Elizabeth Cady Stanton referred to his bearing this way: ""he stood there like an African prince, conscious of his dignity and power, grand in his physical proportions, majestic in his wrath."" His example provided a foundation for the emergence of the concept of cool itself from African American culture in the 1940s."
3614,"Photographer Paul Haviland and Mexican-born artist Marius de Zayas both gravitated to Alfred Stieglitz's galleries at 291 Fifth Avenue around 1908. Within the Stieglitz circle, they would play important roles in the emerging avant-garde, including their co-authorship of the first studies of modernist aesthetics in America. In this highly theatrical, back-to-the-audience depiction, de Zayas shows Haviland with his camera, intent on the stopwatch held in one hand while gripping the shutter bulb in the other. The dense, mysterious atmosphere of this innovative charcoal portrait was reminiscent of the soft-focus, pictorial photography that Stieglitz also showed in his galleries. Despite the humor of the strained pose, de Zayas's drawing, with its enigmatic figure, suggests a psychological insight into Haviland's character more closely related to fine art than to cartooning."
3651,"Combining superb musicality, physical ability, and dramatic sense, prima ballerina Suzanne Farrell won acclaim as one of the twentieth century's great dancers and inspired legendary choreographer George Balanchine to create many of his most significant works. Only sixteen when she joined the corps of Balanchine's New York City Ballet in 1961, Farrell danced her first lead within a year. Soon Balanchine was choreographing roles expressly for her, and in 1965 she became one of the youngest dancers in the history of the company to be elevated to the rank of principal dancer. The initial phase of Farrell and Balanchine's creative partnership flourished until 1969, when a dispute caused the ballerina to leave the City Ballet. When Farrell rejoined the company in 1975, she once again became both Balanchine's muse and his expressive instrument. Together they challenged and delighted audiences until Farrell's retirement from the stage in 1988."
3719,"When the United States went to war against Spain in 1898, Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt resigned to organize a volunteer unit known as the Rough Riders. On July 1, 1898, which he later called ""the great day of my life,"" he led his troops in a charge up Kettle Hill, one of the largest battles of the war. Cheering crowds and swarms of reporters welcomed Roosevelt back to the United States. The talk was that he would be the next governor of New York, if not president of United States."
3729,"Journalist and revolutionary John Reed lived a picaresque life, which helped create the modern image of the romantic activist. Cultivating his writing skills at Harvard, Reed plunged into the bohemian world of pre-war New York after college. In 1912 he was named an editor of The Masses, an important muckraking magazine, where he became radicalized while covering the labor movement and the Mexican Revolution. Sent to Russia to cover the revolution, he became a fervent supporter of the Soviet cause, speaking at meetings and helping to organize the party's propaganda efforts. His Ten Days That Shook the World (1919) remains the best eyewitness report on the Russian Revolution, despite its partisanship.   In this image, Reed belies his radical beliefs and tempestuous personal life-his ""open marriage"" to journalist Louise Bryant caused a scandal-to adopt a relaxed pose that makes him look like a safe, sober, and prosperous banker. "
3757,"In spite of vocal prodding from abolitionists, President Lincoln steadfastly refused to make the abolition of slavery a northern goal in the early stages of the Civil War, lest it alienate slaveholding border states that remained loyal to the Union. By mid-1862, however, Lincoln’s concern for enhancing the moral weight of the United States in the eyes of the world convinced him that it was time to act. In September 1862, he announced the Emancipation Proclamation, which would take effect on January 1, 1863, and declared all slaves free in those regions of the South still in rebellion.   This lithograph is based on a painting by Francis Bicknell Carpenter and recreates the cabinet meeting Lincoln held on July 22, 1862, at which he read the first draft of his proclamation."
3775,"At the beginning of his administration, Millard Fillmore bestowed his presidential blessing on the Compromise of 1850-Senator Henry Clay's proposal to unite the North and the slaveholding South. The ensuing harmony, however, was short-lived. Among the compromise's concessions to the South was the new Fugitive Slave Law, which facilitated the capture of runaway slaves, and Fillmore was determined to enforce it. As northern abolitionists sought to undermine enforcement, tempers on both sides of the issue flared again. The sectional bitterness made a future rupture over slavery all but certain.  Fillmore's portrait by an unidentified artist dates to about the time he retired from the House of Representatives in the early 1840s. In the years following, he devoted himself to reconciling the growing differences among fellow Whigs in his native New York State."
3821,"The second president of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, Brigham Young orchestrated the resettlement of the Mormon community to Utah. Fearing further persecution following the murder of founder Joseph Smith in 1844 by an anti-Mormon mob in Illinois, Young and other church leaders decided to start anew in the West. By 1847 the first two thousand settlers had migrated to Salt Lake City. Appointed the territorial governor of Utah by President Millard Fillmore in 1850, Young led the effort to transform the ""Promised Valley"" into a thriving agricultural community. Relations with the federal government later soured-in part because of the public outcry over the practice of plural marriages-yet Young continued to oversee Mormonism's expansion in the West. By the time of his death, nearly one hundred thousand followers had settled in Salt Lake City and surrounding towns in the Great Basin. "
3895,"Of all the War Hawks, John C. Calhoun of South Carolina most eloquently put forward the argument that a ""second struggle for our liberty"" was not only necessary, but positive for the country. As head of the Foreign Relations Committee, Calhoun believed that another war was needed to reinvigorate the country and create a new generation of patriots. He wrote, ""The war will be a favorite one with the country. Much honor awaits those who may distinguish themselves."" Mismanagement by the War Department throughout the war frustrated Calhoun, and as secretary of war, he would later overhaul the department, making vast improvements for the future of the military. Calhoun is the only vice president to serve under different presidents—John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson. He resigned under Jackson to return to the Senate, where he became a champion of states’ rights and nullification. "
3991,"When actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks wed in 1919, movie fans cheered the union of two of Hollywood's most beloved stars. Pickford was admired as the epitome of feminine innocence, and her childlike charm in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) and Daddy Long Legs (1919) earned her the affectionate title of ""America's Sweetheart."" Fairbanks represented the ultimate in swashbuckling romance, and his bravura performances in films such as The Mark of Zorro (1920) and The Thief of Bagdad (1924) made him a top box-office draw throughout the silent era. Although Pickford and Fairbanks co-starred in only one film, The Taming of the Shrew (1929), they formed an important off-screen partnership. In 1919, in an effort to control the dissemination and marketing of their movies, the couple joined director D.W. Griffith and actor Charlie Chaplin in founding the independent film distribution company United Artists."
3997,"Known now as the founder of Pinkerton’s Detective Agency, Allan Pinkerton was one of the Civil War’s most controversial figures. Before the war, he had worked as a detective in Chicago and founded his own agency, which largely focused on crimes against the railroads; it was Pinkerton who warned of a possible presidential assassination plot as Abraham Lincoln traveled to Washington for his inauguration. As the armies organized in 1861, General George McClellan brought Pinkerton in as an intelligence officer; he knew the operative from his prewar position as a railroad executive. Pinkerton rose with McClellan and became responsible for military intelligence in the eastern theater. But Pinkerton’s intelligence was completely unreliable, as he vastly overestimated the Union army’s opposition. At Antietam, McClellan hesitated to both attack and then pursue Robert E. Lee’s army because Pinkerton had convinced him that the Confederates outnumbered the Union. In fact, McClellan held a superiority of about three to one.  Pinkerton used the name E. A. Allen on several covert missions, which is why that name appears on this mount."
4165,"April of 1973 was a crucial month in the unraveling of the convoluted Watergate scandal, which eventually shook Richard Nixon's presidency to its foundation and led to his resignation. This cover by caricaturist Jack Davis offered as good a summation of what happened that month as any single picture could. Beginning with James McCord, who had been part of the Nixon reelection campaign's scheme to wiretap the Democrats' Watergate offices in 1972, many of the finger-pointing individuals seen here had said things to the press and in legal proceedings that implicated all of them in a host of unlawful actions related to the wiretapping. The men surrounding Nixon in Time's cover commentary on this extraordinary news saga are (clockwise from upper left): James McCord, Jeb Magruder, H. R. Haldeman, John Dean, John Mitchell, and former Secretary of Commerce Maurice Stans. Ultimately, all were convicted of wrongdoing in Watergate.    Time cover, April 30, 1973"
4214,"President Lyndon Johnson signs the Civil Rights Bill at the White House  After criticizing President John F. Kennedy for failing to advance civil rights legislation, King was elated when Kennedy addressed the nation on June 11, 1963, and pledged to seek passage of a civil rights bill that would provide ""equality of treatment"" to every American. Sent to the House on June 19, the bill soon became stalled in committee, where it languished until President Kennedy’s assassination on November 22. Declaring that prompt passage of Kennedy’s civil rights bill would be the most fitting way to honor the late president, Lyndon Johnson successfully pressured Congress to bring it to a vote. The bill cleared the House on February 10, 1964, and reached the Senate floor on March 30, where it was blocked by a filibuster until June 10. When the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was finally signed into law by President Johnson on July 2, King (second row, center) attended the ceremony."
4242,"James Dean was the first American teenager realistically captured by Hollywood, and he stamped adolescence with a half-squinting look of tormented yearning and tentative tenderness. Beautiful and bisexual, Dean remains ""the poet of what it’s like to be young, lost, or alone,"" one biographer wrote. In his short, meteoric career, he combined small-town midwestern innocence (Indiana childhood, East of Eden [1955]) with mythic Americana (as Jett Rink in Giant [1956]), and urban bohemia (still photos in New York City) with the automotive escapism of suburban high school kids (Rebel Without a Cause [1955]). His appeal came from being ""able to expose the emotion on-screen that he couldn’t in real life,"" one close friend said. Dean’s persona is still often invoked by young American actors, and his life is now myth, as if captured by the formulaic phrase, ""live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse."" As one writer claimed about Dean’s cool, ""he made adolescent defiance heroic."""
4265,"Born Seattle, Washington  A pioneer of performance art, Rose Louise Lee and her younger sister, June, grew up dancing and singing on the vaudeville stage. When Rose was fifteen, their act was accidentally booked into a burlesque hall. As she watched the strippers, she realized that even though they had no real talent, they were getting all the money. They were stars. It was a eureka moment, and Rose joined the burlesque circuit.  As “Gypsy Rose Lee” she was acknowledged as “the queen of the strippers.” Her act was “seven minutes of pure art” rather than the bumps and grinds of burlesque. Popular writer H. L. Mencken coined the phrase “ecdysiast” to describe her high-class striptease.   Her 1957 memoir, Gypsy, became a musical hit on stage and screen. When asked if it trivialized her work, she said, “I don’t care what they say about me as long as my name is up there.”"
4428,"“A new birth of freedom”    The abolition of slavery did not automatically give civil rights to African Americans. Except for some radicals, the issue of slavery was viewed largely by how it affected whites, not blacks. The assumption of black racial inferiority was almost universal, and Lincoln initially shared the racism of the day.  But as Lincoln sharpened his thinking about the Union, he was forced by his own logic—a logic founded in the universal rights of man—to recognize that race could not be used to define citizenship. Even if blacks were racially inferior—a proposition that Lincoln came to doubt—that did not exclude them from the protections of the law and the advantages of full citizenship.  Frederick Douglass made the first official visit by an African American to the White House, and when asked how Lincoln had treated him, Douglass said, “Like a gentleman.”   "
4430,"This Currier & Ives cartoon makes light of the capture of President Jefferson Davis by Union cavalry near Irwinsville, Georgia, on May 10, 1865. The major Confederate armies had surrendered weeks before, but Davis still held hopes of escaping capture and fleeing the country with his wife and children. His depiction in petticoats alludes to the purported disguise he was wearing when apprehended. Mrs. Davis, however, explained that she had thrown a waterproof cloak or wrapper over the shoulders of her ailing husband to counter the dew and early morning chill."
4639,"Born Sun Prairie, Wisconsin     Georgia O’Keeffe first traveled to New Mexico in 1929 and moved there permanently in 1949, following the death of her husband, Alfred Stieglitz. Although she achieved early success as a modernist painter living in the East, the landscape of the desert Southwest gave O’Keeffe her greatest inspiration. She painted familiar subjects such as flowers, adobe buildings, and objects found on walks around her remote home. Yet she did so in a unique way, often transforming common items into colorful abstractions with an emphasis on form and line. By the late 1940s O’Keeffe was one of the best-known and original artists in America. An admirer once commented that she was like “the unflickering flame of a candle, steady, serene, softly brilliant,” adding that she “faces the world unconcernedly ‘as is.’”"
4880,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    Arturo Toscanini said that Marian Anderson had a voice that came along ""once in a hundred years."" When one of Anderson's teachers first heard her sing, the magnitude of her talent moved him to tears. Because she was black, however, her initial prospects as a concert singer in this country were sharply limited, and her early professional triumphs took place mostly in Europe. The magnitude of her musical gifts ultimately won her recognition in the United States as well. Despite that acclaim, in 1939 the Daughters of the American Revolution banned her from performing at its Constitution Hall. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt ultimately intervened and facilitated Anderson's Easter Sunday outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial-an event witnessed by 75,000 and broadcast to a radio audience of millions. The affair generated great sympathy for Anderson and became a defining moment in America's civil rights movement.  "
4880,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
4967,"Poet E. E. Cummings, who famously avoided uppercase letters in his writings, declared that ""poetry and every other art was and is and forever will be strictly and distinctly a question of individuality."" Believing that poetry was visual as well as verbal, Cummings defied rules of punctuation, capitalization, and arrangement of words on the page in his poems of the 1920s and 1930s, offering a new literary experience for Americans. For some, he demonstrated the rich possibilities for self-expression; others he left feeling uncomfortable and annoyed. In either case, his radicalism made an indelible mark on twentieth-century letters and, in the words of one critic, extended ""the capabilities of poetry"" well beyond its traditional limits. As this self-portrait indicates, Cummings was also a competent painter. After serving in World War I, he studied painting in Paris and exhibited his work in New York.  "
4992,"Born in England, Juliana Westray made her dramatic debut in Boston in 1797. In 1803 she joined the Philadelphia company of actor, director, and theater manager William Burke Wood, whom she married in 1804. A preeminent actress for the next twenty years, she was best known for her performances in Macbeth, Sir Walter Scott’s Heart of Midlothian, and Richard Sheridan’s comedy of manners, School for Scandal.              This portrait shows Juliana Wood in front of a stage, indicated by a curtain and ropes. David Edwin’s engraving of the portrait was published in the March 1811 issue of The Mirror of Taste, and Dramatic Censor, which featured theater reviews, the texts of plays, and essays on the history of the stage. The text called the portrait “a striking resemblance of a lady whose public talents and private virtues have raised her to a very high rank in public estimation.”"
5008,"William Faulkner was at work in the late 1920s on his third novel, Sartoris, when it struck him that his ""own little postage stamp of native soil"" in Mississippi contained so much material to write about that he could ""never . . . exhaust it."" With that in mind, he began inventing the fictional universe of Yoknapatawpha County, which would be the vehicle in nearly all his works for examining the South's slaveholding past and its dark, tragic grip on the present. Over the next decade or so, he produced some of the finest pieces in American fiction, including The Sound and the Fury, Light in August, and Absalom, Absalom! In 1949 he won the Nobel Prize for Literature."
5054,"From 1881, when the Rhode Island legislature appointed Congressman Nelson Aldrich to fill a vacant Senate seat, through his reelections in 1886, 1892, 1898, and 1904, Aldrich became one of the most powerful figures in the upper house. Aldrich's ascendancy marked a period when the Republican Party transformed itself, focusing on making America an industrial world power rather than on its original goals of emancipation and civil rights. Although Aldrich worked closely in the Senate with business leaders, he appears to have been honest, sincerely believing that the general welfare of America was best served by government and business working together. Nonetheless, Aldrich was a wealthy man who became wealthier in the Senate; it was all appropriately symbolized by the wedding of his daughter to John D. Rockefeller Jr.   The Swedish artist Anders Zorn, who made numerous visits to America after 1893, noted that Aldrich was one of his more difficult sitters because of the expression of his eyes. "
5112,"Benjamin F. Butler of Massachusetts was a savvy lawyer and politician with high aspirations for military command during the Civil War. He was also one of the personalities whom Volck targeted for some of his severest satire. In the spring of 1861, Butler was commanding the Eighth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, one of the first regiments to respond to President Lincoln’s call for state militia. Without authorization, he assumed command of Union militia near Baltimore and occupied the city. Butler would continue to be a maverick and overstep his orders as the war progressed. In this satire, Volck depicts Butler as drunk, bungling, and in need of assistance from his soldiers to mount his horse."
5168,"Born Clarksburg, West Virginia    When future Confederate general Stonewall Jackson sat for this likeness in 1855, his emergence as one of the South’s most brilliant military tacticians lay six years away. A West Point graduate, Jackson had served with distinction in the Mexican American War, earning more citations for valor than any other American officer. He joined Virginia Military Institute as a professor of artillery tactics and natural philosophy in 1851, and later commanded the corps of VMI cadets that guarded the gallows at John Brown’s execution. Jackson had this daguerreotype made as a memento for his aunt and uncle while visiting them in the summer of 1855."
5214,"Born Bordentown, New Jersey    For nearly thirty years, Richard Watson Gilder served as editor of The Century magazine. Under his leadership the magazine became one of the late nineteenth century's most esteemed and widely read literary publications. In the process Gilder became an important arbiter of American letters, and he is often regarded as a primary force in popularizing the new social realism of writers such as William Dean Howells. He also nurtured a post-Civil War literary awakening in the South by being among the first to publish the works of several southern writers, including Joel Chandler Harris and George Washington Cable. Gilder's portrait was the work of his friend Cecilia Beaux, who was perhaps the most successful female portraitist of her day. One critic declared the likeness a ""great and sweet"" characterization of ""the poet, the thinker, the man of lofty visions."""
5271,"During the 1930s and 1940s, Ben Shahn's murals and portraits on behalf of liberal and progressive causes earned him national recognition. Shahn worked for President Franklin Roosevelt's Farm Security Administration in the 1930s, convinced that New Deal reforms were necessary to get the country out of the Great Depression. He also favored the president's strong support of organized labor and the passage of the landmark National Labor Relations Act in 1935. In 1944 Shahn worked the Political Action Committee of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, creating posters that supported Roosevelt's strongly contested campaign for a fourth term. The CIO PAC was one of FDR's most powerful and wealthy supporters in this election.  Shahn's poster presented a warm and sympathetic image of FDR, a father-like figure looming above his supporters: laborers wearing AFL and CIO buttons, soldiers, African Americans; a child representing the future."
5379,"In 1915, when director Cecil B. De Mille lured renowned opera star Geraldine Farrar to Hollywood, he hoped that her aura of high culture would add to the prestige of motion pictures. The beloved diva had no need of further accolades. Already popular in Europe, she was the reigning soprano at the Metropolitan Opera at the time, often paired with Enrico Caruso. Her sound recordings reached a mass audience. But Farrar, who considered herself as much an actress as a singer, ultimately appeared in fourteen silent films. According to Agnes de Mille, she was one of the first great international stars to try the ""western [film] experiment."" In The Devil's Stone (1917), Farrar's character is a ""fishermaid"" who becomes a modern urban wife. Sven Brasch's Danish poster, however, exploits the emerald of the title to depict Farrar as the glamorous leading lady that audiences expected, with evening gloves, jeweled diadem, and gown."
5449,"In a tribute he wrote soon after Rico Lebrun's death, Leonard Baskin noted of his teacher, mentor, and friend, ""Nothing human was alien to Lebrun's vision."" That sustained passion for the human figure in Lebrun's art during an era dominated by abstract expressionism profoundly influenced Baskin. In this deeply felt posthumous portrait, Baskin captures the fine line between representation and suggestion. Connecting the profile to the background through slender threads of ink-possibly representing breath, speech, or aura-he creates the impression of a remembered face, suggesting the gulf between absence and presence, memory and reality. At Lebrun's death in 1964, Baskin felt very much alone. But at the time of this 1968 drawing, he was earning international acclaim as the art world began to rediscover what he and Lebrun had always known-the profound potential of the human figure."
5508,"From his childhood on, Richard B. Harrison wanted to be an actor. But after completing several years of study at a drama school, he found that opportunities for black actors in American theater were almost nonexistent, and for most of his career he alternated between giving lectures and readings and teaching elocution and drama. Harrison finally got his theatrical break in 1929, when he was offered the role of God in Green Pastures, a production with an all-black cast that was based on Old Testament stories. Opening on Broadway in 1930, the play proved an enormous hit, and one of its greatest strengths was Harrison's elegantly tempered interpretation of God. His performance, declared one critic, deserved a ""place among the classics."" In the wake of this stage triumph came many honors, including the NAACP's Spingarn Medal for distinguished achievement.  "
5538,"“The restless engine of his ambition”    Lincoln was continually underestimated by his opponents, and even his friends. Because he had not served long in national politics—only one term in the House of Representatives—he was seen as a nonentity; the smart money certainly did not consider him to be of presidential timber. Quietly ambitious, Lincoln launched himself as a major figure in the Republican Party, promoting northern unionism in his senatorial campaign against Democrat Stephen Douglas in 1858. Moreover, Lincoln created a focused campaign organization that won him the Republican presidential nomination. By 1860, with the national political parties splintered, Lincoln ran against three opponents, the most prominent of whom was Douglas. After a hard campaign, in which the South ratcheted up the secession rhetoric, Lincoln won with a plurality of the popular vote and an overwhelming Electoral College advantage. With “Black Republicanism” triumphant, South Carolina seceded from the Union on December 20.  "
5586,"It was F. Scott Fitzgerald who named the self-indulgent 1920s the Jazz Age, and his best-selling novel This Side of Paradise became one of the decade's first literary landmarks. But his most enduring achievement was The Great Gatsby (1925), which, in meticulously crafted prose, wove a modern morality tale set against a backdrop of luxury. Fitzgerald and his talented wife Zelda experienced-in New York, Paris, and Hollywood-some of the glamorous life he evoked. But struggling with financial disappointments, alcoholism, and Zelda's mental illness, Fitzgerald also probed the destructive underside of the era's bright illusions. When he met artist David Silvette in 1935, Fitzgerald was suffering from an emotional breakdown. He agreed to pose, however, and considered this a ""swell"" portrait. His career as chronicler of the dreams and disappointments of contemporary life was cut short by his death five years later.  "
5620,"Born Canton, China  One of the most influential architects to emerge in the decades following World War II, I. M. Pei is recognized throughout the world for his striking, high-modernist designs. Drawn to the United States to study architecture in 1935, Pei earned his undergraduate degree from MIT and later completed graduate work at Harvard. After first directing the architectural division of a large real-estate concern, Pei founded his own architecture firm in 1955, one year after becoming a U.S. citizen. As his reputation grew, important projects—such as the 1964 commission for the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library—came his way. Pei went on to create such iconic structures as the critically acclaimed East Wing of the National Gallery of Art (1978) and the distinctive glass pyramid that forms the entrance to the Louvre (1988). He has received many major awards, including the coveted Pritzker Prize (1983)."
5622,"During the 1940s, few in Hollywood could hope to match Ingrid Bergman's popularity at the box office. Already a star in her native Sweden when she came to the United States in 1939 to make her American film debut in Intermezzo, Bergman was embraced by moviegoers, who responded to her luminous, natural beauty and to the empathy and vulnerability she exuded on screen. Perhaps best remembered for her performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (1942), Bergman's initial string of film successes included Gaslight (for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1944), The Bells of St. Mary's (1945), and Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945) and Notorious (1946). Ostracized in 1950 when her much-publicized extramarital affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini produced a child, Bergman did not resume her American film career until 1956, when her performance in Anastasia earned her the Academy Award."
5632,"Born Colchester, England    Quaker reformer Benjamin Lay was a key figure in the emerging antislavery movement prior to the Revolutionary War. Having witnessed slavery's horrors while working as a merchant in Barbados, Lay dedicated himself to the abolitionist cause. He was forced, however, to leave this Caribbean island in 1731 in the wake of intensifying hostility by local slave owners. Settling in Philadelphia, he resumed his campaign, writing pamphlets and speaking out at Quaker meetings. His efforts ultimately compelled the Philadelphia Society of Friends in 1758 to pass a resolve expelling those members who owned slaves.  This portrait of the diminutive activist was commissioned by Benjamin Franklin, whose printing shop had published one of Lay's most stinging abolitionist tracts. Here, Lay stands before the cavelike dwelling in which he and his wife lived and holds a treatise ""on happiness"" by English Quaker philosopher Thomas Tryon."
5668,"The exuberant posters of Parisian nightlife that French artist Jules Chéret began producing in the 1860s helped launch an international poster craze in the late nineteenth century. Chéret was known for his brilliant colors-described by one critic as ""a hooray of reds, a hallelujah of yellows and a primal scream of blues""-but the effects of his 1893 poster of American dancer Loïe Fuller were actually inspired by her own performance. The former Mary Louise Fuller of Fullersburg, Illinois, was the sensation of Paris at the time. Against a black velvet background, she focused changing colored lights on her voluminous costumes of iridescent silk, creating a magical effect of swirling color and light. In this poster, the fiery colors, spiraled pose, and jagged contours enhance the sense of movement, and the laughing, turning figure seems momentarily suspended in time and space."
5737,"Whether playing on the big screen at theaters or on televisions at home, sagas of the great American West captivated Americans nationwide in the decade of the 1950s. For its cover of March 30, 1959, Time paid tribute to six of TV’s western heroes. Pictured in Chaliapin’s roundup are: (front, left to right) Hugh O’Brian, the star of ABC’s The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (1955–61); Dale Robertson, ""the left-handed gun"" in NBC’s Tales of Wells Fargo (1957–62); (back, left to right) James Arness, Dodge City’s consummate bachelor U.S. marshal, Matt Dillon, star of CBS’s long-running Gunsmoke (1955–75); Richard Boone, star of CBS’s Have Gun—Will Travel (1957–63); Ward Bond, starring on NBC’s Wagon Train (1957–60); and lastly James Garner, as professional gambler Bret Maverick in ABC’s comedy-western, Maverick (1957–62). Television has not seen such a cast of gun-toting Western good guys since."
5749,"Abraham Lincoln’s assassination caused confusion, widespread panic, and anger in the North as well as foreboding in the South, as it anticipated a violent reaction if it turned out that John Wilkes Booth (1838–1865) had been acting on orders from the Confederacy. Wholesale roundups of suspected conspirators and sympathizers occurred in the weeks after the assassination. Union authorities identified the conspirators fairly quickly, however. It is evidence of the ongoing nature of the investigation that this “Wanted” poster correctly identifies John Wilkes Booth as the conspiracy’s prime mover. It flanks him with two of the lesser actors in the plot. David E. Herold (c. 1842–1865)­—misspelled “Harold” here—who had failed to assist another conspirator, Lewis Powell, escaped from the city with Booth. Both men eluded pursuit until April 26, when Union troops cornered them in a Virginia farmhouse. Herold surrendered, but Booth resisted and was shot and killed. John Surratt (1844–1919) successfully escaped the country but was captured and returned to the United States in 1867. He was tried for his part in the conspiracy and freed after a mistrial."
5777,"Born Edgefield District, South Carolina     Confederate general James Longstreet was Robert E. Lee’s senior lieutenant and one of the most effective corps commanders on either side in the Civil War. Longstreet graduated from West Point, where his closest friend was Ulysses S. Grant; later he served as best man at Grant’s wedding. In 1868, three years after surrendering with Lee at Appomattox, Longstreet endorsed the Republican Party’s presidential candidate and his old friend Grant, making him the only senior Confederate officer to switch political allegiances and adopt the northern point of view, particularly concerning the equal rights of African Americans. Called the worst kind of scalawag by a former Confederate colleague, he was criticized, along with his war record, by unreconstructed southerners for the rest of his life. Longstreet defended himself in his memoirs, From Manassas to Appomattox, published in 1896."
5881,"Born Honolulu, Hawaii   During World War II, after the U.S. Army lifted its ban on Japanese Americans, Daniel Inouye joined the first all-Nisei volunteer unit, winning a Distinguished Service Cross, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart with cluster after losing his right arm. He later received a Medal of Honor. He returned to his native Hawaii to help lead a movement that brought political power to the region’s ethnic minorities. When Hawaii was admitted to the union in 1959, Inouye became the new state’s first congressman. He was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1962, and in 2010 he became the Senate’s senior member—third in the line of presidential succession and the highest-ranking public official of Asian descent in American history. Inouye gained national attention serving on the Senate Watergate Committee in 1974. In 1976 the Senate majority leader appointed him chairman of the Senate Committee on Intelligence, established to reform and monitor clandestine operations."
5912,"Born Dayton, Ohio  Regarded by Frederick Douglass as ""one of the sweetest songsters his race has produced,"" poet Paul Laurence Dunbar became the first African American author to be able to support himself solely through his writings. Although he wrote three novels and many short stories, it was his poetry, written in both standard English and African American dialect, that first caught the attention of a national audience and allowed him to leave his job as an elevator operator. Although many readers gravitated toward his dialect poems that presented a sunny vision of African American life, Dunbar also probed with great eloquence the harsh world of racial segregation and discrimination. His example inspired not only the next generation of African American writers, but also William McKnight Farrow, who like Dunbar grew up in Dayton before moving to Chicago to pursue a career as an artist."
5942,"Reviewing a recital by Marcia Van Dresser in 1920, a New York Times critic commented on the American mezzo-soprano's ""opulent beauty and aristocratic bearing."" The renowned illustrator and muralist Violet Oakley captured both in this monumental 1923 drawing. Oakley met Van Dresser in England at a concert arranged by a mutual friend, Lady Maude Warrender. The singer subsequently offered to perform at one of Oakley's gatherings, and the drawing was apparently started around that time. When Warrender invited both women to her home in Sussex, she wrote, ""Why not bring your sketch of Marcia and finish it here?"" More than mere friendship inspired the portrait, however. Oakley's dramatic profile pose of her subject echoes the powerful, elegant female figures of her allegorical murals. With her statuesque beauty and strength of character, Van Dresser embodied Oakley's feminine ideal.  "
5957,"Here, this is Stieglitz. Faith and Love, reads the translated French title of this satiric depiction of photographer Alfred Stieglitz. Published in 1915 as the cover of the avant-garde American journal 291, it was one of a series of witty ""machine portraits"" by French artist Francis Picabia, soon to become a leading figure in the developing Dada art movement in New York City. The journal's title, named after Stieglitz's 291 Gallery on Fifth Avenue, pays tribute to the photographer's role in promoting modern art. But the symbolic portrait suggests that he has lost his momentum: it portrays its subject as a limp and broken camera striving toward, but not reaching, the ""Ideal,"" with an automobile gearshift lodged in neutral and a hand brake engaged."
5961,"Convinced that a peaceful end to slavery was impossible, Frederick Douglass embraced the Civil War as a fight for emancipation and was dismayed when President Lincoln first chose to cast the conflict solely as a struggle to preserve the Union. In speeches and in print, Douglass called upon the president to wage a war for liberation and to enlist black troops in the cause, arguing that the North was fighting ""with only one hand"" by refusing to accept African American recruits. When Lincoln changed his strategy and issued the Emancipation Proclamation, Douglass was jubilant. He vigorously promoted black enlistment but briefly suspended these efforts in August 1863 out of concern over the unequal treatment of black soldiers. Although a meeting with Lincoln convinced him that conditions for black troops would improve, Douglass was bitterly disappointed when Secretary of War Edwin Stanton’s pledge to commission him as a Union army officer went unfulfilled."
6053,"Although Lee became an object of fascination in both South and North, he got off to a rough start as a general, botching a small campaign at the start of the war and then having a mixed performance in his first overall command during the Seven Days Battles. But Lee grew into the job, and by 1862 he had something of a mesmeric effect on Union commanders, including George McClellan (who consistently overestimated Lee’s forces to excuse his caution) and the hapless Ambrose Burnside. In his Memoirs, Grant noted the effect of Lee’s charisma on friend and foe alike, noting that it “was not an uncommon thing for my staff-officers to hear from Eastern officers, ‘Well, Grant has never met Bobby Lee yet.’” Grant respected Lee but refused to let the Confederate’s reputation dictate his strategy. Grant insisted that his officers “think what we are going to do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do.”  Robert E. Lee     Aunque Lee se volvió un favorito tanto en el Norte como en el Sur, al comienzo pasó por tiempos duros, al arruinar una pequeña campaña al comienzo de la guerra y después tuvo un desempeño irregular en su primer mando completo durante las Batallas de los Siete Días. Pero Lee mejoró en su trabajo y en 1862 tuvo un efecto hipnótico sobre los comandantes de la Unión, incluido George McClellan (quien constantemente sobrevaloraba a las fuerzas de Lee para excusar su cautela) y el desafortunado Ambrose Burnside. En sus Memorias, Grant observó el efecto del carisma de Lee tanto en amigos como en enemigos, y recalcó que ""no era raro que mi plantel de oficiales oyese que los oficiales del Este dijeran 'Bueno, es que Grant aún no conoce a Bobby Lee'"". Grant respetaba a Lee, pero se negaba a que la reputación del confederado dirigiera su estrategia. Grant insistía para que sus oficiales ""pensaran qué haremos, en vez de pensar qué hará Lee"".

6113,"Born Morganton, North Carolina    Sam Ervin's professed ambition was always just to be a country lawyer with an occasional term as a judge in his native North Carolina. Yet in 1954 he permitted himself to be appointed to the U.S. Senate, where he served for the next twenty years. Ervin's Senate career typified that of a southern Democrat: he was a states'-rights conservative (especially on civil rights), pro-defense, and a strict constructionist of the Constitution. It was his knowledge of constitutional law and reputation for integrity that vaulted this folksy figure to national prominence and fame as the chair of the Senate's committee investigating the Watergate affair. Ervin had the bipartisan support necessary to conduct the hearing, and his avuncular yet firm control of proceedings laid the groundwork for President Nixon's subsequent resignation."
6256,"There is a story that when Ulysses S. Grant traveled east in 1864 to take command of all the Union armies, the desk clerk at Washington’s Willard Hotel did not recognize him and assigned him to a mean, nondescript room. (When Grant identified himself, he was upgraded to a suite.) The anecdote points out that likenesses were not yet widely distributed, even after the advent of photography. It was possible for famous people to remain unidentified. But fame meant that one had one’s photograph taken, as Grant did in this image Gardner took after the western general arrived in Washington. Grant was coming off a string of successes in the West, including the successful siege of Vicksburg, which made him the inevitable choice for overall command. In Grant, Lincoln finally found a general who would consistently engage the enemy’s forces. Indicative of Grant’s stature, Lincoln bestowed on him the rare title of lieutenant general, a rank previously held only by George Washington."

Because she was black, however, Anderson's initial prospects as a concert singer in this country were sharply limited, and her early professional triumphs took place mostly in Europe.  Ultimately, her musical gifts also won her recognition in the United States.   In 1939 Anderson became the focus of a highly publicized racial incident, which began when the Daughters of the American Revolution blocked her appearance at its Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C. The affair generated great sympathy for Anderson and culminated with her concert at the Lincoln Memorial, which became a defining moment in America's civil rights movement."
6401,"Although unpublished as a poet until she was fifty-eight, Amy Clampitt wrote for much of her life, beginning at Grinnell College then moving, with aspirations to be a novelist, to New York City. Clampitt repeatedly reincarnated themes from her early years—surrounded by nature in a fairly religious town in Iowa—into her adult life as she spent time in rural Maine and in Europe. We see the intentional integration of her spirituality, politics, and experience of the world around her into her writing in which she, for instance, advocates against the war in Vietnam. Clampitt’s body of poetic work, which is considered part of the ""new formalist"" tradition, employs decorative language to vividly render scenes from all periods of her life. Her ebullient prose was in equal parts praised by her supporters and targeted by her detractors. "
6498,"Man Ray made this photograph most likely on assignment for the magazine Vanity Fair, which ran the image in a story about Stein and Jo Davidson in February 1923. "
6526,"Born Boston, Massachusetts    In the decade before the Civil War, Massachusetts senator Charles Sumner numbered among the most vehement critics of slavery in Congress. In fact, the harshness of his antislavery speeches led to one of the most dramatic events in Senate history-a physical attack on him in the Senate chamber by a southerner, which left him gravely injured. After the Civil War, Sumner became an ardent champion of the effort to ensure a full measure of rights for the South's newly freed slaves."
6561,"President Franklin Roosevelt was labeled an enigma by many of his closest advisers and cabinet members. After meetings with him, especially one-on-one sessions in the Oval Office, bureaucrats would often come away with the impression that the president had agreed with their position, only to discover later that his actions were quite the contrary. The graphic media creatively caricatured what many were describing as Roosevelt's sphinx-like nature, which could neither be fully understood nor penetrated. Here, editorial cartoonist Oscar Cesare depicts Roosevelt in 1937 as the Great Sphinx of ancient Egypt, rising amid the Capitol and Washington Monument while representatives of both political parties look on with anticipation and bewilderment."
6620,"In his 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan argued that despite the easing of Cold War tensions during the period known as détente, the Soviets had conducted a massive military buildup. Once elected, Reagan resisted pressure to negotiate with Soviet leaders, focusing instead on restoring America’s military strength. Moreover, Reagan never viewed arms agreements as a solution to Cold War tensions, asserting that nations were not hostile because they were armed, but armed because they were hostile. Believing that the Soviet Union’s economy could not sustain a protracted arms race with the United States, Reagan was determined to outspend the Soviets, increasing the defense budget each year of his first term by about 50 percent from the previous year. The Soviet Union, along with many Western allies of the United States, strenuously objected to these arms expenditures but later came to the negotiating table.    "
6675,"The Harlem Renaissance of the early twentieth century was a misnomer. Harlem had always been the capital of African America, with its own cultural and social traditions. What ""Renaissance"" actually connoted was whites’ discovery of African America and their grudging admission to allow the most talented blacks to cross the color line and gain a measure of acceptance, if not full social and political equality. Among poets, Langston Hughes was a trailblazer, not only for black writers but also for his ability to force his way into mainstream American literature. Although white intellectuals projected their racial fantasies and preconceptions onto African Americans, seeing them as a way of revitalizing a sterile culture by injecting a dose of the ""primitive,"" Hughes focused on a deep commitment to African American history, treating the subject with the framework of modernist poetry. As would be the case throughout the century, a marginal or excluded group would reinvigorate the culture because their doubleness—the sense of being ""in"" but not completely ""of"" American society—worked to their advantage as artists. Paradoxically, the story of twentieth-century culture was sometimes best told through the eyes of those whom the culture most disdained: women, gays and lesbians, and African Americans."
6689,"A character actor who specialized in comic American ""types,"" James Henry Hackett made his debut in 1826. Here he is shown in the role of Rip Van Winkle, in a play he adapted in 1830 from Washington Irving's story. The role was particularly appropriate for the young United States: the colonial Rip falls asleep and awakens twenty years later, astonished at how America had changed. Hackett went on to have a successful career in both England and the United States. He later moved into theater management, producing, and playwriting. While his contributions to the American theater were great, he always was disappointed that he never succeeded in the major tragic roles.  "
6703,"Abolitionist and women's-rights leader Sojourner Truth worked tirelessly for the poor and disenfranchised in mid-nineteenth-century America. Born into slavery, she changed her name to Sojourner Truth in 1843 to reflect her religious conversion and her commitment to reform. Soon after, she was traveling throughout the nation lecturing about the inhumanity of slavery and the rights of African Americans and women. A tall and imposing figure, she fought especially for the poor, who often had no voice in such debates, as she knew from personal experience, asking famously, ""and ain't I a woman?"" To heighten awareness for her work and to raise funds to support it, Truth sold copies of her autobiography and photographs of herself. As she wrote on the mounts of many of these portraits, ""I sell the shadow to support the substance."""
6744,"Born Glen Ellyn, Illinois  One of the founders of the anthropological dance movement, Katherine Dunham distilled Caribbean and African dance elements into modern American choreography. In the 1930s, she did fieldwork in the Caribbean and infused her choreography with the cultures of that region. She and her company appeared in the 1940 Broadway version of Cabin in the Sky; she collaborated with George Balanchine on the show’s choreography as well as on the 1943 film. Other movie highlights include the 1941 Warner Bros. short Carnival of Rhythm—the first Hollywood dance film shot in Technicolor—and Stormy Weather (1943).   An educator, dancer, and choreographer, Dunham created more than ninety dances. She once wrote, “I am only interested in dance as an education, a means of knowing people.” Artist Boris Chaliapin, best known for his Time magazine covers, asked Dunham to pose for this portrait for his collection of drawings he had made of other noted dancers."
6746,"For six years beginning in 1830, George Catlin traveled the American plains to paint portraits of Indian leaders and make sketches of tribal life. The pictorial record of his travels numbers around five hundred paintings and constitutes a remarkable archive of the American Indian. Hoping that his collection would become the nucleus of a national museum, the artist exhibited his paintings in many eastern cities. After Congress proved indifferent, Catlin in 1839 took his Indian gallery to Europe.              British artist William Fisk painted Catlin when his gallery was on exhibition in London. He has shown Catlin with two Blackfoot Indians, The Woman Who Strikes Many and Iron Horn, images based on paintings by Catlin. Debts forced the artist to sell most of his collection in 1852; the largest portion now belongs to the Smithsonian Institution."
6753,"In November 1861, Captain Charles Wilkes of the U.S. Navy precipitated what would quickly become a diplomatic crisis for the Lincoln administration early in the war. As commander of the USS San Jacinto sailing off the coast of Cuba, Wilkes, acting wholly on his own initiative, commandeered two Confederate envoys-James Mason of Virginia and John Slidell of Louisiana-from a British mail steamer, the Trent.  Great Britain was outraged by this violation of neutral rights and demanded the release of the envoys and an apology from Washington. Lincoln had no choice but to acquiesce or face possible armed retaliation from Great Britain.  Wilkes emerged from the Trent affair relatively unscathed by public opinion and was lauded as a hero in the North. He is also remembered for his scientific explorations and survey of the Antarctic coast in the early 1840s.  "
6804,"Carl Sandburg's profound empathy for the experiences of ordinary people found eloquent expression in his uncluttered and accessible verse. When his best-received volume of poetry, The People, Yes, appeared in 1936, one critic proclaimed, ""a foreigner will find more of America [in its pages] than in any other book."" An accomplished writer of prose as well as poetry, Sandburg also won distinction as a biographer of Lincoln, and in 1940, Abraham Lincoln: The War Years earned him the Pulitzer Prize for History.   Edward Steichen and Carl Sandburg met in 1908, shortly before Steichen's sister, Lilian, became Sandburg's bride. The photographer and the poet became lifelong friends, and their mutual regard fostered a number of collaborations. Steichen found in Sandburg a rewarding subject for his camera, while Sandburg paid tribute to Steichen's genius in the biography Steichen: The Photographer, which he published in 1929."
6925,"Dancer Isadora Duncan scorned the rigid rules of classical ballet and instead defined her art as an expression of natural instinct and inner feeling. Raised in a bohemian atmosphere that almost preordained her departures from convention, she began devising spontaneously choreographed pieces in the 1890s. By the early 1900s she was touring Europe, where her work won a considerable following. In the United States, however, many were scandalized by her minimal costumes and the sensual quality of her performances. Nevertheless, she had her American defenders.  The maker of this picture, Arnold Genthe, was a friend and great admirer of Duncan. ""Her body was not beautiful,"" he recalled in his memoir. ""But when she danced, the nobility of her gestures could make it into something of superb perfection and divine loveliness."""
6940,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    An influential writer and philosopher, Alain Locke compiled his anthology of African American art, poetry, literature, and history in The New Negro (1925), which became a founding document of the Harlem Renaissance. Locke had received both his undergraduate and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard  University; he was the first African American Rhodes Scholar and joined the Howard University faculty in 1912. His studies in Europe focused on cultural pluralism, leading to a series of seminal lectures in 1915 challenging the dominant Darwinian concept of race as fixed and biologically determined. Locke argued instead that race was malleable and determined by one's social and cultural environment-a position widely accepted by the mid-twentieth century. As an intellectual with a strong sense of independence, Locke was criticized by many African Americans as being elitist and was reproached for his opposition to Marcus Garvey's nationalist movement. "
6974,"The author of more than a dozen volumes of verse, Marianne Moore received virtually every major literary award-including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award-that the United States had to offer. Her innovative and exquisitely crafted poems, one critic declared, ""bear the indisputable mark of high style,"" and another described the meanings found in her clean metaphors and symbolism as ""exhilarating."" But perhaps the highest tribute came from fellow poet T. S. Eliot, who placed Moore's work among ""the small body of durable poetry written in our time.""  Moore's poems were filled with references to members of the animal kingdom, and when Life did a story on her in 1953, its editors asked photographer Esther Bubley to photograph the poet as she encountered some of the non-human creatures mentioned in her works. "
6984,"Born Lexington, Virginia    Americans tolerate, and even expect, a high degree of religiosity in their public and political lives. Yet the public is also mindful of the Constitution and the later concept of separation of church and state, so prominent religious figures are nearly always lightning rods for controversy. Such has certainly been the case for the televangelist Pat Robertson, whose conservative doctrine and link between religion and public or national conduct is a prominent influence on contemporary American political culture.  A Southern Baptist who campaigned unsuccessfully for the Republican presidential nomination in 1988, Robertson has used his television ministry as a venue from which to castigate modern Americans for their moral and personal failings. He has prophesized the end of the world because of its corruption and views himself as a modern Noah who will guide his flock to safety while the wicked perish."
7005,"In the fall of 1965 Time reported favorably on the massive U.S. troop buildup in Vietnam and the apparent brighter prospects it promised for ultimate victory, even if it took ten years to achieve. The magazine went all-out on this cover story, sending to the war-ravaged Southeast Asian country a team of six correspondents, a bevy of photographers, and a cover artist, Henry Koerner. His job was to “express the determined U.S. presence in a painting.” Koerner usually preferred painting from life, and this assignment—among the troops in the midst of the fighting zone—was fraught with a sense of urgency that no photograph could have provided him. His inspired painting was reproduced in its entirety as a gatefold cover, which was a rare format for the magazine.   Refuerzo de tropas de EE.UU. en Vietnam     Durante el otoño de 1965, Time reseñó favorablemente el refuerzo masivo de las tropas estadounidenses en Vietnam y lo que parecía una promesa más concreta de lograr la victoria final, aunque esta tardaría diez años. La revista puso un gran esfuerzo en ese artículo de portada y envió al devastado país del sureste asiático un equipo de seis corresponsales, un puñado de fotógrafos y un artista para hacer la portada. Este fue Henry Koerner, a quien se encomendó “expresar la firmeza y determinación de la presencia norteamericana en una pintura”. Koerner prefería pintar del natural, y este encargo que lo colocaba entre las tropas, en plena zona de combate, le inyectó una sensación de urgencia que ninguna foto pudo haberle dado. Su inspirada pintura se reprodujo completa en una portada desplegable, formato muy poco común para la revista.      Henry Koerner (1915–1991)  Óleo sobre lienzo, 1965  Portada de Time, 22 de octubre de 1965"
7020,"Born New York City    African American writer James Baldwin spent most of his adult life in France, and so never numbered among the country's leading civil rights activists in the usual sense. But as one of the most passionate and eloquent writers about the problems of race in America, Baldwin gave substantial impetus to the civil rights ferment of the 1950s and 1960s. Shortly after the publication of his collection of essays The Fire Next Time in 1963, Time magazine featured this cover portrait. One observer said of Baldwin, ""in the U.S. today there is not another writer-white or black-who expresses with such poignancy and abrasiveness the dark realities of American racism."" Among Baldwin's best-known works are Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953), a largely autobiographical novel about growing up in Harlem, and his volume of essays Nobody Knows My Name (1960).  "
7091,"After Laura Bullion's arrest in 1901 for her participation in a Montana train robbery, a St. Louis policeman who was booking her remarked, ""I wouldn't think helping to hold up a train was too much for her. She is cool, shows absolutely no fear, and in male attire would readily pass for a boy."" Bullion was found with forged banknotes and, after being charged, spent the next two and a half years in prison. She admitted to police that her accomplices in the robbery were Harry Longabaugh (the Sundance Kid) and Ben Kilpatrick (the Tall Texan). Although women do not figure prominently in the history of western crime, Bullion was closely associated with the Wild Bunch and helped the gang in numerous robberies. This mug shot of Bullion was made by the police following her arrest in St. Louis.   "
7124,"  Prior to her 1932 solo transatlantic flight, Earhart had nearly completed the manuscript of her second book, The Fun of It. Before submitting it for publication, she wanted to add a final chapter about her latest venture. She made time to complete the chapter only four days after landing in Ireland on May 21, 1932, despite the many invitations and appointments in the days that followed. As she and George Putnam had hoped, the finished book went on sale within weeks of her return to the United States.  This drawing was made by Hugo Gellert, a popular New York illustrator. Inspired by Earhart’s The Fun of It, he created this winning portrait of the aviator not long after her historic 1932 flight. With her head cocked forward and hair streaming back, his image casts her as the epitome of a new, more modern woman."
7134,"Born New Orleans, Louisiana     A leading actress at the turn of the twentieth century, Minnie Maddern Fiske was the only child of actor parents with their own theater company. She debuted on stage at age three as the Duke of York in Richard III and rose to prominence in 1882 when she toured in Fogg’s Ferry by Charles E. Callahan. A proponent of realism in acting, Fiske focused on the internal processes of characters, favoring subtlety over monologues and asides. She championed the work of Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, starring in works such as A Doll’s House. With her second husband, Harrison Grey Fiske, owner of the New York Dramatic Mirror, she spoke vehemently against the Theatrical Syndicate, which employed tactics from the burgeoning industrial trusts to exert a tight monopoly over theater productions and venues around the country.   A member of New York City’s nineteenth-century Cuban elite, José María Mora was one of the foremost stage and society photographers of his time. "
7172,"Born New York City     When Franklin Roosevelt began his first term as president in 1933, his wife Eleanor declared that she was “just going to be plain, ordinary Mrs. Roosevelt. And that’s all.” The reality proved to be quite different, however, for Eleanor Roosevelt soon took public stands on issues ranging from exploitive labor practices to civil rights. When the Daughters of the American Revolution refused permission in 1939 for acclaimed African American contralto Marian Anderson to sing at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., Roosevelt resigned from the DAR and helped arrange for Anderson to perform at the Lincoln Memorial instead. The activism that characterized Eleanor Roosevelt’s years as first lady did not end with her departure from the White House. As a United States delegate to the United Nations (1945–53), she was instrumental in formulating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and securing its ratification by the General Assembly in 1948."
7244,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  The son of a naval officer, Samuel Woodhouse was trained as a physician at the University of Pennsylvania. He subsequently served as the medical officer in a succession of organizations that included the U.S. Army, a transatlantic steamship line, and the Eastern State Penitentiary. As an army officer, he served on several exploratory missions to the American West, as well as to Central America. He made the first survey of birds in the Oklahoma Territory and was the first naturalist to survey the Arizona region, discovering several hitherto unknown specimens, including a toad (Bufo woodhousii) that is named after him. He was a member of the American Academy of Natural Sciences, and his journals are a repository of firsthand observations of the natural and human ecologies of the American West."
7311,"Through his short stories and essays, Bret Harte presented many Americans with their first taste of the society that the California gold rush had produced. In stories such as ""The Luck of Roaring Camp"" and ""The Outcasts of Poker Flat,"" Harte brought to life a colorful assortment of gamblers, miners, and other adventurers who, like him, had settled in California. Returning east in 1871, he found himself lionized as the West's signature writer. But Harte never felt any real kinship with the crude world he portrayed, and his later western stories paled in comparison to the crisply narrated tales that made him a celebrity. By 1878 Harte was sailing for Europe, where even his lesser works continued to find an appreciative audience. There he remained for the rest of his life, grinding out hackneyed variations of his original themes and settings."
7348,"Elaine had known dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham and his partner, the composer John Cage, since the mid-1940s. They had all spent the summer of 1948 at Black Mountain College in western North Carolina, where she, having studied dance as a child, took classes from Cunningham, two hours a day, six days a week. In the portrait, one of Elaine’s series of ""standing men"" from the early 1960s, Cunningham’s lean body, strong, slanting shoulders, and almost leonine head are captured in a dark silhouette surrounded by thin washes of color. One critic noted of her portraits from this time: ""Even when she paints directly, she paints what she remembers of a person—walking, standing, scratching, yawning, thinking, sitting—all of these summed up in a pose. For her each person has his or her pose. The pose is the person. Before setting to work on a portrait, she first visualizes her sitter in their ‘right pose.’""  Elaine conocía al bailarín y coreógrafo Merce Cunningham y su compañero, el compositor John Cage, desde mediados de los años cuarenta. Todos habían pasado el verano de 1948 en el Black Mountain College, al oeste de Carolina del Norte, donde ella, que había tomado clases de ballet cuando niña, ahora estudiaba con Cunningham dos horas al día, seis días a la semana. El retrato pertenece a la serie de “hombres de pie” que Elaine realizó a principios de los años sesenta; capta el cuerpo fuerte y esbelto de Cunningham, sus hombros un tanto caídos y su cabeza casi leonina en una silueta oscura rodeada de finas aguadas de color. Un crítico observó lo siguiente sobre los retratos de esta época: “Incluso cuando pinta del vivo, pinta lo que recuerda de la persona, cómo camina, se para, se rasca, bosteza, piensa, se sienta, todo eso resumido en una pose. Para ella, cada persona tiene su pose única. La pose es la persona. Antes de empezar a trabajar un retrato, primero visualiza a su modelo en ‘la pose correcta’”. "
7408,"Mr. West's Garden, Gallery and Painting Room    By the time he painted this work, Benjamin West had come a long way from his humble beginnings as the son of a rural Pennsylvania innkeeper. His elegant establishment at 14 Newman Street in London reflected his status as history painter to George III and his position as president of the Royal Academy. Here, the West family is posed in front of the long gallery where the artist hung his sketches, drawings, and smaller paintings. That gallery led to the large painting room, where West-along with his many students and apprentices-worked and exhibited his enormous history canvases.   "
7412,"The death of Colonel Elmer E. Ellsworth in Alexandria, Virginia, was a flash point at the start of the Civil War. Ellsworth was the first Union officer to be killed in the four-year-long struggle. He commanded the Eleventh New York Fire Zouaves, which participated in the invasion of Northern Virginia on May 24, 1861. His death at the hands of a local innkeeper made him a martyr in the North. Ellsworth's funeral took place in the White House, where thousands viewed his corpse lying in state. Throughout the conflict, he would be recalled on stationary, in sheet music, and in lithographs."
7460,Memorial print of Colonel Ellsworth    Based on an 1861 photograph by Mathew Brady-believed to be the last taken of Ellsworth-this memorial lithograph of the commander of the New York Fire Zouaves was made soon after his death and is dedicated to the firemen of the United States.
7600,"In his quest to capture boxing's heavyweight crown, Jersey Joe Walcott endured setbacks that might have discouraged a less-determined fighter. Turning pro at the age of sixteen, Walcott boxed intermittently for seventeen years before getting his first shot at the heavyweight title when he took on defending champion Joe Louis in December 1947. Seemingly headed for victory, Walcott suffered a heartbreaking defeat on a split decision after fifteen rounds, and lost again to Louis in the first round of a rematch the following year. After Louis's retirement, Jersey Joe lost two title bouts to Ezzard Charles, but in their third matchup (1951), the thirty-seven-year-old Walcott finally prevailed to win the heavyweight championship. He retained his hard-earned crown until September 23, 1952, when he was felled by a knockout from Rocky Marciano in one of boxing's greatest contests."
7625,"Sculptor Leonard Volk took castings of Lincoln's hands at Lincoln's home in Springfield, Illinois, in late May of 1860. Lincoln had just won the Republican presidential nomination, and Volk was already thinking of using these castings, in combination with his recently completed Lincoln bust, to fashion a full-length statue. Lincoln's right hand grasps a section of broom handle that he obligingly fetched from a shed when the artist suggested that he hold on to something. When Lincoln began smoothing the edges of the sawed piece, Volk told him that it really was unnecessary, to which Lincoln replied, ""I thought I would like to have it nice.""  "
7635,"Born Atlanta, Georgia    Under the inspired leadership of Martin Luther King Jr., nonviolent protest became the defining feature of the civil rights movement. A brilliant strategist, King first demonstrated the efficacy of passive resistance in 1955, when he led the prolonged bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama, that resulted in the dismantling of bus segregation laws. Fresh from a victory that had brought him national recognition, the charismatic young clergyman helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and took the lead in directing its civil rights initiatives. In a carefully orchestrated campaign of peaceful protest to expose and defeat racial injustice, King awakened the nation's conscience and galvanized support for the landmark civil rights legislation of the 1960s. King's words were as powerful as his deeds, and the moving and eloquent addresses that gave hope to millions continue to inspire people throughout the world."
7641,"Born near Easton, Maryland  Frederick Douglass became the first nationally known African American in U.S. history by turning his life into a testimony on the evils of slavery and the redemptive power of freedom. He had escaped from slavery in 1838 and subsequently became a powerful witness for abolitionism, speaking, writing, and organizing on behalf of the movement; he also founded a newspaper, the North Star. Douglass's charisma derived from his ability to present himself as the author of his own destiny at a time when white America could barely conceive of the black man as a thinking and feeling human being. The Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass is not only gripping nonfiction account of one man's struggle for freedom; it is also one of the greatest American autobiographies. This powerful portrait shows Douglass as he grew in prominence during the 1840s."
7751,"Earhart sits in the unfinished engine casing of the Lockheed Electra in this photograph. With its two engines and state-of-the-art communications equipment, the Electra was one of the most advanced aircrafts ever built. When she was not lecturing to public audiences, overseeing her new Los Angeles–based flying school, or teaching at Purdue, Earhart immersed herself in planning for an around-the-world flight. During this period, she also recruited two experienced navigators, Harry Manning and Fred Noonan, to accompany her. On March 17, 1937, they took off from Oakland, heading southwest to their first destination, Hawaii. This attempt at circumnavigating the globe was abandoned shortly thereafter when Earhart lost control of the plane during a take-off from Honolulu. The damaged Electra had to be shipped back to California for repairs, and the much-anticipated trip was suddenly in jeopardy."
7752,"Showman P. T. Barnum was as skilled in promoting legitimate entertainment as he was in marketing outlandish frauds. In 1842, he scored one of his greatest triumphs when he discovered the diminutive Charles Stratton and introduced him to the public as ""Tom Thumb."" The four-year-old Stratton, who was just twenty-five inches tall and weighed only fifteen pounds, was transformed under Barnum's tutelage into a phenomenally popular entertainer who sang, danced, and performed a variety of costumed roles. Memorialized in this double portrait, the long-lived and amiable partnership between ""Tom Thumb"" and the ""Prince of Humbug"" generated substantial fortunes for both men.  "
7823,"After the Allies drove the German army out of Paris in August 1944, the bar at the city's Hotel Scribe became a favorite haunt for journalists. As one observer put it, an outgoing stream of ""spruce correspondents"" was always leaving the bar's comforts for the front lines and an incoming flow of ""disheveled correspondents"" just back from the front was eager to fill their seats. Among the Scribe's patrons was war illustrator Floyd Davis, who painted this picture for Life magazine, showing the bar filled with reporters who gathered there to talk over their news stories and complain about army press censorship. Among the individuals featured are New Yorker reporter Janet Flanner and CBS newscaster William Shirer seated at a table (lower center) with Ernest Hemingway. The unshaven, helmeted figure in the left rear is the famed war photographer Robert Capa.  "
7869,"Born Dutchess County, New York   Franklin Roosevelt’s haughty expression in Aurelius Battaglia’s caricature conveys his aristocratic background. The Roosevelts settled in America in the mid-seventeenth century. By the time of the American Revolution they enjoyed the status of landed gentry in New York’s Hudson River Valley, occupying leading roles in the state’s commercial, civic, and social life. Roosevelt was drawn—as were many from the upper-middle or upper class—to public service and politics. He was also fascinated by the example of his famous fifth cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, whom Franklin declared ""the greatest man I ever knew."" By the time this drawing was made, Franklin Roosevelt had served in the New York State Senate and as assistant secretary of the navy under President Woodrow Wilson; been James M. Cox’s running-mate in the 1920 presidential election; contracted polio in 1921; and served as governor of New York. "
7882,"Willie ""The Lion"" Smith was a jazz pianist, songwriter, and raconteur at the center of the vibrant New York music scene for a half century. At first a successful ragtime pianist on the East Coast, Smith fought in World War I with the famous Harlem Hellfighters division. In the 1920s The Lion, James P. Johnson, and Fats Waller formed an unholy trinity of New York City pianist-composers who created the tempo and dances of the time. Duke Ellington apprenticed to his musical leadership and stride style, and a young George Gershwin absorbed jazz sitting under Smith’s piano at Harlem rent parties. The Lion evoked his time in several later records and in his memoir, Music on My Mind (1964). His style is ingrained in jazz iconography, as can be seen here: relaxed at the piano in his trademark derby and with his cigar, he awaits the night’s crowd and warms up the keyboard."
7942,"During a visit to Munich in 1847, Henry Meade first met Lola Montez, the notorious beauty then known as the Countess of Landsfeldt. When Montez came to New York to make her American debut as a dancer in December 1851, she posed for portraits at the Meade Brothers’ Broadway gallery. Delighted with the results, she later praised a lithograph based on one of their daguerreotypes as ""the best likeness I have yet had taken of myself."" On subsequent trips to New York, Montez returned to Meade Brothers for additional sittings, one of which yielded this daguerreotype."
7964,"Like her portrait of Fairfield Porter, this painting of art critic and editor Thomas B. Hess (1920–1978) was based on a precisely dated drawing, which served as the starting point for this free and gestural painting. Elaine wrote, ""some men sit all closed up—legs crossed, arms folded across the chest. Others are wide open."" Her likeness of Hess, a mix of harsh yellows, greens, grays, and dark red lines, is an unusual example of her work from this time, in both the closed pose and the coloring. Hess described Elaine’s portraits as containing ""meticulously observed and rendered faces [attached to] anatomies spun from bravura paint ribbons."" Hess was a close friend as well as a colleague, and he had hired Elaine in 1948 to write reviews and then feature articles for ARTnews. By 1956, when this painting was made, he was championing her work as well as that of Willem, which he had promoted since the early 1950s.  Al igual que el retrato de Fairfield Porter, esta pintura del crítico de arte y editor Thomas B. Hess (1920–1978) se basa en un dibujo fechado que sirvió de base para esta obra gestual de trazos libres. Elaine escribe que “algunos hombres se sientan de manera muy reservada, con las piernas cruzadas y los brazos sobre el pecho. Otros son más extrovertidos”. Esta imagen de Hess, con su mezcla de fuertes amarillos, verdes, grises y líneas rojo oscuro, es un raro ejemplo del trabajo de la artista en esta época, tanto por la pose reservada como por el colorido. Hess decía que los retratos de Elaine tenían “rostros observados y representados minuciosamente, [adheridos a] cuerpos tejidos con bravura en cintas de pintura”. Hess, buen amigo y colega de Elaine, la contrató en 1948 para escribir reseñas y luego artículos en ARTnews. Ya para 1956, año de esta pintura, él estaba promoviendo su obra artística, como lo había hecho con la de Willem desde principios de la década. "
7990,"Eighteen days after Martin Luther King delivered his stirring ""I Have a Dream"" speech before tens of thousands at the March on Washington, 400 parishioners gathered for Sunday services in the Birmingham, Alabama, church that recently had served as the headquarters for King's desegregation initiatives in that city. At 10:22 a.m. on September 15, 1963, dynamite planted by white extremists ripped through the basement of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, killing Sunday school students Addie Mae Collins, Denise McNair, Carole Robinson, and Cynthia Wesley. As grieving families and congregants mourned these young victims of racial hatred, civil rights activists assembled in Birmingham to attend the girls' funeral. Among those present were Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) leaders Julian Bond (second from left) and John Lewis (third from right), who were captured in this image by SNCC photographer Danny Lyon as they stood across the street from the bomb-blasted church.  "
8213,"Creating a distinctly American verse, Walt Whitman kicked down the doors and jambs of genteel Anglo-American literature and took poetry out into the streets and roads of a turbulent and expansive democracy. Whitman sounded his “barbaric yawp” across rooftops and into Leaves of Grass (first published in 1855). His poetic tendency to list, categorize, or catalogue was a legacy of the Enlightenment, yet his joyful earthiness was a far cry from the Enlightenment’s cool rationalism. And whereas his contemporaries, especially Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, recoiled from the unfixed and unmoored nature of American society, Whitman alone vaulted into the future, not simply walking on the open road but building it as he went along, surveying the ever-changing face of America and Americans. Whitman was also one of the first Americans to comprehend the power of photography to shape a reputation. Photography’s ability to project multiple, diverse personas to the public was naturally appealing to a poet celebrating his—and our—multiple selves. Everywhere and nowhere—that is the paradox of Walt Whitman. In all of his chanting, he still has time to sum himself up in a way that endures: “I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured. / I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!).”"
8259,"Born Yalta, Russian Crimea  Having studied with the famous actor and teacher Constantin Stanislavsky in Russia, Alla Nazimova came to New York City with a Russian troupe of actors and decided to stay. She, like her teacher, worked hard to “become” her characters, rather than to seek recognition for her own stage personality. In 1906 and 1907, she demonstrated this gift by playing the leads in New York productions of Henrik Ibsen’s plays A Doll’s House and Hedda Gabler. Critics marveled at the totality of her shift from one character to another.  Edward Simmons captured Nazimova's dramatic flair and beauty in this painting, done at the height of her reputation. In later years, she fluctuated between the stage and roles in early Hollywood motion pictures."
8272,"When Harry Truman arrived at his home in Independence, Missouri, on Saturday, June 24, 1950, he was looking forward to a relaxing weekend. But that evening he received a call informing him that Communist North Korea had invaded South Korea, and early Sunday he was returning to Washington to confront the crisis. Truman later said that framing a response to the invasion was the hardest task of his presidency. On June 27, he announced that the United States was committing its armed forces to driving out South Korea's invader. This photograph was taken shortly after the announcement, as the president chatted with some of his advisers on the White House grounds. Truman stands at the center, with his back to the camera. Opposite and to the right is Secretary of State Dean Acheson, who had a large voice in framing the Korean response.  "
8292,"Thomas Eakins, who would one day be regarded as America's leading realist painter of the nineteenth century, posed with his sister for this portrait when he was about seven years old. A member of the first generation to grow up with the new medium of photography, Eakins came to appreciate the camera's value as an artistic aid and as a teaching tool. Although he never publicly acknowledged the role that the camera played in his work, Eakins used photography to create studies for many of his paintings; to assist him in working out complex compositions; and to enhance his ability to depict figures in motion."
8320,"Eight years before Franklin Roosevelt first ran for president, he was espousing progressivism as a national mandate for confronting the nation's problems, much like his fifth cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, had done two decades earlier. ""The Democratic Party is the Progressive party of the country,"" FDR proclaimed in 1924."" Two years later, he warned that ""a nation or a state which is unwilling by governmental action to tackle the new problems . . . is headed for decline and ultimate death."" Given the subsequent hardships of the Great Depression, Roosevelt as president found himself at the head of the class in caricaturist Adolf Dehn's Progressive School for Democrats. Roosevelt's New Deal was largely an experimental program of reforms like Social Security, Federal Deposit Insurance, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, which at the very least promised to be lessons in federal entitlements and interventions."
8328,"Ronald Reagan wins reelection in 1984     Time’s cover story, headlined “Reagan Triumph,” analyzed Reagan’s victory over Walter Mondale by a lopsided popular and electoral vote. The economy, which he viewed as his first priority, had improved, growing at an 8.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 1982, but federal deficits ballooned and unemployment stood at a troubling 7.4 percent. By late 1984, inflation was down, personal and industrial income had substantially increased, the stock market reached a record high, and the number of workers earning only the mandated minimum wage declined. Reagan also succeeded with his defense buildup, and despite considerable opposition he deployed Pershing missiles in Western Europe. He had achieved his two most important priorities: restoring and expanding the economy and increasing the country’s defense capabilities.   "
8417,"One of America's most influential Protestant theologians in the twentieth century, Reinhold Niebuhr became nationally known in the 1920s for his oratory and support of socialist causes. He fought against Henry Ford's labor policies, argued for the abolition of private property, and became a socialist candidate for the New York State Senate. However, his Moral Man and Immoral Society (1932) signaled a move away from socialism and toward the liberal theology of love. By the late 1930s, he insisted that class warfare must be put aside for the battle against fascism because a Nazi victory would devastate Western civilization. In 1944, one of his major works, The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness, synthesized the Christian doctrine of mankind's dual nature (the capacity to do good and evil) with democratic theory and capitalism, and became an ideological basis for post-World War II liberalism."
8522,"Jackson Pollock stood at the pinnacle of abstract expressionism in post-World War II America. ""On the floor I am more at ease. I feel nearer, more a part of the painting, since this way I can walk around it, work from the four sides and literally be in the painting."" In a series of 500 photographs and two films, photographer Hans Namuth captured Pollock's ""action painting,"" revealing his signature pouring technique to the world. Most important, Namuth captured Pollock's eccentric artistic ritual, which included dancing around, and often on, an unstretched canvas on the studio floor while unconsciously painting with brush, spatula, or even directly from a paint can. Through the act of artistic creation, Pollock sought self-control and self-discovery, often realizing both, or regrettably, neither. Ironically, both Pollock and Namuth died in auto accidents thirty-four years-but only a few miles-apart.  "
8530,"Charles Meade and Marietta Frances Roff of Greenpoint, Long Island, were married at the Washington Square Reformed Church in New York City on June 17, 1851. They welcomed their first child, Kate Frances Meade, on March 19, 1852; their son Henry Almon Meade was born a year later. In this portrait Kate and Henry pose with their arms around each other. As was customary for little boys at this time, Henry (right) wears a skirted costume rather than trousers. "
8660,"Born Charles Town (now Charleston), South Carolina    South Carolina merchant and planter Henry Laurens, sent by the Continental Congress to secure a much-needed loan from Holland, was captured by the British on the high seas and imprisoned for fifteen months in the Tower of London. Finally exchanged after the Battle of Yorktown­ for General Charles Cornwallis, Laurens posed for his portrait in his capacity as president of the Continental Congress (1777–78). Shortly thereafter he was instructed to join Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, and John Adams as a member of the peace commission. Laurens arrived at Paris just two days before the preliminary treaty bringing the Revolution to a close was signed on November 30, 1782. He inserted a line in the treaty to prevent the British army from “carrying away any Negroes or other property.”"
8670,"In the spring of 1876 Curly accepted an invitation to scout for George A. Custer and his Seventh Cavalry during their armed engagement with hostile tribes on the northern plains. His own tribe, the Crow, had previously made peace with the United States. In late June-about a week before the United States was to celebrate its centennial-a force of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors soundly defeated Custer and his command at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana. Curly was the only survivor from the main part of that fight. Two days after the battle he reached military authorities and became the first eyewitness to report details about ""Custer's last stand."" The news shocked the nation and prompted the U.S. Army to redouble its commitment to subduing hostile tribes in the West. In the years that followed, Curly lived on the Crow reservation, serving for a time in the tribal police force."
8689,"Until well into her thirties, Julia Child had never given much thought to food. In 1948, however, with her husband stationed in Paris, she began taking classes at France's Cordon Bleu cooking school, and suddenly her husband was declaring himself a ""Cordon Bleu widower."" With two French friends she started a cooking school and began collaborating with them on Mastering the Art of French Cooking, which is still considered one of the finest American books on French cuisine. Child's career as a cooking expert had yet to reach its full bloom, however. In 1963, she made her debut as The French Chef on public television. Speaking in a high, chirpy voice, she made mistakes and dropped food. But audiences loved her as much for her frailties as for her expertise, and by the late 1960s she had clearly become a significant force in shaping America's dietary mores. "
8745,"Woody Guthrie was a songwriter and folksinger who created the genre of ""Americana"" music, and he is the link between Walt Whitman, Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, Ani DiFranco, and Wilco. He grew up an ""Okie"" during the Great Depression and wrote a series of Dust Bowl ballads crystallizing that experience. Guthrie affected a folksy persona as a hillbilly bard, but he was more a wandering bohemian, often unable to meet his family obligations. An avowed socialist and labor-union activist, he created the modern protest song and thought of himself as a voice of the voiceless. He believed songs should be weapons of psychological liberation and scrawled ""This Machine Kills Fascists"" across his guitar. Guthrie often ended shows by saying, ""Take it easy, but take it,"" recommending a certain cool self-possession in the face of economic oppression. Many Americans consider Guthrie’s ""This Land Is Your Land"" to be the real national anthem."
8812,"In the early decades of the twentieth century, when waves of immigration and explosive urban growth transformed the face of America, George Gershwin emerged as a transcendent voice of modernism. His staccato-paced, syncopated rhythms helped define the Jazz Age on Broadway in the 1920s in such shows as Lady Be Good and Girl Crazy. At the height of the Great Depression, his ""folk opera"" Porgy and Bess attempted to catch the clash and blends of cultural ""interfusions"" that he saw as distinctively American. And he was part of the Hollywood scene during the golden age of the silver screen, notably completing-with his lyricist brother Ira-the score for The Goldwyn Follies just before his death in 1937, at age thirty-nine. Gershwin had become a centrifugal force in the lively arts in years marked by a search for a modern American identity."
8814,"Born Boston, Massachusetts    The son of the esteemed Puritan minister Increase Mather, Cotton Mather built a life and career that was centered on service to his religion and to the colony that the Puritans built in New England. Despite having a stutter, Mather was a precocious child, and he entered Harvard College at age twelve. Beginning in 1685, the year of his ordination, he served together alongside his father at the influential North, or Second, Church of Boston and in time became regarded as one of the region's leading religious figures. Although he did not instigate the witch trials in nearby Salem in 1692, Mather tried to contain the crisis and was uneasy about the way the trials were conducted. He ultimately, however, defended the execution of twenty who had been accused of witchcraft. Mather was the author of more than 450 books and pamphlets, including the famous Magnalia Christi Americana (1702), a wide-ranging history of the Puritans in New England. Throughout his life, he worked tirelessly to preserve the traditional Puritan faith."
8826,"As editor of the influential New York Tribune, Horace Greeley did not so much seek to report on the Civil War as he sought to shape its course. When, in the spring of 1861, Lincoln's administration seemed reluctant to use force in subduing southern secession, Greeley's Tribune carried such bellicose headlines as ""No Concessions to Traitors!"" Shortly thereafter, when Lincoln held back from declaring an end to slavery, Greeley argued that the freedom of blacks must be made one of the Civil War's primary imperatives. It is difficult to say just how much Greeley's editorial declarations affected official Union policies. Still, there is no doubt that his condemnation of the South and his calls for slavery's immediate abolition strongly influenced many northerners.  "
8843,"A high-kicking right hander with a blistering fastball and phenomenal control, Juan Marichal made his major league debut with the San Francisco Giants in July 1960 by hurling a legendary one-hit shutout against the Philadelphia Phillies. Marichal's unorthodox, catapult-style delivery and his arsenal of sliders, curves, screwballs, and change-ups left batters shaking their heads. As Pittsburgh Pirates great Roberto Clemente observed, ""It doesn't matter what he throws; when he's got it, he beats you."" One of the best pitchers in baseball throughout the 1960s, Marichal surpassed the twenty-game-victory mark six times between 1963 and 1969, and ended the decade with a total of 191 wins. It was not until 1972 that he experienced his first losing season. In 1983 Marichal became the first Latin American player inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame via the regular selection process."
8897,"Part of Gardner’s Antietam series, this photograph introduces Major General John A. McClernand, one of the “political” generals whom Lincoln had to support to shore up his position on the home front but whose military inexperience (or incompetence) hindered the Union army. McClernand was raised in Illinois and, as a Democrat, knew Lincoln when they were both state representatives. A congressman in 1861, he resigned from the House of Representatives when Lincoln, who was looking for allies among Unionist Democrats, appointed him brigadier general of the Illinois volunteers. He served mostly in the West, where he angered both Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman, not least because of his egotism and ceaseless lobbying for an independent command. In October 1862 he was on leave in Washington to argue his case and accompanied the presidential party on its trip to George McClellan’s headquarters in Maryland. After continuing to perform poorly in command, McClernand left the army in 1864."
8906,"Born Stratford, Westmoreland County, Virginia     When General Robert E. Lee rode away from Appomattox Court House in April 1865, the only certainty in his life was change. Like the nation, he would embrace peace and reunification, but like southerners in general he faced the challenges of rebuilding. For Lee personally, he was a civilian once more after a military career of nearly thirty-six years. In June he applied for a pardon—which allegedly was lost by federal bureaucrats—and in August he was elected president of Washington College in Lexington, Virginia, a position he would hold until his death in October 1870. Never intending to be the model of a reconstructed Confederate, he was looked upon as such—revered in the South and respected in the North. "
8909,"Until James Kent, retired chancellor of New York, began publication of his Commentaries on American Law in 1826, no one had written about the American legal system as a whole. Kent's landmark four volumes, finished in 1830 (close to the time he underwent the ""wonderful irksome"" task of sitting for his portrait), examined international law, American constitutional law, the sources of state law, and the law of personal rights and property.   A staunch conservative who deplored expanding suffrage beyond property owners, Kent was a champion of individual rights. In response to a temperance committee plea that he set an example by signing an abstinence pledge, he declared: ""I never have been drunk, and, by the blessing of God, I never will get drunk, but I have a constitutional privilege to get drunk, and that privilege I will not sign away.""  "
8925,"Lorraine Hansberry never finished several early attempts at playwriting. In 1956, however, she began work on a drama about a black family's attempt to buy a house in a ""white"" neighborhood that did not want them. This time, fired by memories of how a similar experience had scarred her own family, she completed the play. Titled A Raisin the Sun, it opened on Broadway to glowing reviews in March 1959. The following month, Hansberry became the first African American playwright to win the coveted New York Drama Critics' Circle award. A longtime civil rights activist, Hansberry soon emerged as an outspoken supporter of the movement's increasing militance. Declaring that African Americans had ""a great deal to be angry about,"" she warned that chaos could result if the federal government failed to move decisively to combat racial injustice.  "
8987,"The skilled draftsmen of Walt Disney's studio in the 1930s studied art history and the physics of movement. Joe Grant, a ""story man"" at the studio, invented characters for the cartoons and drew carefully posed images for animation teams to imitate. His exquisitely rendered image of Oliver Hardy atop a look-alike pony was one of four model drawings for ""Mickey's Polo Team,"" a Disney cartoon inspired by Hollywood's passion for the sport. Part of a popular comedy team with Stan Laurel, Hardy had graceful, genteel mannerisms, despite his bulk. Here, his artfully extended little fingers are mimicked by the dainty movement of his pony's feet. Grant developed both rotund creatures with clearly visible circular forms. Rounded shapes not only suited the subject, they were faster to draw and created a smoother flow of movement when animated."
9006,"The composer of such rousing tunes as ""Give My Regards to Broadway,"" ""You're a Grand Old Flag,"" and the World War I anthem ""Over There,"" George M. Cohan was described by Vanity Fair in 1933 as ""one of our great American institutions and one of the best beloved figures of our theatrical world."" Cohan, who claimed a birth date of July 4, was only a boy when he began performing with his parents and sister as part of a popular vaudeville act. He published his first song at sixteen and soon turned to writing and performing in musical comedies. Although his earliest efforts failed to enchant the critics, Cohan scored a huge hit with Little Johnny Jones (1904), in which he introduced the flag-waving number ""Yankee Doodle Boy."" He went on to great success as a playwright, actor, and theatrical producer."
9018,"Born Savannah, Georgia      Elegantly depicted by British artist Edward Hughes, Juliette Gordon Low radiates the luxury of elite American birth and marriage to a wealthy Englishman. Low’s satisfaction with her privileged lifestyle, however, soon faded. Following her unfaithful husband’s death, she became interested in the Girl Guides, an organization established by her friend, British general Sir Robert Baden-Powell, who had also founded the Boy Scouts. Working with disadvantaged girls living near her Scottish estate, Low became a troop leader, imparting practical skills to her charges. After creating troops in London, Low brought the idea to the United States, establishing a troop in 1912 in her hometown of Savannah, Georgia. Three years later, Low incorporated the Girl Scouts of America. Today the organization continues to inspire girls to pursue “the highest ideals of character, conduct, patriotism, and service that they may become happy and resourceful citizens.”"
9086,"Born Los Angeles, California  German-born artist Winold Reiss challenged the racial typing of minorities by portraying his black, Native American, and Asian subjects as dignified individuals. His portrait of sculptor Isamu Noguchi defied the ""yellow peril"" stereotyping that followed the 1924 National Origins Act banning Chinese and Japanese immigration. With his frontal pose and bold, confrontational gaze, Noguchi, whose father was Japanese, appears as a self-assured, thoroughly modern young American. The abstract background hints at that mix of the organic and geometric that characterized Noguchi’s sculpture. At the time, Noguchi had just returned from Paris on a Guggenheim Fellowship. In his grant application, he had stated how he planned to reconcile his dual ethnicity through art: ""My father . . . has long been known as an interpreter of the East to the West, through poetry. I wish to do the same with sculpture."""
9321,"Tenor Roland Hayes was the first African American singer to earn an international reputation on the concert stage. Hayes studied at Fisk University and later trained in Boston, where he marked his professional debut in 1917 with a recital of operatic arias, continental art songs, and African American spirituals. After touring with some success at home, Hayes traveled to Europe in 1921 for a series of concert engagements that earned him glowing notices and marked a turning point in his career. Back in the United States, he was greeted with great enthusiasm by American concert audiences, who responded to the poignancy and emotional power of his singing. Mindful of his role in breaking barriers that had prevented black Americans from pursuing concert careers, Hayes observed, ""I live to encourage my race and see them rise from the bondage of centuries."""
9379,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
9400,"Financier Bernard Baruch never held elected office, but as an adviser to every president from Woodrow Wilson to John F. Kennedy, he helped to influence public policy for decades. After amassing a fortune in the stock market, Baruch made the transition from Wall Street to Washington in 1916, when Woodrow Wilson named him to the Advisory Commission of the Council for National Defense. Following the United States's entry into World War I, Baruch distinguished himself as chairman of the War Industries Board, where he masterminded the nation's wartime industrial mobilization. In peacetime, he remained a valued although often unofficial economic adviser who relished his behind-the-scenes role as ""Democracy's silent partner."" During World War II, Baruch counseled those tasked with the war mobilization effort, and in the postwar period, he served as the first U.S. representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission.  "
9405,"In 1779 Henry Laurens commissioned Charles Willson Peale to paint a portrait of Thomas Paine that he intended to take with him as he sailed to Holland to raise money for the Continental Congress. Laurens was captured by a British ship on the high seas and the Peale portrait was confiscated. Eventually finding its way into the hands of a Paine admirer, it was engraved in 1783. ""A portrait of Common Sense may be had . . . by sending to the printshops in London,"" a sharp-eyed Marylander reported, ""but they have put a wrong name to it, his being Thomas."" The original oil painting has dropped from sight, as has the duplicate that Peale added to his collection of likenesses of those who had played major roles in the American Revolution. "
9406,"Following Rosa Parks's arrest in 1955 for refusing to give up her seat on a bus to a white passenger, Ralph Abernathy and Martin Luther King Jr. established the Montgomery Improvement Association to boycott that Alabama city's segregated public transportation system. Under its auspices, African Americans organized carpools or simply walked to their destinations. As the pastor of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery-the location for this photograph by Collier's photojournalist Dan Weiner-Abernathy preached nonviolence as the most effective tactic in the struggle for integration. Although both his church and his home were bombed in 1957, the boycott achieved its desired result. Abernathy became one of King's most trusted advisers, serving as the secretary-treasurer of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and marching alongside King at numerous demonstrations. As fellow activist Hosea Williams noted, ""Martin wouldn't make a decision without him."""
9441,"Novelist Sinclair Lewis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1930, the first American to be so honored. His satirical novels critical of aspects of the American character and American institutions included Main Street, Babbitt, Arrowsmith, Elmer Gantry, and Dodsworth, all published between 1920 and 1929. Davidson had met Lewis in 1907 at the Socialist colony that Upton Sinclair founded in New Jersey. The portrait was done at Davidson's request: ""I had been wanting to do him for a long time. But old friends shy away with, 'What do you want to do me for?' As usual they end up by posing."""
9554,"Thirty-seventh President, 1969-74    This 1968 election cover image of Richard Nixon marks one of the most noteworthy comebacks in American politics. Six years earlier, pundits had written him off as a has-been after his unsuccessful bid for the California governorship, which had come on top of his historically close loss to John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election. Even Nixon himself had admitted publicly that he was through with politics. But that appraisal took into account neither the depth of Nixon's ambitions for high office nor his dogged determination, and this portrait accompanied Time's story on how Nixon had just won election to the presidency.  Nixon's likeness was the work of illustrator Louis Glanzman, who had learned his profession almost totally through self-instruction. Although his knowledge of composition was derived from copying reproductions of noted paintings, he relied largely on comic books for perfecting his skills in depicting action.     Time cover, November 15, 1968"
9591,"This cartoon by Nathaniel Currier addresses the 1856 presidential election, which became a political contest among three candidates. The overriding issues were slavery in the states, states’ rights, and the expansion of slavery in the new territories. Former President Millard Fillmore (right), candidate for the new Know Nothing, or American, Party, criticized the abolitionist leanings of the new Republican Party, represented by preacher Henry Ward Beecher, editor Horace Greeley, and western explorer and party candidate John C. Frémont (left). In the end, Democratic nominee James Buchanan, shown as the buck, won the election, benefiting from the sectional divisiveness that was resulting in national discord. Buchanan, a Pennsylvanian and no advocate of human bondage, nevertheless defended the doctrine of states’ rights, which protected the institution of slavery in the South and allowed its expansion in the newly forming states in the West. "
9600,"Born New York City  When Franklin D. Roosevelt took the presidential oath in March 1933, his wife Eleanor entered the White House declaring that she was ""just going to be plain, ordinary Mrs. Roosevelt. And that’s all."" The promise was not long kept. Driven by her own keen sense of social and economic justice, Eleanor Roosevelt soon was deeply engrossed in New Deal politics. Touring the nation’s economically distressed communities, she returned to Washington fired with enthusiasm for federally sponsored planned communities. She also made speeches and gave press conferences, where she addressed such issues as child labor and sweatshops. Perhaps most important, she urged her husband toward various reforms that he might otherwise have avoided in the name of political expediency. As she herself noted, ""I think I sometimes acted as a spur even though the spurring was not always welcome."""
9618,"Thirty-sixth President, 1963-69    Named Time's 1964 Man of the Year because of his remarkable presidential successes, Lyndon Johnson received that distinction again in 1967 for his perceived failures. Violently scorned for escalating the Vietnam War, chastised by African Americans for moving too slowly on civil rights, and hounded in Congress for the costliness of his ambitious domestic programs, Johnson had even been deserted by much of his own Democratic Party. By the end of 1967, his approval rating had plummeted from a peak of 80 percent to 38 percent.   For this portrait, caricaturist David Levine took his inspiration from Shakespeare's tale of King Lear, a man who ran afoul of his children and his own good intentions. In it, the president-cast as a doleful monarch-stands beleaguered by fellow Democrats Senator Robert Kennedy and Representative Wilbur Mills, who connive at eroding his power. Only one member of Johnson's ""family"" remained loyal: Vice President Hubert Humphrey.    Time cover, January 5, 1968"
9663,"Daniel Webster commemorative medal  After the deaths of Henry Clay and Daniel Webster in 1852, Gleason’s Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion reported that ""the last pictures ever taken of those distinguished patriots"" could be seen at the Meade Brothers’ gallery. It also noted that the artist Charles Cushing Wright was preparing commemorative medals, modeled after the Meades’ ""profile views of the illustrious statesman [Webster]."" As Henry Meade prepared to travel to Europe in 1853, Gleason’s announced that he intended to present Wright’s medals of Webster and Clay to both Queen Victoria and Napoleon III."
9738,"Born Deerfield, New Hampshire    Benjamin F. Butler was a Massachusetts politician who, as a delegate at the Democratic presidential convention in the spring of 1860, voted for Jefferson Davis on the first fifty-seven ballots. A year later, at the start of the Civil War, Butler was one of the first to answer President Lincoln's call for troops to protect Washington. Appointed a major general of volunteers by a president desperate to find able officers, Butler proved to be largely inept at military command. Ultimately, General Grant requested Butler's removal late in the war, and Lincoln sent him back to his home in Massachusetts.    This photograph shows Butler as commander of the Army of the James and was likely taken when he was encamped south of Richmond in 1864. Butler had a crossed eye and always preferred to be photographed in profile."
9752,"Study for Grant and His Generals  As the Civil War moved into its final stages in the fall of 1864, the Norwegian artist Ole Peter Hansen Balling and a prosperous New Yorker conceived of the idea for a large equestrian painting depicting the commander of the Union armies, Ulysses S. Grant, flanked by an array of generals who served under him. Upon completion, the painting would be used to raise funds for the United States Sanitary Commission, a private organization for aiding sick and wounded soldiers. To obtain likenesses of the twenty-seven figures in the picture, Balling traveled to Union army encampments to make life studies of his subjects. Among the most cooperative was Grant, who gave Balling repeated opportunities to draw studies of him as he rode with staff officers to survey the forward lines near his headquarters at City Point, Virginia.  The final rendering of Grant and His Generals approached being life-sized. Balling also painted this smaller version, most likely to serve as the template for a color lithograph of the picture. Today both paintings are in the National Portrait Gallery’s collections; the large version is on display in the nearby stairwell.  Left to right: Thomas C. Devin (1822–1878), George A.

9786,"In the election held to pick the Boston area's representative to the first federal House of Representatives, Fisher Ames, a young country lawyer who advocated an effective national government, trounced the old Revolutionary Samuel Adams-a critic of the new Constitution-by a vote of 818 to 521. A cogent writer and a dazzling orator, Ames became a star in the emerging Federalist Party-supporting Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton's financial system, refuting James Madison's arguments against the establishment of a national bank, battling attempts to restrict commerce with England, and standing firm against Jeffersonian Republicans' partiality for revolutionary France. Chronic ill health forced Ames's retirement from Congress in 1797, but through his numerous essays he continued to champion the fundamental right of private property and to warn against the ""dangers to American liberty"" posed by unfiltered democracy.  "
9866,"Born Boston, Massachusetts    Benjamin Franklin, in his day the most famous American in the world, was renowned for his scientific accomplishments as much as for his political and diplomatic triumphs. Known as a ""natural philosopher,"" as scientists were termed in the eighteenth century, Franklin was celebrated for his experiments with electricity, but he also conducted experiments in other areas and invented devices as varied as a stove and bifocal eyeglasses. He also reorganized and expanded the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia and was often the conduit for correspondence between Americans and Europeans who were studying botany, chemistry, physics, and other sciences. By the mid-1780s, when this portrait was created, Franklin was representing the new republic in France, where he was revered for his wit and scientific knowledge. "
9939,"Elected to the White House after winning wide acclaim as the reforming governor of New Jersey, Woodrow Wilson left an impressive legacy of change that sought to curb abusive business practices and improve conditions for workers. But Wilson was not as successful in winning approval for his international idealism during World War I. Determined to make this conflict ""the war to end all wars,"" he sought at its end to create a world order that put peace ahead of national self-interest. America's European allies, however, undermined these hopes, insisting on a postwar peace settlement that contained the seeds of another war. A far worse disappointment for Wilson himself was his failure to persuade his own country to join the League of Nations, an organization he had conceived as the best hope for avoiding future wars. Having suffered a stroke while campaigning for American entry into the league, he left office in 1921, broken in both health and spirit.  "
9942,"Raised in New York and educated in the art of photography by Clarence White and Alfred Stieglitz, Karl Struss enjoyed critical success as a photographer before choosing to move to California in 1919 to start a second career in film. In addition to making publicity portraits of celebrities, he began working with director Cecil B. DeMille as a cinematographer. Struss served as the lead cameraman in many early silent films, including the epic drama Ben-Hur (1925). He was instrumental in establishing cinematography as a new field and during a career that lasted more than fifty years he worked on more than 140 movies. While Struss was largely focused on cinematography, he still devoted time to fine art photography in California, where he befriended Edward Weston, the creator of this 1923 platinum print. "
10039,"Born Farmville, Virginia      On April 26, 1865, General Joseph E. Johnston surrendered the Army of Tennessee, and all southern forces in his command, to General William T. Sherman near Durham, North Carolina. Johnston would always be grateful to Sherman for his generous terms of surrender. After the war, Johnston—a civilian for the first time since he entered West Point, where Robert E. Lee was a classmate—struggled to provide for himself and his wife, Lydia. He was briefly the president of a small railroad that went bankrupt before venturing into the insurance business in Savannah, Georgia. He published his memoirs in 1874 and was critical of many Confederate leaders, particularly his former nemesis, Jefferson Davis. Johnston moved to Richmond in 1877 and served a single term in the U.S. Congress. He caught a cold at William T. Sherman’s funeral in February of 1891 and died of pneumonia soon after. "
10051,"A leader of the postwar jazz revolution, Thelonious Monk—along with Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker—sparked the ""bebop"" movement, a jazz style more frenetic than the swing style that had held sway since the 1930s. Monk’s piano technique has been called eccentric: ""his melodies were angular, his harmonies full of jarring clusters."" His recording career took off in the mid-1950s, and he won an enthusiastic following, often playing with such other avant-garde musicians as John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins. His compositions ""’Round Midnight,"" ""Blue Monk,"" and ""Epistrophy"" are considered classics of modern jazz."
10072,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
10108,"  The elegant decorative features of this commercially produced stock poster are reminiscent of 1890s wallpaper designs of stylized floral motifs and geometric patterns. With ornamental lettering to add to the effect, the poster is designed to promote the elegance and stature of Ada Rehan, a leading lady of the American stage, in any of her acclaimed roles. Here, the specifics of the performance are crudely stamped at the top of the poster, referring to her appearance at the Harlem Opera House on April 18, 1898, in The Country Girl. By that time, Rehan, a principal with Augustin Daly's famous company for nearly twenty years, had a loyal following. Actor Otis Skinner had once described her performance as ""buoyant, scintillant, with a manner unlike other women, a voice that melted and caressed as it drawled, an awkward grace, an arch expression, a look of mischief in her gray Irish eyes."" "
10154,"Born Evansville, Indiana  Tapping on her toes and singing the songs of Irving Berlin, Marilyn Miller was launched to stardom in the 1918 Ziegfeld Follies. In 1920, she starred in Ziegfeld’s Sally and brought the house down night after night singing Jerome Kern’s “Look for the Silver Lining.”  Adored by musical comedy audiences, Miller had another great success in Kern and Oscar Hammerstein’s 1925 musical, Sunny. Her personality made the show a huge box-office hit, and her enchanting performance of “Who?” rendered that song a classic.   She was the highest-paid star on “the Great White Way,” and her contribution to dance—her fusion of ballet, tap, and clogging—made her Broadway’s darling through the mid-1920s."
10187,"General Wesley Merritt (seated, center) poses with his staff before the camera of Mathew Brady in this 1864 photograph. A highly competent cavalry officer, Merritt commanded the First Cavalry Division of General Philip Sheridan’s Army of the Shenandoah. His commendable performance at the Battle of Brandy Station, Virginia, in June 1863, in part led to his unprecedented leap in promotion from captain to brigadier general of volunteers."
10300,"A leader in the movement to enhance the standing of American art and artists, William Merritt Chase was both a critically acclaimed painter and a highly influential teacher. Chase was a versatile artist who secured his reputation through portraiture but also earned great admiration for his landscapes and still lifes. Known for his bravura brushwork, rich palette, and superb technique, he drew inspiration from many quarters, including European Old Masters, French impressionists, and Japanese prints. Although Chase's own work remained grounded in the nineteenth century, his students included many artists who would lay the foundations of American modernism, such as Georgia O'Keeffe, Marsden Hartley, and Edward Hopper.   As a young, aspiring artist, Edward Steichen sought the advice of Chase soon after arriving in New York in 1900. Steichen was gratified by the esteemed painter's warm response to his work, and the two became friends."
10369,"  Absorbing the lessons of European modernism, Stuart Davis embraced cubism, turning its formal vocabulary to American subjects. About the time this portrait was made, Davis started his Eggbeater series, cubist paintings inspired by the outline of an eggbeater. He later remarked, ""you may say everything I have done since has been based on that eggbeater idea."" In this drawing, a portrait either of himself or his brother Wyatt, Davis suppresses individual characteristics to create a flattened, iconic head. Davis built up the face from a combination of geometric spheres, cylinders, and polygons-the rectangle that became the nose is clearly visible-containing it all within a heavy contour line. As he polished the drawing, he adjusted the nose, gave a slight curve to the right angle of the shirt collar, and softened the form of the hat."
10375,"Born Scipio, New York    Regarded by his contemporaries as one of the nation's finest portraitists, Charles Loring Elliott painted more than seven hundred portraits representing many of mid-nineteenth-century America's most prominent businessmen, political leaders, and cultural figures. Elliott ""spoke enthusiastically of the Daguerreian art"" and strove to match the clarity and detail of photographic images in his paintings. Not surprisingly, he often employed daguerreotypes-including those from the studio of his friend Mathew Brady-as the sources for his portraits. A self-portrait that Elliott painted around 1850 bears a close resemblance to this Brady daguerreotype, which may have served as a study for that work."
10387,"The tired spot    It is impossible to look at this cast of Lincoln's face-gaunt and careworn-and not think that it is a death mask. In fact, it was taken from life on February 11, 1865, by sculptor Clark Mills. Life masks were very popular in the nineteenth century because they created a near-duplicate of the sitter's features. The plaster image complements the photographs taken of Lincoln by Alexander Gardner the same month. A friend of Lincoln's commented on the mask-and thus on the original-that it has ""a look as of one on whom sorrow and care had done their worst."" "
10413,"Claudia Taylor's African American nursemaid declared that she was as pretty as a ""ladybird,"" a nickname that stuck with her through her entire life. She graduated from high school at age fifteen and earned two degrees at the University of Texas: a B.A. in 1933 and a degree in journalism in 1934. That same year, Lady Bird met Lyndon Johnson, a young congressional secretary. After a brief courtship-best characterized by her statement that ""sometimes Lyndon simply takes your breath away""-they were married. Devoted to her husband's political career, she ran his office during World War II and in 1955, after he suffered a heart attack. The couple had two daughters. As first lady, Johnson was active in Head Start, and especially in her capital beautification project and in her promotion of the Highway Beautification Act."
10465,"Born Queens, New York     Casting Donald Trump as Icarus, who lost his wings while soaring too close to the sun, in a 1990 caricature for The Nation, Ed Sorel represents the real estate developer as his empire confronted financial crisis. Beneath the tumbling figure, beset by disintegrating wings made of currency, stands the Plaza Hotel, one of the numerous properties Trump controlled at the time. Yet the bravado that led Sorel to brand the seemingly overleveraged magnate as Icarus has also proved one of his strengths. Successfully negotiating a settlement, Trump declared in 1990: “This is a deal that will go down in the textbooks as the way banks and entrepreneurs should deal with each other.” His colorful and bold business persona later became the basis for his hit reality television show, The Apprentice. Not afraid to court controversy, Trump has continued to expand his holdings aggressively and has hinted at possible political ambitions. "
10522,"In 1925, having just completed a doctorate in anthropology, Margaret Mead embarked on a study of adolescence in Samoa's native culture. With few precedents to guide her, she had to chart her own methodology, and when her Coming of Age in Samoa was published three years later, it was widely praised for its pathbreaking contribution to its field. Yet this was only the beginning of a long string of achievements-including teaching, lecturing, and the writing of more than thirty books-that would ultimately make Mead one of the most respected intellectual commentators of her time. At her death, one tribute described her as ""an all-wise matriarch whose . . . common-sense opinions were sought by millions.""  Mead sat for this photograph in 1949, at about the time her book Male and Female: A Study of the Sexes in a Changing World was published. "
10682,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Anna E. Dickinson first displayed her social conscience publicly at the age of fourteen, when she contributed an antislavery article to William Lloyd Garrison’s newspaper, The Liberator. Four years later she delivered her first speech before the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society. Encouraged by Lucretia Mott and others, Dickinson began speaking regularly during the years of the Civil War on such issues as emancipation, hospital life, and Republican politics. Her youth and sex alone were enough to draw curious crowds of sometimes thousands to hear her “impassioned extempore delivery.” With the return to peace in 1865, Dickinson joined the lyceum lecture circuit. Some years she averaged 150 lectures and earned as much as $20,000. Her topics ranged from women’s rights to the evils of big business. In the 1870s, Dickinson became a playwright and an actor. "
10736,"As the historical cliché has it, the North won the Civil War, and the South won the peace, reestablishing its customs, folkways, and racial “etiquette” even with the demise of African American slavery. Allen Tate was a member of the literary “Agrarians,” a loose collection of southern writers who coalesced in the 1920s. They produced I’ll Take My Stand (1930), a sociological and literary argument against American modernity, mourning the world that was lost when the Old South disappeared. Tate was not naive enough to swallow the Lost Cause myth of southern moonlight and magnolias, but he was preoccupied, both poetically and politically, with the world that had been lost with the Confederacy’s defeat. "
10902,"Prior to leading his famous assault in 1859 on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, John Brown made national headlines for his abolitionist activities in Kansas and Missouri. Having worked as a tanner and later a wool merchant in the East, Brown decided in 1855 to travel to Kansas, where five of his sons had taken up homesteads. Pro-slavery ""border ruffians"" from Missouri increasingly threatened free-state supporters in Kansas, and the sons hoped their father would bring weapons to protect them. Following an attack on the town of Lawrence, Kansas, by pro-slavery forces, Brown joined a guerrilla band that ultimately killed five men in Pottawatomie County, an act that further escalated regional tensions and led to the burning of the town of Osawatomie by pro-slavery forces. These events served as a prelude to Brown's eventual plan to lead a mass slave uprising-a goal that fell short when he was captured and hung at Harpers Ferry."
10905,"Born Grand Chute, Wisconsin    On February 9, 1950, Joseph McCarthy, a previously obscure junior senator from Wisconsin, sensationally announced that he had a list of 205 Communist Party members who worked in the State Department with the full knowledge of Secretary of State Dean Acheson. It was the beginning of McCarthy's meteoric and demagogic campaign against ""reds"" in the government. In truth, McCarthy had no evidence, and as his charges grew wilder, even people who sympathized with his intentions, if not his methods, fell away. When McCarthy held hearings against the U.S. Army, the tide irrevocably turned: he was censured by the Senate in 1954 and died soon after. ""McCarthyism"" lives on as a catchphrase for the abuse of governmental authority and power, especially in areas of civil liberties. "
10964,"Scientist and educator George Washington Carver dedicated his career to improving the lives of impoverished southern farmers by encouraging the practice of scientific agriculture. Overcoming numerous barriers to secure a master's degree in agriculture in 1896, Carver accepted Booker T. Washington's invitation to lead the agricultural department at the Tuskegee Institute in rural Alabama. For the next forty-seven years, Carver poured his energy into research and educational efforts designed to improve farm productivity and foster self-sufficiency among African American farmers who were trapped in sharecropping dependency. Advocating crop diversification to restore soil exhausted by cotton, Carver encouraged the cultivation of soil-enriching peanuts and sweet potatoes. To demonstrate their commercial viability, he developed hundreds of new products solely from those crops. Carver's efforts transformed southern agriculture and earned him international recognition as the ""Genius of Tuskegee."""
11011,"Southern nationalism is symbolically infused in this engraving of General “Stonewall” Jackson seated with his wife, Anna, and their daughter, Julia. Prominently displayed on the back wall is a portrait of Robert E. Lee and sculpture busts of John C. Calhoun and George Washington. Lee emerged from the war as the South’s premier icon; he relied heavily on Jackson’s military prowess and leadership up until his lieutenant’s death in 1863. Calhoun was perhaps the South’s foremost pillar of states’ rights and the doctrine of secession, while Washington was held in the highest esteem by both sides as a revolutionary patriot and defender of the Constitution."
11051,"It’s very hard to see Sylvia Plath plain, as the photographer Rollie McKenna pictured her in 1959, midway between her graduation with much promise from Smith College (1955) and her suicide. Plath’s story is invested with an overload of emotion and meaning that gets in the way of the poetry itself. This photograph of Plath looking impossibly young was probably taken at Yaddo artists’ colony, where she and Ted Hughes summered in 1959 before returning to England after a year in America. At Yaddo, Plath wrote ""The Colossus,"" and by then she had drafted most of her novel, The Bell Jar. Plath performed a skillfully fraught balancing act that used her sense of self-alienation to both feminist and poetical effect. She achieved this by being ice-cold in her verse but superheated and self-absorbed in her subject matter. This coldness takes her poetry from personal melodrama and raises it to the universal level of tragedy. "
11058,"The Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty that Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev signed at the 1987 Washington summit eliminated an entire class of weapons from Europe and the Soviet Union. Observers who claimed the treaty was a reversal of Reagan’s hard-line Cold War stance failed to take into account his earlier statement that “strength and dialogue go hand and hand,” and that he would negotiate when the United States was in a strong position.                   In their first summit in 1985, Reagan bluntly told the Soviet leader, “we can disarm . . . but you can’t win the arms race. There is no way.” Convinced that the Soviets needed arms reduction because of their dysfunctional economy, Reagan predicted Gorbachev would accept an agreement on American terms, which the Soviet leader finally did in Washington. When asked if Gorbachev was an imposing negotiator, Reagan, who had negotiated difficult contracts with movie studio heads, quipped that he was not as tough as Jack Warner.    "
11074,"As Harper's Bazaar's editor-in-chief, Carmel Snow transformed the magazine from a faltering enterprise to a thriving pace-setter in fashion publishing. In the process, Snow herself became a major arbiter in women's fashion. The mere fact of her appearance at a dress-collection showing was enough to send a designer's spirits soaring, and she was widely credited with winning American women over to such French designers such as Dior and Balenciaga.  Under Snow's leadership, Harper's Bazaar developed a look that was the admiration of the entire magazine industry. A large part of that look was owing to the photographers she recruited. Chief among them was George Hoyningen-Huene, who made this likeness of her and was one of the most innovative fashion photographers of his time."
11099,"Belva Ann Lockwood flatly rejected the gallantry of those who sought to protect women from the more rigorous aspects of life. Denied the right to teach physical education to her female pupils, Lockwood protested until that privilege was granted. Barred later from utilizing a hard-won law degree in many courts, she lobbied for a congressional bill permitting women to argue before the Supreme Court and, on its passage in 1879, became the first woman admitted to practice in that tribunal. In 1884 Lockwood realized that although she could not vote, she could seek public office. By the late summer, before cheering supporters, she became the first woman to formally declare her candidacy for president. In this portrait, Lockwood appears in the robes presented to her in 1908 on receiving an honorary degree from her alma mater, Syracuse University.  "
11110,"On April 4, 1841, William Henry Harrison (1773-1841) became the first president to die in office. Just a month before, on a chilly, damp day, he had delivered an inaugural address lasting almost two hours. He caught a cold and developed pneumonia, from which he never recovered. Born into a prominent Virginia family and college-educated, Harrison was a former frontier general and Indian fighter. His historic ""log cabin and hard cider"" campaign was a hugely successful ploy adopted by the Whig Party to connect him to the common man, much as the Jacksonian Democrats had done more than a decade earlier.   Harrison's vice president, John Tyler, is absent from this deathbed scene. Tyler was viewed in a secondary light during the election campaign, in which ""Tippecanoe and Tyler too"" first became a political slogan and then an ironic twist of national fate. "
11142,"President Jimmy Carter's Cold War policy continued the détente initiated by his predecessors, but forcefully emphasized human rights. In his Time cover, caricaturist Edward Sorel points to the confusion and hard feelings caused by Carter's efforts to please both parties to a dispute, to achieve too much on too many fronts simultaneously, and to frame his foreign policy on moral principles for a world that generally did not welcome his preachings. For example, he wanted the Soviet Union to consider new arms limitation proposals, but he undercut these efforts by constantly criticizing that country for failure to protect human rights.   The ""lions"" hovering around Carter are (counterclockwise from top right): Soviet general secretary Leonid Brezhnev; Israeli premier Menachem Begin; Egyptian president Anwar Sadat; Chinese Communist Party chairman Hua Guofeng; and German chancellor Helmut Schmidt.  "
11343,"Born near Natchez, Mississippi     Varina Howell was a young woman of lively intellect and polished social graces who married Jefferson Davis when she was at the age of eighteen. As the wife of the president of the Confederacy, she lived in Richmond during the Civil War and admirably fulfilled her three primary roles as an affectionate spouse to a proud and sensitive husband, an attentive mother to five young children (two of whom were born during the war), and a socially engaging first lady."
11379,"In June 1862, during the Peninsula Campaign in Virginia, General Jeb Stuart led his Confederate cavalry on a raid around General George B. McClellan’s Army of the Potomac, cutting Union communication lines from the army’s large supply base near White House, Virginia, on the Pamunkey River. Stuart was able to disrupt Union operations while providing Robert E. Lee with valuable intelligence about enemy movements. The raid was a boost to southern morale after Confederate losses at New Orleans and Shiloh, Tennessee, in April. In this scene, Volck depicts Stuart’s troops plundering Yankee supplies.   Etching, 1863"
11396,"Lee disparaged Grant as a general, writing that he was a crude tactician who used the weight of numbers to overwhelm his opponent; Lee favored George McClellan as the superior commander. The Union’s bloody repulse at Cold Harbor (June 1, 1864), when Grant sent his men against a strongly entrenched Confederate line, taking approximately 5,000 casualties in about three hours to minimal rebel losses, is frequently cited in support of this commonly held view. The argument has an aesthetic quality: who could admire this bludgeoning against the elegance of Lee’s handling of his troops at Chancellorsville? Grant himself wrote, “I have always regretted that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.” Yet casualties at Cold Harbor were not significantly different than Pickett’s celebrated charge at Gettysburg. By grinding away at Lee, Grant, the supreme pragmatist, had stripped war of all its romance and false bravado.  Grant en Cold Harbor     Lee desacreditó a Grant como general al escribir que era un táctico ordinario que utilizaba el peso de los números para abrumar a su oponente; Lee prefería a George McClellan como comandante superior. El rechazo sangriento de la Unión en Cold Harbor (1 de junio, 1864), cuando Grant envió a sus hombres contra una línea fuertemente atrincherada de la Confederación, lo que dejó aproximadamente 5000 muertes en casi tres horas con pérdidas mínimas entre los rebeldes, es habitualmente mencionado como apoyo a esta visión comúnmente aceptada. El argumento tiene una característica estética: ¿quién puede admirar este aporreo comparado con la elegancia de Lee en el manejo de sus tropas en Chancellorsville? Grant mismo escribió:“siempre he lamentado que nunca se haya hecho el último ataque a Cold Harbor"". Sin embargo, las muertes en Cold Harbor no fueron significativamente diferentes de las de la célebre carga de Pickett en Gettysburg. Al destrozar a Lee, Grant, el supremo pragmático, le quitó a la guerra todo su romance y falsa bravuconería .     Mathew B.

11424,"Born upstate New York    The Mohawk chief Ho Nee Yeath Taw No Row was part of the delegation of Iroquois leaders who met with England’s Queen Anne in 1710. While in London, he and the other delegates were lavishly entertained and showered with gifts. In addition to presenting the group with a silver communion plate and other furnishings for a new chapel that missionaries were establishing in Mohawk territory, the queen also commissioned oil portraits of each of the delegates. The resulting paintings by John Verelst are believed to be the first full-length oil portraits of Native Americans. So popular were Ho Nee Yeath Taw No Row and his fellow ambassadors that printmaker John Simon created mezzotints after these paintings."
11474,"When Jimmy Doolittle was featured on this 1932 Shell Oil Company advertisement, his achievements as a Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained aeronautical engineer doing pioneer aviation research was eclipsed by his fame as a record-setting, trophy-winning stunt flyer about to compete in another race. The image is dated September 6, 1932, the day Doolittle won the one-hundred-mile Thompson Trophy race in Cleveland, and it also acknowledges another Shell flyer, Jimmy Haizlip, who had recently broken a transcontinental speed record. The poster, however, is designed to promote the Shell Oil Company and its products, not a specific event. The photographs of the two popular aviators are given a sense of immediacy in the context of a newspaper ""extra,"" tipped up slightly so that the small headline, ""All Major Events Won By Shell,"" is clearly legible."
11507,"This 1866 print by a Baltimore lithographer commemorated the occasion of Robert E. Lee's farewell address to the soldiers of the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, following its formal surrender on April 9, 1865, at Appomattox Court House.  "
11515,"Always concerned with painting from life and focused on the expressive potential of portraiture, Alice Neel had worked in relative obscurity until the 1960s, when she settled on the brightly colored, expressively distorted and linear painting style that she would develop for the rest of her life. During the summer of 1969, Neel traveled to Big Sur and spent several days visiting with and painting the double Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling and his wife, Ava Helen Miller Pauling, at their house on the Pacific coast. Pauling recalled that he “had little experience in posing for a painter, and . . . was interested in Alice Neel’s technique.” Neel may have been attracted to Pauling not only for his achievements in chemistry and molecular biology, but for his protests against nuclear testing and the excessive buildup of nuclear weapons, for which he had won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1962. "
11590,"Robert E. Lee was one of the best soldiers in the pre–Civil War army. He had an impeccable career at West Point and served with distinction in the Mexican American War. Lee was handsome and he could be charmingly sociable, although as he grew older he became more reserved; his sense of responsibility to his family may have sobered him, as did his religious awakening as an adult. And he had married into the family of George Washington, with all that that entailed in terms of the burden of the past. Lee served diligently in the U.S. Army; famously, when civil war came, he sided with Virginia over the nation. When he resigned from the army, his old mentor Winfield Scott told Lee, “I think you’ve made the greatest mistake of your life.”  Robert E. Lee     Robert E. Lee fue uno de los mejores soldados del ejército antes de la Guerra Civil. Tuvo una carrera impecable en West Point y sirvió con distinción en la guerra entre México y Estados Unidos. Lee era apuesto y podía ser sociable de modo encantador, aunque a medida que pasaban los años se volvía más reservado. Su sentido de la responsabilidad para con su familia lo pudo haber vuelto más serio, al igual que su despertar religioso en la edad adulta. Además, al casarse, había entrado a la familia de George Washington, con todo lo que ello implicaba en términos de la carga del pasado. Lee sirvió con diligencia en el ejército de los EE. UU. Como bien se sabe, cuando llegó la Guerra Civil, se puso de parte de Virginia y no de la nación. Cuando renunció al ejército, su antiguo mentor Winfield Scott le dijo: “Creo que has cometido el mayor error de tu vida”.      Charles G.

11621,"Portraiture became part of the mourning process that followed Abraham Lincoln's assassination on April 14, 1865. In the ensuing months, print publishers furnished the image of Lincoln in all guises: attended at his deathbed by various statesmen, sitting serenely with his family, or grouped with previous American heroes or presidents. But first, a shocked nation had to grapple with the facts of his assassination and death. The lithograph of the scene at Ford's Theatre re-creates the event, with John Wilkes Booth leaping to the stage after shooting Lincoln. The black-bordered Memento Mori recalls many Americans' first grieving response: to drape funereal bunting, crepe, and flags on doors and windows, often tucking a portrait into the decorations.  "
11631,"Edward Mitchell Bannister became one of the first African American painters to gain national recognition when his landscape Under the Oaks won a first prize at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia (1876). Almost entirely self-taught, Bannister began his career in the 1850s in Boston, where he enjoyed the patronage of that city's substantial black community. He was also a committed abolitionist who continued to advocate for African American rights after the Civil War. When Bannister settled in Providence, Rhode Island, in 1869, his reputation grew as his landscapes and coastal views were exhibited more widely. His name proved unfamiliar, however, to the Centennial Exposition judges, who tried to withhold his prize upon discovering that he was African American. When the other artists threatened to withdraw from the competition if Bannister was denied his medal, the original award was upheld."
11657,"The chance to become the Republican Party's nominee for vice president in 1880 was a welcome opportunity for Chester A. Arthur. ""This is a higher honor than I have ever dreamt of attaining,"" admitted Arthur. ""I shall accept!"" Arthur's nomination, as well as that of James A. Garfield, the presidential nominee, was part of a political compromise to unite a bitterly divided Republican Party. Arthur was from New York and was aligned with an entrenched political faction called the Stalwarts. Through their patronage, he won the lucrative and powerful appointment of collector of the Port of New York in 1871. When Arthur, a longtime practitioner of partisan politics, unexpectedly became president in 1881, he forsook his longtime political allegiances and rejected cronyism. "
11770,"The assembled justices of the Supreme Court in 1867 were (from left to right): David Davis (1815–1886), Noah Haynes Swayne (1804–1884), Robert Cooper Grier (1794–1870), James Moore Wayne (1790–1867), Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase (1808–1873), Samuel Nelson (1792–1873), Nathan Clifford (1803–1881), Samuel Freeman Miller (1816–1890), and Stephen Johnson Field (1816–1899). "
11775,"In 1927, a well-known novelist, Maurice Dekobra, together with Baker's manager, Pepito Abatino, wrote a screenplay for Baker. In La Sirène des Tropiques, whose ""tropical"" sets were filmed in the forest of Fontainebleu near Paris, Baker plays Papitou, a girl living in the Antilles who falls in love with a white man sent there by the father of the girl he proposed to marry. Papitou saves his life, and when he returns to Paris, she follows him. In Paris, Papitou is discovered and becomes a successful stage star. At the end of the film, she nobly steps away from her love so that he may marry his first chosen sweetheart, who is white. La Sirène des Tropiques includes several remarkable clips of Baker's dances, including one of her in the banana skirt. "
11824,"Born Kennett Square, Pennsylvania    Exotically posed here in Bedouin costume, Bayard Taylor, the son of a sober Philadelphia Quaker family, was the first great American travel writer. By the 1820s, as the nation settled and prospered, Americans turned outward, becoming travelers and tourists to both the Old World and the new territories in the Pacific. Encountering new vistas with the eyes of the young nation, individuals' travel accounts filled the newspapers as Americans became avid consumers of news from elsewhere. Taylor was among the most peripatetic of these writer-journalists and was unusual because he wrote many of his travelogues in verse, a style that only added to his romantic allure. In 1853 he joined Commodore Matthew C. Perry in his mission to Japan and recorded his adventures in Poems of the Orient (1854), which included his most famous work, ""The Bedouin's Song."""
11848,"Over his long, calculated, and prize-winning career as America’s best-loved poet, Robert Frost became the epitome of the New England Yankee: a weathered, craggy, flinty, and plainspoken countryman who turned ordinary life into poetry. Ironies abound. He was born in San Francisco and named after Robert E. Lee. Stereotyped as a regionalist, Frost received a major boost from the rootless modernist Ezra Pound. Uniquely American, Frost’s first two books were assembled and published in England before appearing in his homeland. Seemingly artless, because it is about artless subjects, Frost’s verse was a complicated formalist response to modernism—and to democracy. Frost did the most difficult thing: he made the complex weave of his poems appear easy or natural, leading to their persistent underestimation. Seemingly straightforward and reverential, his poems are sly, subversive. There was no less-traveled road in ""The Road Not Taken""; both paths are equally unworn, and the choice is false—or more terrifyingly, meaningless. As the years advanced, the Yankee persona won more often than not, and he tapped into a complacent, conservative populism, one that was not as benign or as avuncular as his audience sometimes assumed. Recovering that ""lost past’s / detail"" was Frost’s original task, one that cropped like granite through his most powerful work."
11864,"   Born in the Netherlands  In addition to mothering fourteen children, Anne Green helped her husband, Jonas, run the Maryland Gazette. When he died in 1767, she took over as manager of his printing shop and as the newspaper’s editor. Under her supervision, the enterprise thrived, and she gained a favorable reputation for recording opinions and events leading up to the American Revolution. During this period, she was also appointed the official printer of documents for the colony of Maryland. One of a small number of women printers during the colonial period, she ran the newspaper for eight years.  In this portrait, among the first that Charles Willson Peale painted after returning from London in 1769, Peale represents Green not as her obituary recorded, a mother and wife of ""a mild and benevolent Disposition . . . an Example of her Sex."" Instead, he portrayed her as a professional printer with a copy of the Maryland Gazette, which announced Peale’s return and included a notice about his portrait of William Pitt. "
11873,"Zora Neale Hurston was a writer and anthropologist whose novels and essays revealed the vital ethnic culture of southern African Americans. Raised in the all-black town of Eatonville, Florida, Hurston moved to New York City to study with Franz Boas and became a striking, stylish figure of the Harlem Renaissance. A charismatic raconteur, Hurston was brutally honest in writing and in person. In Mules and Men (1935), she captured the rich voices and mythos of the African American oral storytelling tradition. In Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), her heroine learns independence the hard way and concisely captures the modernist ethos of the self: ""You gotta go there to know there."" In her essays Hurston analyzed the aesthetics of spirituals, sermon s, juke joints, and African American vernacular English. Alice Walker’s rediscovery of Hurston in the early 1980s—after four decades of neglect—remains one of the great comeback stories in American literary history."
11896,"Francis Rose painted Stein and Toklas in their new space, using the iconography of a happy family. Toklas works on a tapestry frame, perhaps on a design by Picasso or Rose himself; Stein writes at her desk; and their dog Pépé snoozes on the horsehair couch. Paintings by Picasso hang in, around, and sometimes on top of the decorative plaster relief work on the walls."
11915,"To Gordon Parks, the camera was ""a weapon against poverty, against racism, against all sorts of social wrongs."" The youngest of fifteen children and a high school dropout, Parks was a pioneer in the world of photography and filmmaking. In 1948, he became the first African American photographer to be hired at Life, the largest circulation magazine of its day. For more than two decades he created compelling images that addressed the important issues of the moment, including the civil rights movement. During this period, he also photographed celebrities and fashion models for Vogue and Glamour. Beginning in the late 1960s, Parks added filmmaking to his list of creative pursuits, and his 1971 hit movie Shaft is regarded as an important prototype in the ""blaxploitation"" genre. Arnold Eagle pictures Parks at work on a documentary project for Standard Oil."
11926,"Seven Ages of Man  The Meade Brothers exhibited numerous examples of their work at the ""Great Exhibition"" held in New York City’s Crystal Palace (1853–54), including a series of daguerreotypes by Charles Meade illustrating Shakespeare’s ""seven ages,"" as described in Act II of As You Like It. Lauded by the Photographic Art Journal for reflecting ""much talent"" and ""a high degree of cultivated taste,"" the Meade Brothers’ Seven Ages of Man—Infant, Schoolboy, Lover, Soldier, Justice, Pantaloon, and Second Childishness—later circulated in the form of card-mounted photographs known as cartes de visite."

11993,"Theodore Roosevelt was one of the most portrayed persons of his era. From the beginning of his career as a New York assemblyman in the early 1880s to his death in 1919, Roosevelt stayed almost perpetually in the public eye. Photographer Alvin Langdon recorded him in this image taken at the White House on April 1, 1907. Only twenty-four, Coburn was already realizing some of the most productive years of his career. Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw, another subject of Coburn's camera, called him ""the greatest photographer in the world,"" high praise that must have rankled other greats such as Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen. Still, there was no denying the vibrancy of Coburn's portraiture, the best of which he compiled in a book, Men of Mark (1913). This image of Roosevelt was included among the book's thirty-three prints of American and European authors, artists, and statesmen."
12018,"Kennedy speaking in Wisconsin during the Democratic primary race    In 1960 John Kennedy's only way to the presidential nomination was by winning primaries, convincing the party's bosses of his electoral strength. The first test was in Wisconsin, on April 5, where Kennedy faced Hubert Humphrey from neighboring Minnesota. Kennedy won, but not by the margin predicted. When asked by one of his sisters what it meant, he responded bitterly, ""we have to do it all over again . . . win every one of them-West Virginia . . . Maryland . . . Indiana, and Oregon."" Humphrey viewed his close finish as a ""moral victory"" and readied himself for West Virginia. Democratic leaders, however, saw Humphrey's inability to win in a neighboring state as fatal. Ironically, it was Humphrey's decision to enter the West Virginia primary, and Kennedy's decisive victory over him there, that convinced ""the big Eastern bosses,"" in reporter Theodore White's view, to support Kennedy, ensuring him the nomination. "
12138,"Born Reading, Pennsylvania    The novel historically has its roots in the city. But the astonishingly prolific John Updike showed how it could also examine the morals and manners of suburban America. In his five-part series whose central character is ""Rabbit"" Angstrom, Updike chronicled middle-class America's postwar history in comic and heartbreaking fashion. Updike also wrote three novels about a moderately successful Jewish novelist called Henry Bech, who implausibly wins the Nobel Prize; curiously, the Nobel is one prize that Updike did not win. Updike once said his goal was to publish a book a year, and he came close with his novels and many collections of short stories, poetry, and nonfiction. That ubiquity landed him on the cover of Time magazine in 1982. The cover artist was Alex Katz, whose oversized flattened forms, detached expressions, and emphatic patterning had been reinvigorating portrait traditions since the 1960s."
12155,"Thomas Hart Benton was a major political figure in the antebellum period, serving as a Democratic senator from Missouri for thirty years. Politically, Benton helped implement ""manifest destiny""  with his wholehearted support of national expansion. He wrote in 1818: ""In a few years the Rocky Mountains will be passed and the 'children of Adam' will have . . . [marched] west to . . . the Pacific."" To fulfill this vision of America as a new Eden, Benton promoted homesteading, the western railroad, the Pony Express, annexation, and other measures. But his career foundered on the issue of slavery. A believer in the Union and an opponent of slavery, he voted against the Compromise of 1850, which deferred conflict on the slavery issue. Benton's intransigence outraged the Missouri legislature, and they replaced him with a pro-slavery Whig in 1850.  "
12262,"   Born Shadwell (now Albemarle County) Virginia   In 1780, Thomas Jefferson, governor of Virginia, received queries from the Marquis de Barbé, secretary of the French Legation, seeking information about the state. Jefferson, an inveterate observer of all phenomena, organized his notes and sent an elaborate response focusing on Virginia’s natural history—its minerals, vegetables, and animals. He was eager to refute the French naturalists, specifically the Comte de Buffon, who believed that animals degenerated in America. Jefferson sent out inquiries, requesting the heaviest weights of American specimens, ""from the mouse to the mammoth."" When he received numerous requests for copies of his response, Jefferson decided to print the work, but did not publish it until 1785, when he was minister to France. Notes on the State of Virginia, Jefferson’s only published book, became famous not only because of its author, but because, as his biographer Dumas Malone noted, it revealed a ""man of most unusual and diverse talent.""   The young American artist Mather Brown produced this first likeness of Jefferson in Paris."
12308,"Born Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  Gene Kelly became a Broadway star in Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart’s Pal Joey (1940) but is best known for such legendary movie musicals as On the Town, An American in Paris, and Singin’ in the Rain.  One of the screen’s “most inventive and effervescent” musicals, On the Town radiates with Kelly’s dynamic choreography. “I realized,” he explained, “that there was no character—whether a sailor or a truck driver or a gangster—that couldn’t be interpreted through dancing.”   An American in Paris won six Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Singin’ in the Rain is often ranked the most popular of all movie musicals, and was one of the first films selected for the Library of Congress’ National Film Registry.  Kelly saw himself as a basic song-and-dance man who enjoyed making people smile “by running over a couple of couches or through a rainstorm.”"
12315,"In the late winter of 1985, the cover of Time magazine featured this double portrait of basketball star Larry Bird and hockey great Wayne Gretzky. The image ran with the headline ""Simply the Best,"" and in the accompanying article, the magazine described the pair as athletes whose excellence had ""transcended the competition."" The praise was certainly well deserved. During twenty-one years of professional play, Gretzky recorded more goals, assists, and total points than any hockey player in history and was named to the All-Star team eighteen times. As for Bird, his achievements with the Boston Celtics included three Most Valuable Player awards, appearances in twelve All-Star games, and a points-scored record that placed him among the leading scorers of all time. Through the brilliance of their play, Bird and Gretzky both dominated and defined their respective sports for a generation of fans."
12316,"In the early 1960s, George H. W. Bush presided over a thriving oil business in Houston, Texas, but then he turned to politics. By 1980, when he was elected Ronald Reagan's vice president, he had served as ambassador to the United Nations, envoy to China, and director of the Central Intelligence Agency. In 1988, he won the presidency.  Bush proved sure-footed in foreign policy, where, according to one observer, he proved a master of both ""timing and substance."" More widely traveled than any other president, he managed the policy transitions prompted by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War. Perhaps his greatest success was the alliance he crafted to thwart Iraq's forceful takeover of Kuwait in 1990.  Bush sat for this portrait at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine. The picture's backdrop, however, is the East Room of the White House. Among artist Ron Sherr's aims was to balance the formality of the composition with a warmth capable of drawing the viewer into the picture.  "
12339,"Born Denison, Texas     With a talent for military strategy and the ability to work effectively with personalities of all types, General Dwight D. Eisenhower proved uniquely suited for the role of supreme allied commander during World War II. A career army officer, Eisenhower began his wartime service in 1941 as head of the War Plans Division under General George C. Marshall. He was assigned to lead U. S. forces in Britain in the spring of 1942, and later commanded the Allied forces’ invasions of North Africa, Sicily, and Italy (1942–43). Named supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force by President Franklin Roosevelt in December 1943, Eisenhower masterminded the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, and directed Allied operations in Europe until the surrender of Germany in May 1945. Enormously popular with the American public after the war, Eisenhower was elected to the presidency in 1952 and served two terms."
12355,"Born Great Barrington, Massachusetts    Sociologist and historian W.E.B. Du Bois originated the policies-legal suits, legislative lobbying, and public protest-that characterized the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s. In the early 1900s, he organized protests against the increasing racial violence that spread from the South into northern cities. Breaking ranks with Booker T. Washington and his policies of accommodation and gradualism, Du Bois called for immediate civil and political rights for African Americans. He founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1910 and became editor of its monthly magazine, The Crisis. Du Bois's disillusionment after World War I attracted him to Marxism and led him to question the efficacy of legal and political tactics to end racism. He eventually became a citizen of Ghana. Du Bois was the author of such classic works as The Souls of Black Folk (1903) and Black Reconstruction in America (1935)."
12382,"D. W. Griffith, the son of a Kentucky slave owner, became one of the silent-screen era's most influential directors. He is best remembered for his epic Birth of a Nation, which depicted the South after the Civil War as terrorized by carpetbaggers and freed slaves, with the Ku Klux Klan as the savior of southern honor. The film's racist themes mirrored the appalling reality of race relations in 1915. But its technical virtuosity and epic quality, combined with an intensely personal narrative of individuals caught up in historic events, made it a remarkable cinematic achievement. While not an innovator, Griffith enhanced many of the era's new film techniques. By integrating those techniques within powerful spectacle and narrative, he brought the cinema to new heights, elevating it to an art form and making him ""the father of the motion picture.""  "
12383,"Anna Held c. 1877–1918   Born Warsaw, Poland  Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. 1867–1932   Born Chicago, Illinois  Master showman Florenz Ziegfeld Jr. brought a razzle-dazzle to live performance that signaled a new era of mass entertainment at the turn of the twentieth century. Glittering grand-scale extravaganzas, the Ziegfeld Follies “glorified the American girl” with glamour, glitz, and elegance.  The Follies featured statuesque showgirls swathed in feathers and sequins, the greatest vaudeville stars of the era, and the music of such new American composers as Irving Berlin.  Ziegfeld wooed Folies Bergère star Anna Held to New York City and, beginning in 1907, starred her in his lavish revues. He flooded newspapers with her photographs and with titillating stories about her daily milk baths.   Ziegfeld called his shows “spectacles,” and their enormous success made him the towering impresario of a uniquely American style of entertainment."
12391,"On August 13, 1934, the first Li’l Abner comic strip appeared in eight North American newspapers. Its twenty-four-year-old creator, Al Capp, had a vision of creating a droll hillbilly world, ""the uncertain hamlet of Dogpatch,"" inhabited by a gullible cast of far-fetched characters who always managed to outdo one another in duplicity and inanity. Depression-era readers loved the farce and could almost daily relate to some character whose life situation was far worse than their own. Time reported in 1950 that ""after 14 years of drawing Li’l Abner, Capp makes $300,000 a year, [and] is read by 38 million fans in 700 U.S. newspapers.""  For this cover, Chaliapin portrayed Capp smiling impishly as two of his original lead characters, Li’l Abner and Daisy Mae, pull at his ears. The ""Shmoo"" in each bubble is a Capp creature who could do anything for anybody, from laying an egg to transporting characters elsewhere."
12410,"Born St. Paul, Minnesota    The emergence of the modern feminist movement in the 1960s had initially seemed but a sidelight to the massive demonstrations for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. Yet it was clear that the growing cry for equal opportunity for women could not be ignored. In no small measure, the movement owed its quickening pulse to Kate Millett, whose 1970 book Sexual Politics had become something of a bible for feminism. When Time magazine sought a personification of feminist protest for its cover in August 1970, it, not surprisingly, settled on Millett. Unfortunately, Millett herself was not pleased with the choice, feeling that no one person could presume to embody the aspirations of her cause. As a result, when Alice Neel asked her to pose, she refused. Instead, Neel used photographs to make this likeness."
12504,"Singer and actress Lena Horne helped break the color barrier in mainstream popular culture in the mid-twentieth century, beginning her stage career in the chorus at Harlem's Cotton Club in 1933, where Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway mentored her. In 1942 Hollywood beckoned, but her roles were often musical cameos that southern theaters could cut; Horne once said that Stormy Weather and Cabin in the Sky were the only films ""in which I played a character who was involved in the plot."" She became Hollywood's highest-paid African American actor, and her renditions of ""Stormy Weather"" and ""Just One of Those Things"" were considered classics. During this time, Horne also became a vocal spokesperson for civil rights. She also continued to enjoy a successful nightclub and recording career, and triumphed in the 1980s with her one-woman show, Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music."
12509,"One of the tasks of early American science was to discover and catalog the flora and fauna of this uncharted land. Working diligently to make the natural world wholly known, artist-naturalists such as George Ord, Alexander Wilson, and the Peale family created faithful renditions of America's birds and animals. The flamboyant John James Audubon, son of a Frenchman and his Creole mistress, revolutionized this dry academic field by creating images of birds with all the color and bravura style of the Romantic period. Audubon frequently got the science wrong-he feuded continually with the earlier generation of ornithologists-but the aesthetic achievement of his Birds of America (1827) cannot be denied. Audubon was a major contributor to the Romantic interpretation of the American landscape by both writers and artists, which took place after about 1820."
12516,"Thomas Paine was often viewed as slovenly and unwashed, but Samuel Collings's image of the man in London during the early 1790s fits contrary descriptions. ""In his dress and person he was generally very cleanly,"" wrote Paine's close friend Clio Rickman. He ""wore his hair cued, with side curls, and powdered, so that he looked altogether like a gentleman of the old French school."" "
12540,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
12577,"Martin Luther King Jr., the foremost leader in America’s mid-twentieth-century civil rights movement, was Time’s Man of the Year for 1963, in recognition of the magnitude of his accomplishments that year. He had spearheaded peaceful protests from Birmingham, Alabama, to Washington, D.C., the climax of which was the grand March for Jobs and Freedom on August 28. In large part because of King’s compelling activism, Congress would soon pass historic and unprecedented legislation mandating racial equality for all.   Time selected Robert Vickrey to paint King’s cover likeness. When King learned that the artist wished to have life sittings, Vickery had to fly to King’s home in Atlanta, Georgia, twice before he could arrive at an image that was satisfactory to both the magazine and King.   Martin Luther King Jr.  1929–1968     Martin Luther King Jr., el líder más importante del movimiento pro derechos civiles de mediados del siglo XX en Estados Unidos, fue seleccionado Hombre del Año 1963 por Time en reconocimiento de sus magníficos logros durante aquel año. King había encabezado protestas pacíficas desde Birmingham, Alabama, hasta Washington, D.C., coronadas con la gran Marcha por el Trabajo y la Libertad el 28 de agosto. Gracias en gran medida al activismo ardiente y persuasivo de King, el Congreso pronto haría historia al probar una ley sin precedentes que proclamaba la igualdad racial para todos.               Time seleccionó a Robert Vickrey para pintar la imagen de King que aparecería en portada. Sabiendo que el artista quería que posara para él, King hizo que Vickrey viajara dos veces hasta su casa en Atlanta, Georgia, antes de lograr una imagen que resultara satisfactoria para la revista y para el propio King.

12578,"One of baseball's great sluggers and larger-than-life personalities, Reggie Jackson hit 563 career home runs and helped carry his teams to four World Series championships from 1973 to 1978. While Jackson's regular season play was far from average, his postseason performances were spectacular. In his 1973 World Series debut, Jackson was a key factor in the Oakland A's victory over the New York Mets, producing five extra-base hits and driving in six runs to collect MVP honors for the series. But Jackson's exploits in the 1977 World Series proved even more remarkable. Playing this time for the Yankees, he belted three consecutive homers off three Dodgers pitchers in the deciding game of the series to propel New York to its first world championship in fifteen years. Jackson's heroics earned him the moniker ""Mr. October""-a fitting tribute to his postseason brilliance."
12590,"In 1909 Theodore Roosevelt’s hand-picked candidate, William Howard Taft, succeeded him to the presidency. Taft, who regarded Roosevelt as his closest friend, was determined to carry on the former president’s policies. In a letter to Roosevelt after his inauguration and just before Roosevelt began his journey to East Africa, Taft wrote, ""My dear Theodore: If I followed my impulse, I should say ""My dear Mr. President."" I cannot overcome the habit. . . . I want you to know that I do nothing in the Executive Office without considering what you would do under the same circumstances."""
12598,"Born near Easton, Maryland     At the close of the Civil War, Frederick Douglass continued to fight for the rights of blacks and women; both causes had made him the most prominent black leader of his generation. And his continued affiliation with the Republican Party of the late Abraham Lincoln won him such political appointments as delegate to Santo Domingo in 1871, marshal of the District of Columbia in 1877, recorder of deeds for the district in 1881, and minister to Haiti in 1889. A year and a half after the death of his first wife, Anna, Douglass married Helen Pitts in 1884. The marriage was controversial because Helen was white and nearly twenty years younger. Douglass countered the racial criticism by pointing out that Helen was merely the color of his father."
12616,"Born Florida, Missouri    ""His fame is imperishable,"" wrote the New York Times at the time of Samuel Clemens's death one hundred years ago this April. Using the pen name Mark Twain, Clemens had become one of this country's favorite satiric writers by the early 1870s, routinely making light of everyday human foibles. But it was the publication of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) that assured him a lasting place in American letters. Inspired in part by his own boyhood, these two tales set along the Mississippi River did more than capture the rhythms of youth in antebellum America. In these and other novels, Clemens examined with sardonic wit different tensions that underlay contemporary society, including the question of race. In later years, his success in this country and abroad was tempered by financial and personal setbacks and by a contempt for American and British imperialism."
12624,"If Ezra Pound was America's most original and influential modern poet, he was also its most controversial. Living primarily in Europe, the prodigiously energetic Pound promoted innovation as a critic and editor, serving as friend and adviser to such writers as T. S. Eliot, William Carlos Williams, James Joyce, and Ernest Hemingway, as well as to photographer Alvin Langdon Coburn. By the 1920s, Pound's experimental verse and critical essays helped revolutionize western poetry. His most ambitious work was the Cantos, an epic series of lyrical poems that he began to publish in the 1920s and on which he labored all his life. Pound's virulent anti-Semitism, support of fascism, and mental instability ultimately clouded his reputation. But Coburn, who photographed Pound in London for his 1913 book Men of Mark, portrayed the passionate intellectual who inspired and influenced so many.  "
12644,"Reagan, a union leader in Hollywood, won the endorsement of the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization (PATCO) during his 1980 campaign. Confident of Reagan’s support, PATCO demanded improvements in working conditions during the summer of 1981. When negotiations failed, controllers left their posts, ignoring Reagan’s warning that strikes were illegal for federal workers. Many were unaware that Reagan’s hero, Calvin Coolidge, fired striking Boston police while governor of Massachusetts. A grim and determined Reagan announced the controllers would be terminated if they did not return in forty-eight hours, an assertion that PATCO did not believe. On August 3, 1981, however, Reagan fired the nation’s striking air traffic controllers—approximately 11,500—bringing in military controllers with minimal disruption. For many observers in the United States and the Soviet Union, Reagan’s decisiveness in this episode demonstrated an inner strength beneath his warm manner and cheerful smile.    "
12705,"John Dickinson's Letters from a Farmer in Pennsylvania were published in nineteen of the twenty-three colonial newspapers, and his reasoned case against British taxation made him the first of America's celebrated patriots. The most cautious of men (he would hold back from signing the Declaration of Independence), Dickinson was no rabble-rouser, saying ""the cause of liberty is a cause of too much dignity to be sullied by turbulence and tumult.""  "
12708,"Jackson Pollock was an explosive force in American art circles at midcentury. Rejecting the conservative realism of his mentor, Thomas Hart Benton, Pollock developed a painting style centered on spontaneity and accident. Rather than working from an easel, he laid his canvases on the studio floor and used a variety of nontraditional tools, including sticks and trowels, to create swirling patterns of expressive marks. Inspired by Jungian psychology and surrealism, he sought an art that flowed with great immediacy from his unconscious. From the time of his first solo exhibition in 1943 to his death in a car accident in 1956, Pollock was the most talked about and controversial artist of the period. His hard drinking, reckless behavior, and brooding manner only added to the public’s fascination. Arnold Newman’s photograph was part of a series taken in the artist’s Long Island studio in 1949 on commission for Life magazine. "
12796,"In rallying to the cry of ""Tippecanoe and Tyler, too"" in 1840, voters had their eyes fixed on the Whig Party's White House contender referred to in the first half of that catchy slogan-William Henry Harrison, hero of the Battle of Tippecanoe. For most, his vice-presidential running mate, John Tyler, represented merely an afterthought. Within a month of his inauguration, however, Harrison was dead, and Tyler became the first vice president to be made president upon the death of his predecessor.  Tyler claimed the full powers of the presidency on taking office and thereby set a valuable precedent for future vice presidents who faced his situation. But Tyler's White House tenure was tempestuous. When his belief in the limited powers of federal government led him to veto his fellow Whigs' measure for reestablishing a national bank, he found himself deserted by his cabinet, formally read out of his party, and branded ""His Accidency"" by former allies.  "
12815,"Union general Winfield Scott Hancock (1824–1886) commanded the Second Corps of the Army of the Potomac. He won praise from soldiers and peers alike for his bravery and leadership at Gettysburg (1863), where he was seriously wounded, and in the Virginia battles of the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Cold Harbor (1864). At Gettysburg, Hancock’s command repulsed the brunt of Pickett’s charge. In response to a subordinate who urged Hancock not to ride his horse in the midst of the fight, he replied, ""There are times when a corps commander’s life does not count.""  In this photograph of Hancock’s camp headquarters, possibly near Cold Harbor in June 1864, Hancock is shown in the center, resting his hand on a tree. His division commanders—Francis C. Barlow (leaning against the tree) and David Bell Birney and John Gibbon (left front)—stand near him.  A woodcut illustration of this photograph, appeared in Harper’s Weekly on August 13, 1864."
12902,"As the war went badly for the Union in 1862, northern public opinion supported the confiscation of slaves in captured territory in order to damage the war effort and strike at the southern home front. Lincoln took confiscation further: on July 22 he announced an ""Emancipation Proclamation"" to his cabinet that concluded by declaring that all ""persons held as slaves"" in areas of rebellion ""shall then, thenceforward, and forever, be free.""  At a stroke, Lincoln coupled the preservation of the Union, his initial goal, with the abolition of slavery, an issue that he had approached warily and cautiously. His cabinet was divided, many feeling that it was a desperate measure ""of an exhausted government, . . . our last shriek, on the retreat."" Lincoln was adamant, and he acceded only to the suggestion that implementing the proclamation wait for a Union victory."
12919,"Bessie Smith was the most influential blues singer in history and the first major feminist voice in American music. With her deep, powerful contralto, Smith foregrounded an individual woman’s experience in her songs: she sang alternately with lusty pride and melancholy of sexual desire, economic hardship, loneliness, and transience. She drank and fought as hard as any man, ran her own vaudeville troupe, and once scared off a bunch of Klansmen by herself. During the Jim Crow era, Smith’s songs mediated the experience of the Great Migration out of the South and evoked intense emotional response from black audiences. A protégé of Ma Rainey, Smith sang of the road as a metaphor for life: ""I’m a rambling woman . . . with a rambling mind."" Her artistic influence remains vital in artists such as Bonnie Raitt, Erykah Badu, and Lucinda Williams. Janis Joplin put up half the money for Smith’s new gravestone in 1970."
12954,"Advocating nonviolence ""not just as a technique, but as a way of life,"" activist John Lewis endured repeated beatings and arrests while spearheading civil rights protests during the 1960s. A founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) when he was just nineteen, Lewis took the lead in organizing the freedom rides, sit-ins, marches, and other demonstrations that were part of SNCC's drive to end racial segregation and secure voting rights for millions of disenfranchised African Americans. In the summer of 1962, he initiated a direct- action campaign challenging the rigid segregation that prevailed in the community of Cairo, Illinois. As Lewis (far left) and other demonstrators knelt in prayer during a vigil outside the city's ""whites only"" swimming pool, photographer Danny Lyon captured this compelling image. Issued by SNCC as a fundraising poster, it carried the caption, ""Come let us build a new world together.""  "
12962,"One of the first great American architects, Robert Mills counted among his buildings the one you are now standing in, constructed to house the Patent Office. Born in South Carolina, Mills was trained in Philadelphia by Benjamin Henry Latrobe and soon established a thriving practice in cities on the East Coast, especially Philadelphia, Charleston, and Washington. He married Eliza Barnwell Smith in 1808. By 1851 he was serving as the federal government’s de facto architect of federal buildings.  Jesse H. Whitehurst was one of the South’s most successful daguerreotypists, opening his first gallery in Norfolk, Virginia, in 1843."
13020,"Daniel Shays, a Revolutionary War captain, gave his name to the 1786-87 tax rebellion in western and central Massachusetts. Armed farmers, threatened with the loss of their farms and imprisonment for debt, forced the closing of the courts and marched upon the arsenal at Springfield. The militia was called out, the insurrection at length put down, most of the rebels pardoned (Shays fled to Vermont), and their grievances addressed by the state legislature. Most significantly, Shays's Rebellion frightened conservatives throughout the country and gave an urgency to the need for a stronger central government. "
13045,"Born Taishan, Guangdong, China  James Wong Howe was one of Hollywood’s preeminent cinematographers; his filmography spans from 1923 to 1975. He began at the Lasky studios during the silent era, working as an assistant on Cecil B. DeMille’s early features. By the time ""talkies"" arrived, Howe was in demand, having established his reputation for, as he once said, making ""old stars young, plump stars thin, ordinary faces beautiful."" Howe was known for his technical innovations, such as using black-velvet camera hoods ""to make blue eyes show up better on the orthochromatic film stock in use until the early 1920s."" Among his noted films were The Thin Man (1934), The Prisoner of Zenda (1937), Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), and The Old Man and the Sea (1958). Nominated for ten Academy Awards, Howe won two Oscars, for The Rose Tattoo (1956) and Hud (1963)."
13187,"Richard Nixon owed his election as Dwight Eisenhower's vice president to his early reputation as an anti-Communist. By the time he became president in 1968, however, his thinking had shifted considerably. As a result, under his leadership, the confrontational strategies that had long dominated this country's response to Communism gave way to a historic détente, marked by American recognition of Communist China and better relations with the Soviet Union.  These achievements, however, were eventually overshadowed by disclosure of the Watergate scandals-a web of illegal activity involving scores of Nixon's advisers. Although never implicated in the original crimes, Nixon did become party to attempts to cover them up. Following irrefutable disclosure of that fact, he became the only president ever to resign from office.  Artist Norman Rockwell admitted that he had intentionally flattered Nixon in this portrait. Nixon's appearance was troublesomely elusive, Rockwell noted, and if he was going to err in his portrayal, he wanted it to be in a direction that would please the subject."
13345,"In 1972, Alabama governor George C. Wallace would come to know violence personally when he was crippled by an assassin’s bullet in Laurel, Maryland, while campaigning for the Democratic Party presidential nomination. Yet it was a horrific act of violence that occurred nine years earlier in Birmingham, Alabama, that prompted Time’s editors to put him on the cover in late September 1963. On Sunday morning, September 15, a bomb planted by white supremacists tore through the city’s largest African American church, killing four teenaged Sunday-school students. Wallace had recently won the governorship on an anti-desegregation platform and proved to be popular among whites. He was elected several more times until he finally left office in a wheelchair in 1979.  Chaliapin based this on an actual window in the church, in which Christ’s face had been obliterated by the bombing."
13419,"The earliest known likeness of radical abolitionist John Brown, this portrait was made by pioneering African American daguerreotypist and fellow abolitionist Augustus Washington. In a pose that dramatizes his antislavery activism, Brown stands with one hand raised as if repeating his public pledge to dedicate his life to the destruction of slavery. With his other hand, he grasps what is believed to be the standard of his ""Subterranean Pass Way""-the militant alternative to the Underground Railroad that Brown sought to establish in the Allegheny Mountains more than a decade before his ill-fated raid on the arsenal at Harpers Ferry.  "
13441,"The American belief in reform and progress at the beginning of the twentieth century received a severe blow with the outbreak of war in Europe in 1914. Many had taken it as an article of faith that nations no longer had to resort to war to solve differences, even though Germany had been perceived as a threat to democratic nations by President Woodrow Wilson and others for years. Wilson clung to the principle of American neutrality, but he was obligated to protect American maritime and commercial interests, which, as the war progressed, were being interfered with by both Germany and Great Britain. Germany's decision to begin unrestricted submarine warfare in February 1917, in retaliation for the British naval blockade, forced Wilson's hand. On April 2, 1917, he proclaimed that the ""world must be made safe for democracy,"" and days later Congress passed a declaration of war against Germany.   After the war ended, Danish-born artist John C. Johansen portrayed the treaty-signing ceremonies at Versailles in 1919. The disillusion that accompanied the outbreak of World War I, supplanted by the enthusiasm and idealism accompanying America's entry into the war, returned in the final outcome. The United States and the Allies won, but it was not, as Wilson had proclaimed, the ""war to end all wars."" His hope for a lasting peace, protecting the sovereignty of all nations rather than punishing the vanquished, and his vision of a League of Nations did not survive the realities of international politics. Americans turned away from idealism. Prohibition, ratified in the Eighteenth Amendment in 1919, is viewed by many historians as the last gasp of early-twentieth-century reform. Many Americans then turned their attention to the more mundane matters of making money, consuming mass-produced goods, and immersing themselves in popular culture. The Roaring Twenties had begun."
13484,"Thirty-fourth President, 1953-61    When Time named Dwight D. Eisenhower as its Man of the Year for 1959, it marked the second time he had received this media distinction; the first was in 1944, when he was winning victories as the supreme commander of Allied forces in Europe during World War II. Fifteen years later, Eisenhower, as president, was winning distinction for all but concluding two terms marked by peace and record prosperity. Time's editors had no difficulty in justifying their selection over such other noteworthy leaders of the free world as British prime minister Harold Macmillan, West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer, and French president Charles de Gaulle. In his goodwill trips abroad that year, Eisenhower was looked upon by millions of admirers as the model and the hope for all peace-loving peoples.     Time cover, January 4, 1960"
13520,"Time asked Robert Vickrey to make this cover portrait of Nikita Khrushchev in late 1962, shortly after President Kennedy had forced the Soviet leader to remove his missiles from Cuba. The magazine’s editors guessed that Khrushchev was feeling pretty glum, having lost face in one of the most dramatic instances of the Cold War’s confrontational diplomacy. They suggested, therefore, that Vickrey endow the likeness with a vaguely sour expression. Time usually refrained from making such editorial requests of its artists, but in this case it seemed warranted. The magazine was realistic enough to know that Khrushchev was still a force to be reckoned with: the story that accompanied this picture warned that he still had “a great many tricks left in the back of his shrewd peasant mind.”  Nikita Khrushchev  1894–1971     Time solicitó a Robert Vickrey este retrato de Nikita Khrushchev a finales de 1962, poco después de que el presidente Kennedy obligara al líder soviético a sacar sus misiles de Cuba. Los editores de la revista supusieron que Khrushchev estaría bastante decaído luego de perder una de las batallas más dramáticas de la confrontación diplomática que fue la Guerra Fría. Entonces sugirieron a Vickrey que diera al retrato un leve aire de amargura. En general, Time se abstenía de estas peticiones de carácter editorial a sus artistas, pero en este caso parecía justificada. De todos modos, la revista era lo bastante realista como para saber que Khrushchev todavía era una fuerza que había que tener en cuenta, y el artículo que acompañó a esta imagen afirmaba que aún “le quedaban muchos trucos allá en el fondo de su astuta mente campesina”.     Robert Vickrey (1926–2011)  Témpera sobre cartón, 1962  Portada de Time, 9 de noviembre de 1962"
13524,"Born New York City    Jerome David Salinger had one of the great successes of all time with The Catcher in the Rye (1951). He then vanished, publishing only a few collections of short stories and emerging only to sue people who attempted to write about him; his last publication was in 1965. Yet Catcher in the Rye remains a classic. Its teenaged narrator Holden Caulfield's account of a weekend in Manhattan continues to speak to disaffected adolescents kicking against the ""phonies."" It has sold more than 65 million copies worldwide and is still occasionally banned by education administrators who fear its corrupting impact on alienated youth. Here, in a way that Salinger (and Caulfield) would have appreciated, the artist interprets the book's title literally and paints the author against an amber wave of grain."
13585,"There were those who noted a touch of insanity in abolitionist John Brown; he believed he had been called by God to embark on a personal crusade to end slavery. Brown and five of his sons were actively engaged in the bloody guerrilla war being waged in Kansas in 1855-56, between proslavery and antislavery factions. But in 1857, Brown began making plans for the 1859 raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, an event that would make him both infamous and immortal. The scheme to commandeer firearms with which to arm a slave rebellion failed, and Brown was captured, tried, and hanged. His insurrection found favor among many northern abolitionists. In response, southerners viewed Brown as a sign that they must either break their allegiance to the Union or be destroyed by an increasingly fanatical North.  "
13611,"On July 4, 1863, when Ulysses S. Grant captured Vicksburg, Mississippi, it ended a yearlong campaign and put control of the Mississippi River firmly in Union hands. A siege lasting forty-seven days, in which some 200 Federal cannons pounded the city daily, drove many residents into caves dug in the hillsides that were furnished with household possessions, as seen in this sketch. ""And so the weary days went on,"" recalled one matronly cave-dweller, ""when we could not tell in what terrible form death might come to us before the sun went down."""
13705,"Nathaniel Bowditch was one of America’s great practical scientists. His contributions to navigation and astronomy were signal achievements in the new republic, helping to create an identity distinct from England. Self-taught and ambitious, Bowditch had a successful career as a businessman but also turned his restless mind to scientific inquiry. His most important book was the New Practical Navigator (1802), which simplified navigational problems for seamen.   Bowditch’s bust rests on the first volume of his translation and annotation of Pierre-Simon de Laplace’s Celestial Mechanics, a study of physical astronomy."
13731,"On May 1, 1960, the USSR shot down an American U-2 spy plane that had entered its airspace. Believing the plane destroyed and the pilot dead, the U.S. declared it a weather plane. When Nikita Khrushchev announced the recovery of the plane and pilot, he gave Eisenhower a way out, suggesting the president was not aware of the flights. Eisenhower would not play along; he defended the flights but promised not to resume them. Three weeks later, at the start of the Paris summit to ease Cold War tensions, Khrushchev denounced the flights as ""aggressive . . . treacherous, [and] . . . incompatible [with] . . . normal relations between states in times of peace."" He continued, ""We reserve the right to retaliate against those who . . . violate . . . national sovereignty."" Later, Khrushchev acknowledged that ""internal politics"" forced him to react as he did."
13912,"About the time that Gaston Lachaise drew this portrait sketch of Hart Crane dancing, the poet wrote to a friend, ""I'm the acknowledged crack dancer everywhere now, and was even in danger for a while of having to pose quite nude for Lachaise, which would have been rather tiresome I imagine."" Lachaise befriended the writer in 1923 when both were contributing to the avant-garde arts journal The Dial. Although the portrait resembles Crane, with his heavy brow, full lips, and brushed-back hair, the idealized figure also suggests the inspiration of ancient Greek sculptures of male youths. Harassed as a homosexual and addicted to alcohol, Crane battled depression throughout his life and died in 1932 after jumping off a ship. But his friends had always enjoyed the exuberant, fun-loving side of Crane's personality that Lachaise's drawing evokes.  "
13996,"Known for her biting caricatures, Aline Fruhauf was equally incisive when turning her attention to herself. Like Calder's portrait of her, Fruhauf's self-portrait accentuates her astonished expression, bushy eyebrows, and round head atop an impossibly long neck. Fruhauf's frank assessment of Calder's drawing is germane here, too: ""The result was a caricature that revealed not only my own shortcomings, but those of the poorly endowed relatives on both sides of my family."" Fruhauf's visage-like those of her better-known compatriots Calvin Coolidge and Jimmy Durante-lent itself to caricature; for Calder, hers was a dream face."
14003,"Before embarking on her celebrated writing career, Edith Newbold Jones Wharton led a privileged life as a member of New York society. Edward Harrison May, a British-born artist working in Paris, painted her portrait during an extensive family sojourn in Europe. Wharton, who would become famous for her critical depictions of the New York upper class, as in the Pulitzer Prize-winning Age of Innocence, was strongly influenced by these European trips of her youth. As an adult she chose to spend much of her life abroad, forming friendships with other American expatriates, such as Henry James. Despite Wharton's cheerful demeanor in this portrait, she would later chronicle the frustrations of her childhood. Yet it was during this time that she came to enjoy ""making up,"" occupying the fictional worlds she would write about as an adult.  "
14114,"Frank O’Hara is one of the most important poets of postwar America, and his reputation has only grown since his tragic early death. O’Hara was a leading figure in making American poetry more confessional, intimate, and personal. He rejected abstraction and theoretical posturing for a direct and immediate style whose subjects were generated from his day-to-day encounters with people and places. (A curator at the Museum of Modern Art, O’Hara was known for writing a poem every lunch hour.) His relaxed, humorous, and offhand style does not mean that he did not take his art or his subjects seriously; poems such as “The Day Lady Died” pack a punch because he interwove trivial events with the enormity of Billie Holiday’s death. O’Hara became an influential member of the New York School of both writing and painting; he was a friend and collaborator of the artist Larry Rivers, who made the memorial portrait O’Hara Reading seen in this exhibition. O’Hara published six slim books of poetry between 1952 and 1965, but after his horribly painful death (he was hit by a dune buggy on Fire Island and died several days later), hundreds of poems were discovered in his apartment. The resulting Collected Poems (1971) won him a posthumous Pulitzer Prize and cemented O’Hara’s reputation as the major poetic voice of his generation."
14140,"Nicknamed the ""Boy Orator of the Platte,"" William Jennings Bryan emerged at the nineteenth century's end as the leading political voice for voters in the West. Bryan's rise to fame began with his election to Congress in 1890. A lifelong Democrat, the Nebraska representative also shared common ground with members of the newly created Populist Party. His support for government ownership of the railroads and limited inflation through coinage of both silver and gold won him wide support in the West. An energetic campaigner whose ""Cross of Gold"" speech at the 1896 Democratic Convention propelled him to the presidential nomination, Bryan was ultimately defeated that year by Republican William McKinley. He ran unsuccessfully for president on two other occasions as well. Famous for his devout religious views and his role as a political crusader, Bryan was also known as ""the Protestant Pope,"" a label given him by satirist H. L. Mencken."
14273,"John C. Frémont (1813–1890) was the Republican Party’s candidate in the presidential election of 1856. The new political party was the first to oppose the extension of slavery into the western territories. This cartoon lampoons Frémont by falsely associating him with several social causes, some highly controversial at the time. The six people in line addressing Frémont personify the reform movements of temperance, women’s rights, socialism, libertarianism, Catholicism, and equal rights for blacks. Frémont tells them, ""You shall all have what you desire.""  Frémont would lose the election of 1856 to the Democratic Party’s candidate, James Buchannan. Only four years later, Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, would validate the fledgling party with his victory in the historic election of 1860. "
14278,"The appearance of folk singer Joan Baez at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival spawned offers of lucrative recording and tour contracts, all of which she turned down. After performing at the festival in 1960, she finally consented to make her first album, which was an instant success. A woman of passionate convictions, Baez became increasingly identified with the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War, and the proceeds from many of her concerts went to financing those causes.  This photograph was taken during the March on Washington to demand federal guarantees of full equality for African Americans. At the march's climactic gathering at the Lincoln Memorial on August 28, 1963, Baez led the crowd in singing the civil rights movement's anthem, ""We Shall Overcome."" It was a moment that she came to count as one of the greatest honors of her life. "
14289,"This satirical broadside, dated July 2, 1861, mocks President Lincoln and his cabinet members for their efforts to reunite the union by force of arms. The unidentified artist, a Baltimore secessionist, used a title from an ancient proverb, ""great cry and little wool,"" whose meaning is similar to the more modern saying, ""to cry over spilt milk."""
14322,"Born near Crawfordville, Georgia     As vice president of the Confederacy, Alexander Stephens held a position that he considered beneath his political talents, and he quickly grew frustrated in the job. In 1863 he tried—unsuccessfully—to negotiate prisoner-of-war exchanges with federal authorities. In February 1865, during a peace negotiation with President Abraham Lincoln—a venture doomed to fail from the start—he prevailed successfully upon Lincoln, an old Whig Party friend, to win the release of his nephew from a Union prison. After the war, Stephens spent five months in a northern prison. Between 1873 and 1882 he served in the U.S. House of Representatives before being elected governor of Georgia. Plagued by ill health for most of his adult life, Stephens died at the start of his governorship. This lithograph, which appeared in Puck magazine, depicts the ailing congressman in 1882. "
14334,"Renowned for her sultry voice and languorous sophistication, actress Tallulah Bankhead exuded magnetism-""a remarkable personality with a remarkable name"" to one enchanted critic. She performed not only in America but also in London, where she was painted by Augustus John: ""At the time, I was the toast of London and that was some toast, dahling."" She twice won the New York Drama Critics Award, as Regina in The Little Foxes in 1939 and as Sabina in The Skin of Our Teeth in 1942. Bankhead also starred in movies-notably Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat in 1944-and on television, where she emceed NBC's Sunday-night Big Show and appeared on that network's All Star Revue. At the height of her career in the late 1940s, Time magazine called her ""the theater's first personality."""
14393,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
14435,"More accurately, this photograph should be titled Abraham Lincoln and George McClellan and Staff. Dissatisfied with General McClellan’s nonresponsiveness after Antietam—he did not pursue Robert E. Lee’s army, nor did he convey any urgency in getting his own army back into action—Abraham Lincoln went out to Maryland in October to meet with him. (McClellan had a habit of making the commander in chief come to him, which Lincoln tolerated but also noted as a sign of the officer’s arrogance.) In this portrait, McClellan, diminutive and in a forage cap, faces the figure of the president who, complete with trademark stovepipe hat, towers over him and the rest of the officers. Standing at the far right is cavalry captain George A. Custer."
14557,"Born Uniontown, Pennsylvania  As chief of staff of the United States Army (1939–45), General George C. Marshall became the principal architect of the Allied victory in World War II. An officer with a reputation for personal integrity and administrative competence, Marshall strove to heighten U.S. combat readiness following his 1938 appointment to head the army’s War Plans Division. After the United States entered the war in 1941, Marshall played a critical role in appointing top U.S. commanders, training America’s fighting forces, formulating military strategy, and working effectively with the nation’s allies. He was FDR’s most trusted military adviser, and his service to the nation continued after the war. As secretary of state in 1947, he launched what became known as the Marshall Plan—the bold U.S. initiative to provide desperately needed economic and humanitarian aid to war-ravaged Europe. Marshall’s efforts were recognized in 1953 when he received the Nobel Peace Prize."
14873,"   Born Louisville, Kentucky　  Few American boxers have possessed athletic talents comparable to those of Muhammad Ali, nor could many equal him for charisma and bravado. Turning professional after a gold medal win at the 1960 Olympics, Ali (born Cassius Clay) attained the heavyweight crown in 1964. His skill, along with his words and actions outside the ring—including outrageous boasts in poetic verse—won him a huge international following. However, controversy ensued when he joined the Nation of Islam and refused to serve in Vietnam, and he was stripped of his title. After being reinstated, Ali would reclaim the heavyweight crown, lose it, and regain it again before retiring in 1981. Ali was an ideal subject for one of Andy Warhol’s explorations of fame. But instead of showing the shallow surface of mass media–driven consumer culture, Warhol depicted Ali in an unexpectedly quiet, introspective pose. "
14895,"Janis Joplin and Big Brother and the Holding Company     When Texas-born singer Janis Joplin (1943-1970) joined the San Francisco band Big Brother and the Holding Company, she propelled the group to the top of the rock scene. A passionate, bluesy singer with a raw, powerful voice, Joplin electrified audiences with her sexualized performance style, delivered with explosive movements and a variety of wailing, whispering, and shrieking sounds. Before her tragic death of a drug overdose at age twenty-seven, Joplin had become a female rock icon. This 1967 advertisement for Big Brother's appearance at a club called the Matrix was designed by Victor Moscoso, a pioneer and master of the psychedelic rock poster. Discarding his extensive art training at the Cooper Union in New York and at Yale, Moscoso produced some of the boldest advertising of the era, enlivened with searing, clashing colors and deliberately illegible lettering. "
14919,"William Cullen Bryant brought the Romantic movement into American literature with his 1817 poem ""Thanatopsis."" His nature poems include ""To a Waterfowl,"" which the English poet Matthew Arnold called ""the most perfect brief poem in the language."" But in early America, poetry was no way to make a living, and Bryant's main career was as a crusading newspaper editor at the New York Evening Post. Bryant's abhorrence of slavery made him a fervent Republican and a devout supporter of Lincoln, although he wished that Lincoln was more radical on abolition. His last literary work was a translation of Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.  "
14956,"Born Charlottesville, Virginia  Under the alias S. S. Van Dine, Willard Huntington Wright became famous for his detective fiction, beginning with The Benson Murder Case (1926), which sold out in a week. But earlier, he had helped advance new ideas in art, literature, and journalism. As an editor, he transformed Smart Set, a fashionable repository of light stories and verse, into a serious journal, publishing such writers as D. H. Lawrence and Theodore Dreiser. As an art critic, he championed advanced trends in the press and in his books Modern Painting (1915) and The Future of Painting (1923).  Wright’s brother, Stanton MacDonald-Wright, painted this portrait around 1913–14, just at the time the artist was introducing his abstract ""synchromist"" painting style, based on color theory. This portrait, however, emphasizes the bold hues and flat planes of color that MacDonald-Wright absorbed from French painting."
15106,"While best known for his collages, Romare Bearden chose a variety of different mediums to express himself as an artist. In addition to paintings and drawings, he created murals, tapestries, and posters, and in several instances he composed music to accompany his works. A gregarious man with a passion for jazz, he described art-making as ""a kind of divine play."" Bearden grew up in Harlem and in Pittsburgh, and studied painting with George Grosz at the Art Students League. Following service in an all-black regiment during World War II, he returned to New York, where he became immersed in a thriving art scene. Bearden's work reflects many influences: the places he lived and traveled, African American history and literature, and religious traditions and community rituals that bound people together. In 1987 President Ronald Reagan awarded him the National Medal of Arts."
15130,"Since the late nineteenth century, the editorial cartoon has played a provocative role in presidential politics, countering partisan advertising with irreverence. Australian-born Pulitzer-Prize winner Pat Oliphant (born 1935) hones a distinctive, repeatable caricature of each incoming president. When each fails to live up to expectations, those exaggerated figures begin to age, sag, shrink, weaken, or bloat. Oliphant has summarized his cartoon depictions of each president since Lyndon Johnson in a series of bronze sculptures. His images of Richard Nixon as a haunting and malevolent Napoleon, Gerald Ford as Band-Aided hollow mask, Jimmy Carter as an insignificant miniature, and George H. W. Bush as a wizened horseshoe player, remind us of the powerful impact of satiric portraiture."
15139,"Throughout the 1960s, Time explored a variety of social trends, including the hippie phenomenon in a cover story in 1967. “The hippies have emerged on the U.S. scene in about 18 months,” reported the magazine, “as a wholly new subculture, a bizarre permutation of the middle-class American ethos from which it evolved.” Hippies were mostly in their late teens and early twenties, often well-educated, and preached “altruism and mysticism, honesty, joy and nonviolence.” They dressed unconventionally, in bright colors, often adorned in beads and bangles. Many tended to live together in communes, which began springing up throughout the country, especially in San Francisco, the heartland of hippiedom. They tripped on music that was “psychedelic,” a new word they popularized, which the dictionary defined as “a mental state of great calm” enhanced by the “influence of hallucinogenic drugs.”  Hippies     A lo largo de los sesenta, Time exploró una diversidad de tendencias sociales, entre ellas el fenómeno de los hippies, a quienes dedicó su artículo principal en 1967. “Los hippies han surgido en el panorama estadounidense en apenas 18 meses”, reportaba la revista, “como una subcultura totalmente nueva, extraña permutación del etos clasemediero americano del cual se derivó”. En su mayoría fluctuaban entre adolescentes y veinteañeros, a menudo bien educados, que predicaban “el altruismo y el misticismo, la honradez, la alegría y el pacifismo”. Vestían de manera insólita, en colores vivos, y se adornaban con pulseras y accesorios hechos de cuentas. Muchos solían vivir juntos en comunas, estilo que se extendió a través del país, sobre todo en San Francisco, el corazón del movimiento hippie. Su música era “psicodélica”, palabra nueva que ellos popularizaron y que el diccionario definía como “estado mental de suma calma” realzado por el “efecto de drogas alucinógenas”.

15310,"In Victor Hammer's study for a 1937 painting, the Austrian-born artist portrayed himself as a craftsman presenting the product of his labor, a book he is binding. Hammer maintained his interests in printing and book arts after he moved to America in 1939. The rectilinear background lines, which may indicate his antique press, also reveal his fascination with framing devices and the internal structure of a picture. ""How sweet it is to tell a story, tell it in those cold, geometrical terms,"" he once wrote. ""I am engrossed in the abstract design. . . . Why shouldn't I paint a portrait as if it were a triangle, and at the same time give a Likeness?"" The delicate tonalities and subtly reflective luster of the drawing were achieved with silverpoint, a Renaissance technique using a silver stylus on a prepared ground.  "
15325,"Rembrandt Peale, son of American artist Charles Willson Peale, painted George Washington from life in 1795 when he was seventeen. He later made numerous portraits of the president based on his memory of this sitting and on likenesses by other artists. From these he developed an idealized image-known by the Latin name ""Patriae Pater"" (Father of His Country)-which served as a model for his many so-called ""porthole"" portraits of Washington. In these compositions, the subject's face is seen through an oval stonework frame-an honorific convention in European art dating from the Renaissance."
15373,"Novelist and poet William Gilmore Simms was a founder of a distinctly southern literary perspective, one that is influential in history and literature to this day. Simms spent his life writing, turning out a series of colorful novels as well as a substantial body of verse. He invested his fiction with local color and details of southern history, especially from the Revolutionary War period. Like Washington Irving, he adapted the style of Sir Walter Scott's historical novels to American narratives. Simms's writings were a conscious defense of southern civilization (including slavery) as humane, patriotic, and chivalric, especially in contrast to the cold capitalism of the North. This contrast, minus the defense of slavery, remains a staple of southern writing."
15395,"The peace treaty bringing the War of 1812 to a close had been signed on Christmas Eve 1814, but word had not yet reached New Orleans, where Andrew Jackson (bottom center) defended the city from British attack. With a force of 2,000-a relatively few regular army soldiers augmented by the New Orleans battalion of Free Men of Colour, militiamen from Louisiana and Mississippi, and the pirates of Barataria Bay-Jackson went against some 8,000 seasoned British regulars. Thanks to the labor of some 900 slaves, the American troops were sheltered behind a strong defensive works of logs and cotton bales, and the British, as they advanced, were hit by an overpowering rain of cannon and musket fire. General Edward Pakenham, shot through the throat and chest, died within minutes.  "
15483,"This photograph of President Theodore Roosevelt and his cabinet was taken by the noted Washington studio Harris and Ewing in 1906, an especially productive year for the reform-minded administration.  That year Roosevelt signed the Hepburn Act, which increased federal regulation of such giant monopolies as John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company and J. P. Morgan's Northern Securities Company, which were fixing railroad shipping rates to their advantage.  Roosevelt also signed the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906, as well as the Meat Inspection Act, to provide basic levels of consumer protections.  As president, he initiated more conservation measures than all of his predecessors combined, including the Antiquities Act of 1906, which designated eighteen new national monuments. And for his efforts the previous year to mediate a successful end to the Russo-Japanese War, Roosevelt won the 1906 Nobel Peace Prize.   "
15491,"Heavyweight champion Joe Louis was so popular in the 1930s, according to reporter Earl Brown, that ""his huge picture in fighting togs"" adorned many African American community gathering spots. Different fighting togs but the same popular appeal made for an extremely effective government war poster, utilizing only the dramatically posed figure, an inspirational quote, and a vivid blue background. The poster does not attempt to recruit troops, sell war bonds, or encourage hard work in the factories. It is a general message to fellow black Americans to ""do our part."" Louis himself, who had turned down a commission when he enlisted in the army, helped to integrate athletic programs, boxed in exhibition matches to entertain the troops, and helped to raise money for military relief funds. At the end of the war, the army commended him for ""exceptionally meritorious service."""
15588,"In the face of racial hatred, segregation, and disenfranchisement following the Civil War, it was unrealistic, Booker T. Washington contended, to expect African Americans to gain entry into America's white-collar professions. Instead, he suggested they establish themselves as a skilled and indispensable laboring class. With that accomplished, racial discrimination would gradually disappear. In 1881 Washington put this theory to the test, becoming the director of the newly created Negro Normal School in Tuskegee, Alabama. As the school grew, Washington became viewed as the nation's leading spokesman for African Americans. Yet by the century's end, many critics began to challenge his ""get along"" philosophy.  "
15595,"Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher wrote elegant books and essays about the history, sociology, and pleasures of food. From the joys of a tangerine section toasted on a radiator and then cooled on a snowy windowsill to the taste of her first raw oyster, Fisher, with her sensuous prose, won the respect of many literary figures, including W. H. Auden and John Updike, who called her ""a poet of the appetites."" She spent much of her life in California, where she wrote such classics as Consider the Oyster (1941) and How to Cook a Wolf (1942), which gave advice on cooking with wartime rations. Late in life, while living in Glen Ellen, California, she sat for Ginny Stanford, who captured a strong woman looking into an unknown future ""illuminated by a single silver icon."""
15655,"Even the name seemed psychedelic. Jefferson Airplane was one of the first rock bands to fully capture the counterculture of the mid-1960s, quickly gaining national and then international fame. This 1966 poster featured a photograph of the band with its new lead vocalist, Grace Slick (born 1939). Jefferson Airplane’s irreverent lyrics—with references to sex, drugs, and radical politics—pulsating sound, and Slick’s soaring contralto and dramatic stage presence, launched the band into the national consciousness. The psychedelic posters commissioned by rock impresario Bill Graham for San Francisco’s Fillmore Auditorium suggest the dizzying, multisensory experience of many Fillmore events, which were often charged with high-decibel music, light shows, and mind-altering drugs. Although the wild lettering and colors that designer Wes Wilson used rendered the advertisement almost illegible, this innovative style successfully evoked the burgeoning hippie counterculture. "
15672,"Born East Sudbury, Massachusetts     A self-taught artist, Josiah Hawes (left), shown with his brothers, earned his living for more than a decade as an itinerant painter of portrait miniatures and other works before turning to daguerreotypy in 1841. Two years later he joined A. Southworth & Co., the Boston daguerreian gallery that soon would be known as Southworth & Hawes. Hawes shared camera duties with Albert Sands Southworth, who cited his partner’s credentials as an artist in advertisements promoting their portrait business, a partnership that endured until 1862."
15719,"In the summer of 1862, Union general Benjamin F. Butler addressed a pressing need for reinforcement troops. Acting on his own authority as the military governor of Louisiana, he approved the formation of the First Regiment of Louisiana Native Guards, to be composed entirely of free black recruits. Some of those joining this new regiment had previously served the Confederacy as members of a short-lived, all-black militia unit known as the Louisiana Native Guards. They had been left behind, however, when white Confederate militia regiments abandoned New Orleans to Union forces in April 1862. Mustered into Union service in September 1862, Butler’s Native Guards later performed heroically at the Battle of Port Hudson (July 1863), despite devastating enemy fire.  When Harper’s Weekly published these images of the First Louisiana Native Guards, it noted that although several of the company’s officers could easily be mistaken for white, they all carried ""African blood"" in their veins."
15724,"The son of renowned actor James O'Neill, playwright Eugene O'Neill helped revolutionize Broadway in the 1920s and 1930s by replacing the vogue for melodrama with a more modern and realistic theater. His work in these years-including Anna Christie (1920), The Emperor Jones (1920), Desire Under the Elms (1924), Mourning Becomes Electra (1929-31), and Ah, Wilderness! (1932)-brought a vernacular voice to drama and established O'Neill as America's leading playwright; his work was so well known that the Marx Brothers did a parody of O'Neill soliloquies in Animal Crackers (1930). O'Neill's plays were often lengthy, and written in a sparse style that broached powerful emotions and such dark themes as incest and retribution; Ah, Wilderness! was an exception, a comedy focusing on lighthearted nostalgia instead of Freudian angst. For his body of early work, O'Neill was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936."
15834,"After fighting Indians with Andrew Jackson, Sam Houston became governor and then a congressman in Tennessee until a murky marital scandal killed his political career in 1829. By 1835 he was training a small army in Texas as American colonists there resisted Mexican restrictions on them. When war broke out, Houston led his army to victory and was elected first president of the Republic of Texas. Although he argued for independence, in 1846 he agreed to Texas's annexation by the United States. Houston served Texas as a senator and governor, but resigned the governorship when Texas moved to secede from the Union in 1861."
15853,"Benjamin Franklin Butler was a Democratic politician in military garb fighting a Republican war, and he sorely tried the patience of Lincoln and his advisers. His heavy-handed administration of the military district of New Orleans in 1862 was especially controversial. Butler was accused of everything from issuing orders designed to harass female secessionists to pilfering the silver spoons from the house he occupied.  In the summer of 1864, Butler wrote his wife asking if she wanted to see him. If so, he continued, ""Do the next best thing-send down to Brackett and get the marble bust he has done."""
15961,"Red Grooms, like fellow Tennessean William Eggleston (whose work is also in this room), has often memorialized Elvis in his art. In this image, he arms Elvis with his trademark flashy apparel and accompanying guitar, but a slightly closer observation will yield several other components of Elvis's iconographic ensemble-the lip curl, the slick, combed-back hair, the omnipresent Cadillac, Graceland, and the stylized stage posture. One of the famous gates of Graceland is swung open behind the entertainer while a woman in a red dress and black high heels observes the singer from the porch of the mansion.   Grooms is to American art as Mark Twain is to American writing; he is the foremost humorist in his discipline. He is also a prolific artist who works in many media. "
16145,"America needed to pause and smile a little when this cartoon of Charles Schulz’s endearing Peanuts comic-strip characters appeared on the April 9, 1965, Time cover. Time’s editors may not have even been aware that the date marked the one-hundredth anniversary of Robert E. Lee’s historic surrender at Appomattox Court House, virtually ending the four-year Civil War. The country was actively fighting new wars in Vietnam and in its own cities filled with unrest, and Time’s covers not infrequently bore the stern faces of military generals and civil rights leaders. The debut of Charlie Brown and his cartoon friends on Time was a welcome relief for readers across the country.     El mundo según Peanuts     Justo cuando el país necesitaba hacer una pausa y sonreír un poco, Time publicó en su portada el 9 de abril de 1965 este dibujo de los adorables personajes de la tirilla Peanuts (Rabanitos) de Charles Schulz. Los editores de la revista quizá no se dieron cuenta de que la fecha coincidía con el centenario de la histórica rendición de Robert E. Lee en la batalla de Appomattox Court House, que prácticamente puso fin a cuatro años de guerra civil. Ahora Estados Unidos libraba nuevas batallas en Vietnam y en sus propias ciudades que hervían de agitación, por lo cual las portadas de Time a menudo mostraban rostros severos de generales del ejército o líderes de los derechos civiles. El debut de Charlie Brown y sus amigos en Time fue un momento de humor bienvenido por los lectores de todo el país.

16255,"Over his long, calculated, and prize-winning career as America’s best-loved poet, Robert Frost became the epitome of the New England Yankee: a weathered, craggy, flinty, and plainspoken countryman who turned ordinary life into poetry. Ironies abound. He was born in San Francisco and named after Robert E. Lee. Stereotyped as a regionalist, Frost received a major boost from the rootless modernist Ezra Pound. Uniquely American, Frost’s first two books were assembled and published in England before appearing in his homeland. Seemingly artless, because it is about artless subjects, Frost’s verse was a complicated formalist response to modernism—and to democracy. Frost did the most difficult thing: he made the complex weave of his poems appear easy or natural, leading to their persistent underestimation. Seemingly straightforward and reverential, his poems are sly, subversive. There was no less-traveled road in ""The Road Not Taken""; both paths are equally unworn, and the choice is false—or more terrifyingly, meaningless. As the years advanced, the Yankee persona won more often than not, and he tapped into a complacent, conservative populism, one that was not as benign or as avuncular as his audience sometimes assumed. Recovering that ""lost past’s / detail"" was Frost’s original task, one that cropped like granite through his most powerful work."
16267,"On February 9, 1950, a little known junior senator from Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy, proclaimed that he had a list of 205 Communist Party members who worked in the State Department with the full knowledge of the secretary of state. McCarthy's speech came shortly after the Communist takeover in China, the U.S.S.R.'s successful detonation of an atomic bomb, and suspected spy Alger Hiss's conviction for perjury. For many, McCarthy's charges explained why the West was experiencing setbacks, and made him a formidable political force. It marked the beginning of demagogic red baiting and made the term ""McCarthyism"" synonymous with hysterical anti-Communism. McCarthy had no evidence for his accusations and was censured by the Senate in 1954; ""McCarthyism"" would be remembered for its corrosive effect on America's ability to deal effectively with real Communists abroad and at home. Sitting to McCarthy's left is Roy Cohn, lead investigator for McCarthy's Senate subcommittee."
16268,"A major figure in twentieth-century industrial unionism, John L. Lewis was born into a coal mining family and worked in the mines himself. In 1901, he joined the United Mine Workers of America, rose in the ranks, and was elected its president in 1920, when it was the largest union in the American Federation of Labor (AFL). During the 1920s, tough times for labor unions, Lewis consolidated his control, suppressing opposition with armed force and ballot-stuffing tactics. In 1932, perceiving an opportunity with the incoming Roosevelt administration, he adroitly influenced the setting of labor codes in the National Recovery Administration to benefit coal workers-and his own position. He broke with the AFL in 1935, forming what would become the Congress of Industrial Organizations and leading successful struggles to unionize the nation's automobile, steel, rubber, and electrical appliance industries.   "
16275,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania     America’s first literary professional, Charles Brockden Brown produced six important novels between 1798 and 1801, and was also a magazine contributor and editor. He and William Dunlap were lifelong friends; this miniature was painted when Brown had settled into married life and his journalistic work, and just a few years before his death from tuberculosis. It is a fine example of the luminosity possible with transparent watercolor on ivory."
16278,"An actor turned inventor, Isaac Singer democratized clothing production with the sewing machine he patented in 1851. Although not the first (Elias Howe introduced a design in 1846), Singer's machine was more reliable and capable of continuous stitching. Hailed two years after its appearance as ""one of the most efficient labor-saving devices ever introduced to public notice,"" Singer's machine could sew 900 stitches per minute, more than twenty times as many as a skilled seamstress. Aiming the product at women and putting it within reach of a wide range of buyers, Singer and his business partner Edward Clark established an international commercial empire.  Singer commissioned this portrait while living in Paris, after scandals about his private life forced him to relocate to Europe. American artist Edward Harrison May painted him in clothing that reflects his wealth and trademark extravagance.  "
16343,"In politics, mention of the Great Depression evokes Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal; in painting, it summons up images of federally funded WPA murals depicting the nation's workforce. And in American letters, the work most synonymous with those hard times is The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck's best-selling novel portraying the spirit-breaking poverty that overtook so much of the country's rural economy in the wake of prolonged drought and falling crop prices. When the book appeared in 1939, Steinbeck had already tasted popular success with his two novels Tortilla Flat and Of Mice and Men. Grapes of Wrath, however, earned him an acclaim that few American writers have enjoyed. No recent novel, one critic said at its publication, was ""better calculated to awaken the humanity of others."" In 1962, Steinbeck's literary accomplishments earned him the Nobel Prize for Literature.   "
16376,"Opposed to the increasing wave of American settlement on Comanche lands, Quanah Parker emerged as one of the leaders of the Red River War, which was fought on the southern plains in 1874-75. For him the historic encounter between non-Natives and the Comanche shaped many elements of his life. His mother was a white woman who had been captured as a child. His father-an important tribal chief-fought the U.S. military on repeated occasions. Following the surrender of the Comanche to federal authorities in 1875, Parker decided to accept a new life. In time he became a prosperous farmer and rancher with property of more than forty thousand acres. He was also politically active, rising to become the principal chief of the Comanche and often serving in a diplomatic role with U.S. officials. Yet his decision to wear his hair in braids, to practice polygamy, and to use peyote in ceremonies suggested his continuing desire for an independent life."
16377,"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked. With this, the first line of Howl (1955), Allen Ginsberg launched the postwar counterculture's revolt against the American status quo. The ""Beat movement"" got its name from the sense that it was time to beat back at mainstream America with a new ""beat,"" a new language that expressed the primal emotions of rebellion. Howl was also Ginsberg's coming-out as a poet, as he allowed his unmediated voice to pour out. With Howl, his biographer Bill Morgan wrote, ""Allen finally accepted his homosexuality and stopped trying to become 'straight'"" in all meanings of the word. In this photograph, Ginsberg presents himself as a buttoned-down Jewish college student whose appearance gives no indication of the turmoil that would result in America's greatest long poem since Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass. "
16388,"Here, Grant is portrayed as lieutenant general of the United States, a rank previously held only by George Washington and a lofty perch for the young man who had no great ambition for a military career. Grant’s reputation as a general has waxed and waned. Overall, Lee is generally considered superior, although some of his reputation is inflated by the esteem to which he is held in the South as the ideal southerner. Lee was incredibly skilled on the battlefield, but Grant had a better overall sense of how to wage war, especially the combined activities of distant armies and the way tactics changed with modern weaponry. It has been said that Grant understood the “progressive” nature of war in a way that Lee did not. If Lee is still preferred to Grant, it may be because we see the Union general as the harbinger of World War I and its horrendous casualties.   Ulysses S. Grant     Aquí, Grant es retratado como teniente general de los Estados Unidos, un rango que solamente tuvo George Washington y una posición elevada para el joven que no tenía una gran ambición por una carrera militar. La reputación de Grant como general se ha encerado y debilitado. En general, Lee es usualmente considerado superior, aunque parte de su reputación está inflada por la estima que le tienen en el sur como el sureño ideal. Lee era increíblemente habilidoso en el campo de batalla pero Grant tenía un mejor entendimiento general de cómo librar una guerra, especialmente sobre las actividades combinadas de ejércitos distantes y la forma en que cambiaron las tácticas con el armamento moderno. Se dijo que Grant entendía la naturaleza ""progresiva"" de la guerra de una manera en que Lee no lo hacía. Si todavía se prefiere a Lee antes que a Grant, puede ser porque vemos al general de la Unión como el precursor de la Primera Guerra Mundial y sus espantosas muertes.

16429,"Seven Ages of Man  The Meade Brothers exhibited numerous examples of their work at the ""Great Exhibition"" held in New York City’s Crystal Palace (1853–54), including a series of daguerreotypes by Charles Meade illustrating Shakespeare’s ""seven ages,"" as described in Act II of As You Like It. Lauded by the Photographic Art Journal for reflecting ""much talent"" and ""a high degree of cultivated taste,"" the Meade Brothers’ Seven Ages of Man—Infant, Schoolboy, Lover, Soldier, Justice, Pantaloon, and Second Childishness—later circulated in the form of card-mounted photographs known as cartes de visite."
16440,"Herbert Hoover seemed to be the ultimate problem-solver. As a mining engineer, he had turned marginal operations into thriving enterprises. During World War I, his administration of European food relief was nothing short of brilliant. As secretary of commerce in the 1920s, he transformed a once-sleepy department into a purposeful information clearinghouse.  But as the Great Depression took hold during the second year of his presidency, Hoover was hard pressed for a solution. Believing in the power of private initiative, he hesitated to involve the federal government in reviving business. When lengthening bread lines and escalating joblessness finally convinced him of the necessity of such steps, the measures proved inadequate. As a result, Hoover was defeated by a crushing margin in his 1932 reelection bid.  This portrait was intended for Time magazine's cover. But Hoover delayed his sittings, and by the time it was finished, the magazine was no longer interested. Hoover is thus the only president in Time's history never to appear on a cover while in office.  "
16642,"Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins, the first woman in the United States to hold a cabinet post, served throughout Franklin Roosevelt's presidency, becoming a leading advocate and author of New Deal legislation. Will Cotton's pastel muses playfully on the position of a professional woman in a man's world. Perkins devised her trademark costume-black hat, dark suit, and string of pearls-in order to appear formal, ladylike, and unthreatening. Cotton juxtaposes her pale, small face against a looming, earth-toned image of a laborer, but with her hand casually draped between mallet and cogwheel, Perkins confidently dominates the picture. The pink of her lipstick resonates with the red shirt behind her, perhaps gently hinting at the Communist sympathies some critics implied. But Cotton's portrait, commissioned by Vanity Fair in the mid-1930s, is more a spoof of her careful avoidance of gender stereotypes.  "
16660,"President Gerald R. Ford and Soviet general secretary Leonid I. Brezhnev participated in the Helsinki summit conference of 1975, which ratified accords reached earlier by the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. These renounced the use of force to settle disputes among European countries and recognized the Soviet Union's territorial gains since World War II, an objective that the USSR had been trying to achieve for at least thirty years. Signed by the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union, and all of the countries of Eastern and Western Europe, the accords also promoted Western aims of improving trading opportunities, implementing cultural exchanges, and adhering to human rights. This summit was considered one of the high-water marks of détente.  "
16670,"Seventeenth president, 1865–69     Born poor, Johnson’s talent for business gave him wealth. His gift for public speaking launched him on a successful political career leading to a Senate seat, from which he hoped to propel himself to the presidency. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln, in a gesture of unity, chose Johnson—a southern Democrat from Tennessee but a staunch defender of the Union—as his running mate. When Johnson succeeded to the presidency after Lincoln’s assassination in April 1865, it became clear that his view of Reconstruction clashed not only with Lincoln’s but also with that of the Republican majority in Congress: Johnson would allow southern states returning to the Union to deprive freed slaves of their rights. The resulting clash led to his impeachment, from which he survived conviction by only one vote.               Washington Cooper was a leading Tennessee portraitist, and Johnson sat for him on several occasions. Although this likeness is undated, Johnson’s apparent age suggests it was painted during his presidency. "
16702,"In the early twentieth century, when business leaders became the focus of national attention, J. Pierpont Morgan was the most powerful and influential of those American financiers. His banking empire had controlling or major interests in key railroads and industries, including U.S. Steel and General Electric. A directive from Morgan could influence the stock market, which happened in the panic of 1907, when he lent his prestige and collateral to help stabilize Wall Street. His gift was for consolidating businesses to make them more efficient and profitable. But Morgan also got along with ""trust buster"" president Theodore Roosevelt, who sought to regulate concentrations of wealth and power rather than break them up.   Morgan must have sat for the original version of this portrait by British artist Frank Holl during his annual spring visit in 1888 to his father, Junius S. Morgan, who lived in England.   "
16712,"Abraham Lincoln was Grant’s greatest supporter in official Washington, and he affirmed his backing whenever Grant’s leadership was questioned. At their first meeting, Lincoln stated simply that he would not interfere in Grant’s plans. He did not want or need a constant stream of reports but a general who would take “responsibility” for the war. Grant promised not to “annoy” the president and left for the field. This delightfully fictitious depiction of Grant stating his strategy shows the general addressing Lincoln while ringed by his new subordinates: the army generals William T. Sherman, Philip H. Sheridan, and George Thomas, as well as admirals David Dixon Porter and David Farragut. The “council,” set outdoors, with convenient rocks serving as chairs, never occurred in life; the portraits are taken from Brady photographs. However, the print is an effective way to show Grant taking command.   Consejo de guerra     Abraham Lincoln fue el mayor defensor de Grant en los círculos oficiales de Washington y afirmaba su respaldo cada vez que se cuestionaba el liderazgo de Grant. En la primera reunión que tuvieron, Lincoln declaró simplemente que no iba a interferir en los planes de Grant. No quería ni necesitaba un flujo constante de informes sino un general que asumiera ""la responsabilidad"" de la guerra. Grant prometió no “molestar” al presidente y salió hacia el campo.  Esta representación ficticia y con mucha gracia, en la que Grant indica su estrategia, muestra al general que se dirige a Lincoln mientras se encuentra rodeado por sus nuevos subordinados: los generales del ejército William T. Sherman, Philip H. Sheridan y George Thomas, así como los almirantes David Dixon Porter y David Farragut. El ""consejo"", que se encuentra al aire libre, con rocas bien situadas que sirven como sillas, nunca ocurrió en la vida real. Los retratos se extraen de las fotografías de Brady. Sin embargo, la litografía es una forma efectiva de mostrar a Grant que toma el mando.

16740,"Born Boston, Massachusetts     The first female cabinet member in the United States, Frances Perkins served as Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s secretary of labor from 1933 to 1945. Her early interest in activist causes such as the abolition of child labor and sweatshops led her to study economics and sociology at Columbia University. In 1911 she became the executive secretary of the newly formed Committee on Safety of the City of New York, where her work connected her to local assembly leaders. Her advocacy of legislative reform led Al Smith, governor of New York, to name her to the state’s industrial commission in 1919, where she was the highest-salaried female state employee in the nation. Roosevelt, Smith’s successor as governor, then named her to his cabinet when he was inaugurated president in 1933. She shaped policies of social responsibility such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, but also public works projects and the Social Security Act."

16777,"This cover photograph of President Ronald Reagan and Vice President George Bush illustrated an August 1984 story on the Republican National Convention, where the president and vice president were nominated for a second term. The title, Republican Encore-Coronation in Dallas, reflected a new Time poll indicating a ""buoyant national mood giving the president a comfortable early lead."" Because of an improving economy and stronger posture in the Cold War, voters judged Reagan better able than the Democratic nominee, Walter Mondale, to lower inflation, reduce unemployment, and deal with the Soviet Union. Although the Democratic Party made history by becoming the first major party to nominate a woman-Geraldine Ferraro-for vice president, the Time poll had voters preferring George Bush.

16828,"Humphrey Bogart remains the most iconic American male actor in history. Raised in an upper- class family and sent to private schools from which he was often expelled, Bogart was a natural rebel and showed more talent for playing gangsters and tough guys than leading men. During the Great Depression, he studied the vernacular speech and gestures of working-class men, and on the eve of America’s entry into World War II, he created a new heroic type—the cool, ethical rebel loner. As Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and as Rick Blaine in Casablanca (1942), Bogart embodied the snarky independence of the rugged individualist of American myth. As detective, criminal, or soldier, he projected inner command in High Sierra (1941), To Have and Have Not (1944), The Big Sleep (1946), and Key Largo (1948). Yet his best roles included star turns as psychopaths, journalists, or cops. Married to Lauren Bacall, who cut his on-screen toughness with her own sass, he made ""Bogart"" a global brand name for stoic resilience in the postwar era. "
16888,"Pound has the most controversial reputation of all modern American poets because of his actions during World War II. As a younger man, he wandered the world, but by the 1920s he had made his home in Italy, where he lived through World War II. Pound’s support of Italian fascism and his public broadcasts in support of the Axis powers earned him an indictment for treason in 1943. He was held in an Allied internment camp, during which he wrote the last great section of his Cantos, “The Pisan Chronicles.” In this section, Pound’s poetic journey turns into Dante’s descent into Hell, with the difference being that the poet did not escape. Declared criminally insane, Pound was confined in St Elizabeths Hospital in Washington, D.C., where he remained until 1958. He then returned to Italy, where he died in 1972. "
16935,"Careening from one hilarious escapade to the next, the comic team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy entertained countless movie audiences with their hapless and endearing antics. Laurel and Hardy each achieved some measure of success as individual performers, but it was their on-screen pairing by legendary film producer Hal Roach that transformed their careers. Between 1927 and 1932 the duo made more than sixty comedy shorts for Roach, successfully navigating the changeover from silent films to talking pictures. They marked their feature-film debut in 1931 with Pardon Us and a year later starred in The Music Box—the first film to win the Academy Award for Short Subject (Comedy). Rather than adhering to the typical straight man/fall guy comedic formula, Laurel and Hardy functioned as equally bumbling partners who teetered between conformity and anarchy to great comic effect. "
16936,"Of all the journalists covering World War II, the one most loved by rank-and-file soldiers was their own Stars and Stripes cartoonist, army Sergeant Bill Mauldin. No one understood their mud-caked and all-too-often perilous lot better. More important, the impish Mauldin had an uncanny ability in his chronicling of frontline woes to make soldiers chuckle, and even roar, over their hapless situation. His wry barbs, especially those directed at officers, heartily irritated the likes of General George Patton, who claimed they undermined army discipline. But in reality, those jibes may have advanced Patton's discipline concerns by providing soldiers with a harmless, vicarious outlet for venting their frustrations. After Mauldin's cartoons became syndicated in civilian newspapers, Americans at home took to him as much as did the enlisted man, and in 1945 he won a Pulitzer Prize."
17010,"Sarah Winnemucca was one of the ablest and most energetic advocates for Native American rights during the decade of the 1880s, a period replete with crises involving her tribe. The daughter of a prominent Northern Paiute chief, she learned English as a child and used her verbal skills to mediate diplomatic exchanges between Paiute leaders and government officials. Concerned about the mistreatment of Native peoples throughout the West, she delivered more than three hundred public lectures during an 1883 speaking tour in the East. That same year she also authored Life among the Piutes: Their Wrongs and Claims, a book that chronicled the abuses sustained by her tribe from corrupt government agents. Winnemucca used the resulting proceeds to found a school for Paiute children near Lovelock, Nevada. This photograph was created in Baltimore during a stop on her 1883 tour. "
17077,"Elvis Presley released hundreds of records throughout a career that spanned slightly more than two decades. He also starred in thirty-one feature films and two documentaries. He was photographed throughout his career, and images of him on film are part of the American visual experience. However, the King of Rock and Roll only sat for one portrait painter-Ralph Wolfe Cowan. Elvis sat for Cowan in 1969, and Cowan produced the portrait of Elvis that hangs today at Graceland. At the time, Cowan also made sketches for this portrait but left the sketches alone until 1988, when he completed this work. At the time this portrait was drafted-the late 1960s-Elvis was transitioning from making films to performing live; from 1968 until his death in 1977, he toured regularly. Of Elvis, Cowan said, he ""was funny and had charisma that was bigger than life. I enjoyed our friendship."" "
17094,"“Stand by your principles, stand by your guns.”    This tiny copy of Alexander Hesler’s 1857 “tousled hair” portrait was produced in 1860 so that it could be cut out, placed in a frame, and worn as a campaign pin or locket during the campaign. Such partisan political symbols had long been a staple of American elections, but the heated political climate of 1860—and the need for the Lincoln organization to mobilize all its supporters—led to a plethora of new and creative ways to energize a public immersed in the political culture of the time. Political participation and partisanship was a major source, probably second only to religion, of most Americans’ identity in the mid-nineteenth century. Wearing Lincoln’s likeness was a particularly personal way for good Republicans to flaunt their allegiance to both man and party as they joined in the public rituals of American politicking.   "
17111,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
17113,"In about 1965, when Jacob Lawrence began this self-portrait, his was the face of ""Negro art"" for white America. The 1941 exhibition of his epic painting cycle, The Migration of the Negro, had firmly established his reputation. Composition, color, and abstract pattern became the root of Lawrence's style as he painted the black experience. The human face, normally subject to powerful artistic conventions, was to him just another shape to be simplified or distorted.  With the exception of a small group of self-portraits that he made in the 1960s, Lawrence rarely attempted portraiture. In 1996, he updated this drawing, adding wide bands of black around the face and changing its contours to a single sweeping curve. Transforming a linear drawing into a muscular interplay of black and white, the portrait reflects both the strength and the anxieties of the artist's advancing age."
17216,"When Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, he realized that his executive decree was vulnerable to constitutional challenge in the courts. Moreover, in practical terms, his historic proclamation was only enforceable by the continual presence of federal troops throughout the South. A constitutional amendment outlawing slavery was needed. In his reelection bid of 1864, Lincoln risked his political survival and his place in history for this cause. ""Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish,"" he vowed, ""I give my heart and hand to this measure.""   On January 31, 1865, just two years after the Emancipation Proclamation took effect, Congress passed the Thirteenth Amendment, banning slavery. This composite picture depicts the members of Lincoln's administration and members of Congress who supported the amendment.  "

17246,"Although Andrew Oliver, a Massachusetts colonial officeholder of nearly thirty years' standing, regarded the Stamp Act as a ""public Misfortune,"" he agreed to accept the office of collector of stamps. After a mob swarmed over his garden, violated his house, and threatened his life, Oliver gave the impression that he would resign his post. When he did not, his effigy was hung from the Liberty Tree, the site of patriotic protest. While standing under the tree in the rain, Oliver was forced to swear that he would take no measures for enforcing an act ""which is so grievous to the People."""
17269,"This satirical sketch casts President Lincoln in league with the devil as he drafts the Emancipation Proclamation. Signed on New Year’s Day 1863, the proclamation freed all slaves in the Confederate states. The pictures on the wall purport to show Lincoln in sympathy with radical abolitionist John Brown and with the bloody slave revolt that took place in Santo Domingo at the turn of the nineteenth century."
17276,"Born Bergen Point, New Jersey    At the start of the Civil War, Samuel F. Du Pont was one of the navy's senior and most distinguished officers. Accordingly, he was given command of the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron, the largest fleet ever commanded by a naval officer up to that time. His capture of Port Royal, South Carolina, in November 1861 was the first major Union naval victory of the war and demonstrated the effectiveness of the navy's improved ordnance against shore defenses. The victory earned Du Pont the rank of rear admiral. In 1863, however, Du Pont, leading a fleet of ironclads, failed to take Charleston and suffered the worst naval defeat of the war. He asked to be relieved of his command and the request was granted, thus ending a forty-five-year career in the navy rather ignominiously."
17352,"Born New York City  In 1904 Theodore Roosevelt won the presidency in a landslide. Out of respect to the two-term tradition, he immediately announced that he would not run again, although, as he became president after William McKinley’s assassination in 1901, he would not have violated that tradition if he had run in 1908. Roosevelt was determined to break new paths after his presidency, even reverting to his title of ""colonel."" While president, the time he could devote to his interests in natural history, camping, and hunting in the wilderness had been severely curtailed; Roosevelt often complained about mobs of reporters following him around and his inability to get sufficient gunnery practice. He dreamed of a ""great adventure"" to Africa and began planning for the trip—perhaps using the globe in the background—in earnest during the last years of his presidency. "
17360,"Born Kansas City, Missouri  The Denishawn School combined Ruth St. Denis’s interest in Eastern mysticism and Ted Shawn’s belief in the Delsartian theory of body movement, which incorporated movements of the body to express emotional concepts. Shawn was particularly fascinated with American themes, which he introduced in such works as the Aztec dance-drama Xochitl, the Hopi ballet The Feather of the Dawn, and the celebratory O, Libertad!  When Denishawn dissolved in 1929, Shawn organized “Ted Shawn and His Men Dancers” to emphasize the importance of the male dancer. He founded Jacob’s Pillow Dance Festival in 1933, and in 1942 built the first theater in the United States to be used expressly for dance. As the resident impresario at Jacob’s Pillow, he pioneered the presentation of such important American dancers as Alvin Ailey, Arthur Mitchell, Carmen de Lavallade, and Geoffrey Holder.  Called “the father of American dance,” Shawn gave all dancers classic advice: “When in doubt, twirl.”"
17383,"Born Hale’s Ford, Virginia     In the face of segregation, disenfranchisement, and considerable racial violence, Booker T. Washington contended that it was unrealistic for African Americans to expect to gain entry into America’s white-collar professions. Instead, he suggested they establish themselves as a skilled laboring class. With that accomplished, racial discrimination would gradually disappear. In 1881 Washington put this theory to the test, becoming the director of Alabama’s Tuskegee Institute. As the school grew, he became viewed as the nation’s leading spokesman for African Americans. A magnetic speaker and the author of ten books, he attracted many critics, however, who contended that his “get along” philosophy undermined the quest for racial equality."
17511,"   Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Rubens Peale was one of the children of artist and naturalist Charles Willson Peale, who named most of his children after painters and scientists. Rubens was named after the seventeenth-century Flemish painter Peter Paul Rubens. Unlike his older brothers, Raphaelle and Rembrandt, Rubens did not become an artist but followed the family’s other business: operating museums of art and science. When his father retired, Rubens became manager of the family’s famous Philadelphia Museum. In 1825 he established his own Peale Museum in New York City and for a brief time also managed his brother Rembrandt’s museum in Baltimore.   This portrait by his older brother Rembrandt emphasizes Rubens’s eyeglasses (he was very nearsighted), as does his more famous 1801 painting, Rubens Peale with a Geranium (National Gallery of Art). "
17524,"Born Jacksonville, Florida    James Weldon Johnson was a Renaissance man: successful Broadway lyricist, poet, novelist, diplomat, and a key figure in the NAACP. In 1900 he collaborated with his brother to produce ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" a song that later acquired the subtitle of ""The Negro National Anthem."" President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Johnson consul to Venezuela and Nicaragua, where he served with great distinction. In the 1920s, Johnson became a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance, known for his anthology, The Book of American Negro Poetry; his work on African American religion, God's Trombones; and Black Manhattan, the first history of African Americans in New York City. As chief operating officer of the NAACP during that same decade, he helped formulate the strategy that would later overturn American segregation laws. The background of this portrait recalls ""Creation,"" Johnson's best-known poem in God's Trombones. "

17525,"Taking his seat as one of New Jersey's delegates to the Second Continental Congress on June 28, 1776, the Reverend John Witherspoon, president of the College of New Jersey at Princeton, was quick to answer a colleague who thought the country was not ready for independence. ""Sir, in my judgment the country is not only ripe for the measure,"" said Witherspoon in his heavy Scots burr, ""but in danger of rotting for the want of it."" A month earlier Witherspoon, a Presbyterian minister, had changed his mind about the propriety of the clergy preaching about politics, proclaiming from his pulpit, ""I willingly embrace the opportunity of declaring my opinion without any hesitation, that the cause in which America is now in arms, is the cause of justice, of liberty, and of human nature.""  "
17720,"The Civil War wore Whitman out both physically and emotionally. By 1872, he was in decline, in ill health, and living alone in Camden, New Jersey. His best work was behind him, yet he labored to spread and enhance his reputation, both in America and worldwide.   This caricature of Whitman appeared in the Fifth Avenue Journal, which was published every Wednesday in New York City for a brief period. Whitman is shown as he appeared in his poems, not as he was at the time: still out on the open road, still vigorous, and sporting a jaunty fedora instead of his usual slouch hat. He was as avid for self-promotion and public recognition as ever. Dr. Silas W. Mitchell wrote that Whitman ""was the most innocent and entirely vain creature I ever knew. The perfect story of his vanity will, I fancy, never be written. It was past belief.""  "
17994,"Born Allentown, Pennsylvania     Automobile executive Lee Iacocca introduced the iconic Mustang to Ford Motor Company’s lineup in 1964. An experienced salesman, Iacocca became the president of Ford in 1970. Despite being fired by Henry Ford II in 1978, Iacocca was hired by Chrysler Corporation to be its president and chief executive officer in 1979. As CEO, he rescued the company from financial distress through an unprecedented $1.2 billion loan from the federal government. This loan, accompanied with his memorable television commercial challenge—“If you can find a better car, buy it”—enabled Chrysler to pay off the loan in 1983, a full seven years early.  In David Levine’s caricature, we see Iacocca with a shattered lightbulb above his head. Perhaps representative of the groundbreaking ideas used to rescue Chrysler, this addition also highlights Iacocca’s skills as an inventive engineer and businessman."
17996,"This deathbed scene shows Abraham Lincoln inside the house of William Petersen, where he was carried after being shot in Ford’s Theatre, just across the street. The bedroom was small and would not have been capable of accommodating all of the visitors shown here. Rather, family members, doctors, and government officials trickled in and out as Lincoln lay unconscious. The president died at 7:22 a.m. on April 15, 1865."
18025,"Before the Civil War, few books rivaled Francis Parkman's The Oregon Trail in popularizing travel in the West. Published in 1849, during the height of the excitement surrounding the discovery of gold in California, The Oregon Trail chronicled an eight-month trip from St. Louis to Wyoming Territory that Parkman and his cousin Quincy Adams Shaw made in 1846. To Parkman, the son of a Unitarian minister, the West represented freedom and adventure. The book's romantic descriptions of their time chasing buffalo, interacting with frontiersmen, and meeting with members of the Lakota tribe promoted the idea that the West was a beautiful, yet untamed natural paradise. Parkman's family initially disapproved of his desire to become a historian, but the success of The Oregon Trail encouraged him to pursue this interest. His most substantial achievement-the seven-volume France and England in North America (1865-92)-owed much to this earlier experience traveling in the West."
18027,"Born New Orleans, Louisiana  A trumpet virtuoso with a wide smile and an ebullient personality, Louis Armstrong was a jazz pioneer who helped to transform that musical genre into an international phenomenon. In the process, he became one of the most beloved American entertainers of the twentieth century. Raised in New Orleans, Armstrong moved to Chicago in 1922 to join King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band. Several years later he formed his own band, billed himself as the ""World’s Greatest Trumpet Player,"" and helped to develop the jazz style popularly known as swing. His technical prowess, rhythmic ingenuity, memorable improvisations, and lively ""scat"" singing made Armstrong a standout. As Duke Ellington observed, ""Satchmo"" became the ""epitome of jazz"" as he played before capacity audiences across America and abroad. A consummate performer first and foremost, Armstrong modestly declared, ""I never tried to prove nothing, just always wanted to give a good show."""
18060,"De Witt Clinton, masterful politician of New York-in and out of office as mayor of the city and governor of the state-was a man who saw America with the potential for unlimited progress. His great dream was for a canal linking the Great Lakes with the Hudson River. When expected federal financing did not materialize, Clinton set out to put public pressure for funding on the state legislature. A bond issue was approved just in time for Clinton, newly elected as governor, to preside over the groundbreaking ceremonies on July 4, 1817. Eight years later, Clinton, returned to office, directed the great celebration of the Erie Canal's completion. ""Clinton's Ditch"" was a popular and immediate financial success and contributed enormously to the growth and prosperity of New York and the Northwest Territory as well.  "
18061,"When Americans chose their first president under the new Constitution of 1788, George Washington's election was a foregone conclusion. But despite Washington's prestige, his presidency had its critics. Toward the end of his administration, one newspaper branded him a ""scourge and misfortune."" This portrait shows some of the stress that even our first president felt under the burden of the office. Even under attack, however, Washington's firm leadership gave credibility to the new federal government and assured its survivability.  Young Rembrandt Peale, then seventeen, was so nervous about painting Washington that his artist father, Charles Willson Peale, had to come along to the sittings to soothe his son's jangled nerves. The younger Peale made several replicas of his resulting portrait, including this version."
18090,"President Theodore Roosevelt saved Edwin Arlington Robinson’s career and possibly his life—the poet was living a hand-to-mouth existence—in 1905 by giving Robinson a patronage appointment at the New York Customs House. The poet wrote that he owed Roosevelt “some of the most powerful loafing” that had ever come his way. Robinson appealed to Roosevelt because he was a throwback in terms of both style and subject matter. He avoided free verse and favored dramatic monologues on homey topics, which he infused with a sense of melancholy and sadness. Probably his most famous poem, “Miniver Cheevy,” was an ironic meditation on being out of step with time: “Miniver loved the days of old / When swords were bright and steeds were prancing; / The vision of a warrior bold / Would set him dancing.” It is not known if Roosevelt got the irony or just took away the horses prancing. "
18133,"In 1784, the much-admired French sculptor Jean-Antoine Houdon agreed to execute a full-length marble statue of George Washington for the Virginia State Capitol in Richmond, and he traveled to America the following year to make a life mask of his subject. In addition to serving as an aid in completing the final marble statue, the mask became the basis for many plaster and terra-cotta busts of Washington, including this one. Houdon fashioned the first of these smaller likenesses while still in the United States, and before returning to France he presented it to Washington. The marble statue took some ten years to complete and still resides in the Virginia Capitol."
18175,"Cinqué was the slave name given to Singbe-Pieh by the Spanish who illegally enslaved him and fifty-one others in 1839. While sailing to Cuba, Singbe-Pieh led a successful mutiny of the slave ship Amistad. But the Africans then had to rely on a Spanish helmsman, who steered the ship to Long Island instead of back to Africa. The Amistad was secured by U.S. authorities, and the slaves were interned in New Haven. While the federal government, fearful of offending the South, wanted to recognize the law of property and return the slaves to their owners, the District Court in New Haven ordered them freed. When the government appealed, ex-president John Quincy Adams defended the Amistad prisoners before the Supreme Court, successfully arguing that the right of habeas corpus prohibited their illegal seizure. Singbe-Pieh and his fellow captives were returned to Africa.  "
18185,"Samuel Seabury, portrayed here shortly after his consecration in 1784 as the first bishop of the Episcopal Church in America, styled himself as ""A. W. Farmer"" (A Westchester Farmer) when he entered the pamphlet war in 1774 on the side of conciliation with Great Britain. Denouncing with force and wit the Continental Congress's nonimportation, nonexportation, and nonconsumption agreements, Seabury (rector of St. Peter's Church in Westchester, New York), urged citizens to proclaim ""that you are Englishmen, and will maintain your rights and privileges, and will eat, and drink, and wear, whatever the public laws of your country permit, without asking leave of any illegal, tyrannical Congress or Committee on earth."" In November 1775 Seabury, having in other ways made himself ""obnoxious"" to the patriots, suffered a month's imprisonment. He subsequently slipped behind British lines and served as chaplain to the King's American Regiment.  "
18286,"In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fulfilled a campaign promise to appoint the first woman to the U.S. Supreme Court by nominating Arizona lawyer and judge Sandra Day O'Connor to a seat on the bench. After announcing the nomination, Reagan wrote in his diary, ""Already the flak is starting and from my own supporters. . . . I think that she'll make a good justice."" O'Connor served from 1981 to her retirement in 2006 and left a reputation as a conscientious associate justice, one inclined toward narrowly based judgments rendered on a case-by-case basis, thereby avoiding setting sweeping precedents. A lifelong Republican, O'Connor came to the court after a career in the law and politics in both Arizona and California, where she had attended Stanford University. Her career, and her appointment to the Court, signaled the growing political importance of the Sun Belt after World War II.    This likeness ran on the cover of Time shortly after Reagan announced O'Connor's Supreme Court nomination."
18379,"Henry Cabot Lodge exuded the confidence and haughtiness that his New England ancestry, wealth, and influence bestowed. He became a powerful senator and one of the Republican Party's most respected, if not loved, leaders. Lodge joined his close friend Theodore Roosevelt in calling for the United States to increase its navy and assume a larger role in world affairs. When war broke out in Europe in 1914, he supported American neutrality but believed that Germany was the aggressor. Concerned that U.S. security would be endangered by a German victory, he became increasingly angry with President Woodrow Wilson for not strengthening America's armed forces. Lodge successfully spearheaded the Senate's rejection of the Treaty of Versailles over the issue of the League of Nations. While he did not object to an international organization, he viewed the league as a threat to American sovereignty.  "
18380,"The great American Republic must be a republic in fact as well as form, wrote economist Henry George. As American industry after the Civil War spawned undreamed-of wealth for some and a new and excruciating poverty for others, George became a leading voice in efforts to reform the nation's free-enterprise system. His stinging yet highly popular critique of American capitalism, Poverty and Progress (1879), described with great eloquence the inequities in modern society. According to George, poverty's root cause lay in ever-rising land values. Levying a heavy ""single tax"" on those values would, he asserted, undermine monopolies, distribute wealth more evenly, and eliminate poverty. Although George failed in his attempt to win elected office, his writings found widespread support, especially within the burgeoning labor movement.  "
18399,"Born Fairview, Kentucky  While traveling in the United States in 1849, English-born artist George L. Saunders painted this miniature of the future president of the Confederacy, Jefferson Davis. At the time, Davis was a senator representing Mississippi. A few years afterward, a contemporary recorded this impression of Davis: ""His slender, tall and erect figure, his spare face, keen eyes and fine forehead . . . presented the well-known strong American type. There was in his bearing a dignity which seemed entirely natural and unaffected, that kind of dignity which does not invite familiar approach but will not render one uneasy by lofty assumptions."""
18410,"Born Fairview, Kentucky  ""The man and the hour have met,"" announced the Alabama secessionist William L. Yancey when Jefferson Davis was elected president of the Confederate States of America in February 1861. Davis, a former U.S. senator and secretary of war, was a reluctant secessionist, hoping that the South would remain loyal to the Union. But when the secession movement gained momentum in early 1861, he dedicated himself to its cause. As president of the South’s hastily formed government, Davis faced the twin difficulties of repelling invading northern armies and appeasing southern states’-rights advocates who challenged his efforts to build a unified Confederate nation. "
18411,"Born Ulm, Germany  As early as 1930, Davidson planned to portray German theoretical physicist Albert Einstein, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. After Einstein immigrated to America in 1933, Davidson made the portrait at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. During sittings, Einstein discussed a complex mathematical problem with his assistant, Walther Mayer. Einstein and Davidson doubtless also discussed European politics. The following year, Davidson sent him a check to assist European Jews. On Davidson's death in 1952, Einstein wrote, ""His passing will be keenly felt as an impoverishment of public life in this time of distrust towards all non-conformists."""
18548,"Shortly after President George H. W. Bush was elected in 1988, Communist governments began falling throughout Eastern Europe, and East Germany dismantled the Berlin Wall. The United States had achieved one of its central Cold War objectives: a Germany and Europe ""whole and free."" Although Ronald Reagan's strategy helped propel these events, Bush was presiding when the Cold War actually ended, not with a bang, but upon the ruins of a disintegrating empire unable to confront a resurgent and confident America, and a rising tide of freedom in Eastern Europe. In 1990, Bush announced: ""We have closed a chapter of history. The Cold War is over.""  "
18581,"In 1928, when Baker was visiting Vienna on a world tour, Hungarian artist Tibor Gergely made this unusually pensive sketch of her."
18591,"Love is the chain whereby to lock a child to its parent     Lincoln had three sons at the beginning of his presidency. Although he had a complicated relationship with his eldest son, Robert, Lincoln was very close to his younger boys, Willie and Tad. Lincoln was an extremely indulgent father, much to the chagrin of his wife and some of his staff. He overlooked his mischievous sons' many pranks, which included ringing all of the call bells in the White House at once. Lincoln found great relaxation and calm when he was with his children. In 1862, Willie died suddenly of typhoid fever, and in the wake of this tragedy, Lincoln and Tad became inseparable. Tad was often seen in his father's lap at meetings or sleeping in Lincoln's office while his ""papa dear"" worked into the night. Lincoln lavished Tad with affection and became protective of his free-spirited and often rambunctious son."
18615,"In 1960 Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson had believed that his national prominence and power base in the Senate would win him the Democratic nomination for president. After Kennedy won the nomination, he surprised everyone by offering Johnson the vice presidency-and Johnson surprised the political pundits by accepting it. Kennedy hoped that Johnson would balance his ""Yankee Roman Catholic"" image and give him Texas, a prognosis borne out in one of the closest presidential elections in American history. Kennedy later acknowledged the role reversal, admitting, ""I spent years of my life [as a senator] when I could not get consideration for a bill, until I went around and begged Lyndon Johnson to let it go ahead."" Kennedy's aides often ridiculed Johnson as ""Uncle Cornpone,"" but the president always spoke of him with respect, placing him in charge of the administration's space exploration initiative. "
18616,"Born New York City  Pete Seeger was America’s ringing voice of protest in a career that spanned labor rallies in the 1930s and 1940s, anti-McCarthyism in the 1950s, the civil rights and anti-Vietnam movements of the 1960s, and the Occupy Wall Street campaign of 2011.   Seeger’s songs of purpose included the civil rights anthem “We Shall Overcome,” which he adapted from old spirituals, and the antiwar song “Waist Deep in the Big Muddy.” In 1950 he organized the Weavers, whose hit “Goodnight, Irene” reached number one on the charts. Blacklisted for his leftist politics in the 1950s, Seeger resurfaced in the 1960s and sparked a folk revival with such classics as “If I Had a Hammer,” “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?” and “Turn! Turn! Turn!”  Seeger recorded more than 100 albums, and Smithsonian Folkways has released a five- CD collection honoring the artist who captured “the social upheavals and transformations” of our time."
18659,"Grover Cleveland’s election in 1884 made him the first Democratic president since the Civil War. His 414 vetoes during his first term set a record and established him as a strong president in an era otherwise dominated by Congress. In a more than symbolic assertion of executive power, Cleveland initiated the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act, which gave the Senate control over executive appointments. His foreign policy was also indicative of a strong presidency. He refused to acquiesce to demands by Americans in Hawaii to annex those islands, calling the U.S. military’s involvement in overthrowing its queen ""an abuse of power."" In 1895 he warned the British not to interfere in a boundary dispute involving Venezuela because the ""United States is practically sovereign in the Western Hemisphere."" Cleveland was the only president to serve nonconsecutive terms.   This is Eastman Johnson’s earliest image of Cleveland and was made while Cleveland was governor of New York. "
18675,"Jo Davidson was a gifted sculptor and a charming raconteur. But when President Woodrow Wilson allowed Davidson a series of sittings in June 1916, the artist, declaring ""it takes two to make a bust,"" had to prompt the president's interest in the portrait by having Wilson sit on the back of an armchair, feet on the seat, to force him to chat with the artist rather than read. One reviewer noted that this bust ""is a perfect likeness. Davidson has got all the firmness of the face, without any of that sourness by which some artists unconsciously and mistakenly make people think they would not care to know President Wilson personally.""  "
18676,"In the early stages of the 1976 presidential campaign, the experts hardly gave a second thought to Jimmy Carter's chances of winning the Democratic nomination, much less the White House. But the former Georgia governor's ""can-do,"" Washington outsider's image, along with his traditional populism, had great voter appeal, and in the final poll he emerged triumphant. Unfortunately, Carter did not prove as popular in the presidency as he had on the stump, being blamed for problems such as runaway inflation. Nevertheless, his administration had some unalloyed successes, including a landmark peace agreement between Egypt and Israel, which would probably never have been reached without Carter's own dogged determination to make it happen.  Artist Robert Templeton made the first sketches for this portrait at the White House in 1978. In the picture, Carter stands in the Oval Office, which is furnished as it had been during his administration. The donkey statuette on his desk was a gift from the Democratic National Committee.  "
18684,"Lee never wrote his memoirs and was reluctant to talk about the war, let alone the political issues of Reconstruction and reunion. He lost his citizenship and never regained it, despite petitioning the government after President Andrew Johnson issued an act of amnesty and pardon; it was posthumously restored in 1975. Materially, he lost his and his wife’s ancestral home in Arlington, which was taken over by the Union and its property dispersed; the Custis-Lee Mansion is now part of Arlington National Cemetery. His wife’s mementos of her family and George Washington were confiscated and not restored to the Lees despite petitions to Congress. Lee tried to remain neutral or noncommittal in the disputes that arose between his former subordinates. Reticent to the end, he nonetheless never regretted going with his state when it seceded from the Union.   Robert E. Lee     Lee nunca escribió sus memorias y no le gustaba hablar sobre la guerra, menos aún sobre los temas políticos de reconstrucción y reunión. Perdió su ciudadanía y nunca la recuperó, a pesar de solicitarle al gobierno después de que el presidente Andrew Johnson sancionara una ley de amnistía e indulto; fue recuperada de manera póstuma en 1975. Materialmente, perdió su casa de origen y la de su esposa en Arlington, que fueron tomadas por la Unión y su propiedad se dispersó; la mansión Custis-Lee ahora es parte del Cementerio Nacional de Arlington. Los recuerdos de la familia de su esposa y de George Washington fueron confiscados y Lee no los recuperó a pesar de las peticiones al Congreso.  Lee intentó permanecer neutral o evasivo en los conflictos que surgieron entre sus antiguos subordinados. Reticente hasta el final, nunca lamento ir con su estado cuando se separó de la Unión.

18698,"Despite his personal distaste for slavery, Abraham Lincoln entered the presidency pledging to leave America’s ""peculiar institution"" untouched in those states where it existed. But by the summer of 1862, Lincoln had come to view the emancipation of all slaves within Confederate-held territory as both a military and a moral necessity. He shared a preliminary version of his Emancipation Proclamation with members of his cabinet in July, and released it publicly on September 22, 1862. Although Lincoln’s proclamation applied only to slaves within the rebellious states, Frederick Douglass declared that it had ""thrown a moral bombshell in the Confederacy."" When Lincoln signed the much-anticipated final version of the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863, it was widely regarded as ""the death-warrant of slavery.""   Produced to commemorate Lincoln’s historic edict, this decorative print includes the text of the Emancipation Proclamation, accompanied by contrasting images of war and peace, slavery and freedom."
18784,"“A tall, ill-favored man, with little grace.”    In 1861, the elegant Bostonian Charles Francis Adams characterized Lincoln in the quotation above. Lincoln described himself  as “six feet four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing on average one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair and gray eyes.”  Seemingly  ungainly, Lincoln was physically strong, easily winning such frontier tests of strength as wrestling or holding a large axe parallel to the ground. Lincoln’s physical prowess helped him to connect with ordinary working Americans.  "
18810,"During the summer of 1860, an acquaintance between Elmer Ellsworth and Abraham Lincoln, the Republican Party presidential candidate, began developing into a genuine friendship in Lincoln's hometown of Springfield, Illinois. Ellsworth worked briefly in Lincoln's law office, assisted with the fall campaign, and became an adviser to Lincoln after he won the election. In late February 1861, he was among the select group of aides who escorted Lincoln by train to Washington for his inauguration. Afterward, he was a guest of the first family at the White House. Lincoln lobbied the War Department-unsuccessfully-to detail Ellsworth for special duty as adjutant and inspector general of militia. After the president's proclamation of April 15, 1861, requesting 75,000 state militia, Ellsworth realized his opportunity and hastened to New York City, where he began recruiting a regiment of Zouaves from the ranks of the volunteer fire departments."
18849,"Often called the father of documentary film, Robert J. Flaherty began filming native life while exploring the Hudson Bay region in the late teens. In 1920 a fur-trading company funded his filmmaking, and the result was Flaherty's classic documentary, Nanook of the North (1922), which depicted an Eskimo (Nanook) hunting, fishing, and trapping. Flaherty's subsequent documentaries included Moana (1926), a depiction of Samoan life, and Tabu (1931), which took place in the South Seas and won an Oscar for Best Cinematography. As much a showman as a filmmaker, Flaherty helped popularize the idea of motion pictures as a chronicle of everyday life."
18850,"In 1883 the Northwest celebrated the completion of the Northern Pacific Railroad, America's second transcontinental railroad. To mark the achievement, company officials-led by the Northern Pacific's president, Henry Villard-organized an elaborate ceremony at the location in Montana where the rail lines from the East met those from the West. This photograph shows a group who attended the festivities. Villard is seated at the center with a hat on his knee. A German immigrant who worked as a journalist during the Civil War, Villard became interested in the transportation industry after studying railroad bonds for a group of German investors. In 1881, hoping to build a rail and steamship empire in the Northwest, Villard assumed control of the Northern Pacific, which had struggled financially since it was first chartered in 1864, and led the effort to complete the line's construction."
18942,"Born Augusta, Kentucky    Born into a slave-owning family, James A. Thome became convinced of the moral iniquity of slavery while a divinity student at Lane Theological Seminary in Cincinnati. Thereafter, he helped craft the radical abolitionist message that slaves had to be granted immediate and unconditional freedom.  Thome worked as a traveling agent for the American Anti-Slavery Society, and he also investigated conditions in slave societies to provide documentary evidence against slaveholders' arguments that slavery was a positive good. In 1839 Thome fled Ohio, where he was teaching at Oberlin College, when he was threatened with arrest for assisting a runaway slave. He went to Connecticut, where he was portrayed by the artist and abolitionist Nathaniel Jocelyn. Thome is shown holding a copy of Theodore Weld's American Slavery As It Is (1839), to which he had contributed much of the primary research. "
18980,"Born New Kent County, Virginia    In 1749, Martha Dandridge married Daniel Parke Custis, the wealthiest planter in the colony. Seven years and four children later, she was a very wealthy widow. She married George Washington in 1759, pulling him upward in Virginia's social and economic strata. Martha was viewed by contemporaries as a quiet, reserved woman capable of managing an estate, a comfortable fit for an ambitious planter. She contributed to her husband's climb to national leadership in numerous ways. During the Revolutionary War, Martha stayed with her husband in the army's winter encampment; she was a great comfort to George and a major factor in his being able to keep the army intact. She was also, along with her husband, influential in setting the atmosphere and tone of the presidency, which was so important to the new republic.    Rembrandt Peale based his portrait on his father's (Charles Willson Peale's) 1795 likeness, adding a ""porthole"" as he did in his George Washington on view across the room. "
19019,"On the eve of the battle of Gettysburg, July 1–3, 1863, President Lincoln appointed General George G. Meade commander of the Army of the Potomac. In this photograph of generals from that army, Meade stands fourth from the right. Although Gettysburg was a badly needed victory for the Union, Lincoln was distraught that Meade did not pursue Lee’s retreating and crippled army and crush it once and for all. Meade contended that his army needed rest and refitting, and days of torrential rains hampered his efforts to mobilize an effective pursuit. Meade would keep his command to the end of the war, but in 1864 Ulysses Grant became general-in-chief of the army and chose to make his headquarters with Meade’s troops, which essentially pitted Lee against Grant on the fields of battle and in the realm of American memory."
19025,"The son of Russian Jewish immigrants, Joseph Davidson was outgoing and gregarious. Portraiture became ""an obsession"" for this talented sculptor, who often sought out sitters whose achievements interested him. In the 1930s he began to use his talents to support liberal political causes. He helped to form the Independent Voters Committee of the Arts and Sciences for Roosevelt, in 1944, noting that President Roosevelt ""laughingly said to me, 'Jo, have they called you a Communist yet?'"" After the Second World War, the committee joined with others to form the Progressive Party."
19049,"Whitman admired the effect of this photograph by George Cox, calling it The Laughing Philosopher. He sent a copy to Alfred, Lord Tennyson, poet laureate of England, who responded that he ""liked it much-oh! so much.""    "
19050,"The birth of photography in 1839 provided a new means of recording and disseminating likenesses of America's presidents. The first photographic method employed for this purpose was the daguerreotype, which yielded mirrorlike images remarkable for their detail and sense of immediacy. Soon, sophisticated portraits of presidents emerged from the studios of such daguerreotypists as Mathew Brady or Southworth and Hawes. As one-of-a kind objects produced without the use of negatives, original daguerreotypes of the presidents enjoyed only limited circulation. But reproduced as wood engravings in illustrated newspapers or as popular prints, these images reached countless Americans who could never have hoped to see their president in person.  "
19212,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
19319,"Born Brooklyn, New York  When American troops set off to fight in World War II, many of them carried a pinup photograph of negilgee-clad Rita Hayworth that had appeared in an August 1941 Life magazine. It became an iconic wartime image, selling more than five million copies. Her beauty also had such general appeal that she became the image for Woodbury Cold Cream.  Hayworth began her career performing with her father as “The Dancing Cansinos,” but by the early 1940s she had emerged as a Hollywood star in such films as The Strawberry Blonde (1941), Blood and Sand (1941), and You’ll Never Get Rich (1941). With Cover Girl, a 1944 Technicolor musical that co-starred Gene Kelly, Hayworth became a top box-office star.  Gilda (1946) solidified Hayworth’s image as “The Love Goddess.” After World War II young scientists put the name “Gilda” on the first nuclear bomb detonated at Bikini Atoll—a salute to Hayworth’s popularity as a “bombshell” film star."
19432,"By her early seventies, Anna Moses was no longer active in running her family's farm in Eagle Bridge, New York, and she was looking for other ways to fill her time. At first she tried embroidery, but arthritis made holding the needle too painful. She discovered, however, that her fingers did just fine with a brush, and in 1938, she began creating pictures depicting idyllic scenes of a rural past she had once known. The flat, naive quality of these works embodied a charm capable of winning over even sophisticated viewers. By 1940, the art world was coming to know their maker as ""Grandma"" Moses, and over the next two decades she would become America's best-loved painter.  In the late 1940s, Moses visited New York City, where she told reporters that ""the city doesn't appeal to me."" ""As picture material?"" someone asked. ""As any material,"" she answered."
19435,"When Time ran its cover story about consumer advocate Ralph Nader in December 1969, seemingly all of America knew his name, and many recognized his face. Nader would periodically appear on nightly news broadcasts with one of his campaigns about making safer cars, producing healthier foods, and reducing air pollution or anything that might potentially be harmful to the public. “To many Americans,” reported Time, “Nader, at 35, has become something of a folk hero, a symbol of constructive protest against the status quo.” A relentless crusader and indefatigable worker, Nader enlisted a small army of vacationing college students to assist him—staffing telephones and canvasing lawmakers—in advancing his many causes. Nader’s 1965 book, Unsafe at Any Speed, first brought him national recognition. It was a scathing critique of the auto industry, particularly of the Chevrolet Corvair depicted at the bottom of the painting.   Ralph Nader  nacido en 1934     Cuando Time publicó en diciembre de 1969 su historia sobre el activista defensor de los consumidores Ralph Nader, al parecer todo el país conocía su nombre y muchos reconocían su cara. Nader aparecía periódicamente en los noticieros nocturnos con alguna campaña a favor de automóviles más seguros, alimentos más saludables o reducción de la contaminación ambiental u otro factor con potencial dañino para el público. “Para muchos estadounidenses”, reportaba Time, “Nader, a sus 35 años, se ha convertido en una especie de héroe del pueblo, un símbolo de la protesta constructiva contra el statu quo”. Activista tenaz y trabajador incansable, Nader reclutó un pequeño ejército de universitarios que durante las vacaciones lo ayudaban a contestar teléfonos y promover sus causas entre los legisladores. Su libro Unsafe at Any Speed, publicado en 1965, fue lo primero que le valió reconocimiento nacional. Se trata de una feroz crítica a la industria automotriz, en particular al modelo Corvair de Chevrolet, que aparece en la parte inferior de la pintura.      George Giusti (1908–1991)  Pintura y tinta sobre cartón, 1969  Portada de Time, 12 de diciembre de 1969"
19480,"Time’s cover of Pope Paul VI was noteworthy, stated Bernhard M. Auer in his weekly “letter from the publisher” on September 24, 1965. “For the first time, in this issue,” he wrote, “Time’s cover is based on a work of sculpture.” This decision, in part, was consistent with the magazine’s efforts to project a more modern look with the selection of artist Robert Berks. This issue appeared on the eve of Pope Paul’s visit to address the United Nations, marking the first time a pope had ever crossed the Atlantic.  Papa Pablo VI  1897–1978     La portada que dedicó Time al papa Pablo VI fue memorable, según comentó Bernhard M. Auer en su “carta del editor” para la semana del 24 de septiembre 1965. “En esta edición, por primera vez en su historia, [...] la portada de Time está basada en una escultura”. La decisión coincidía con los esfuerzos de la revista por proyectar una imagen más moderna y la consiguiente selección del artista Robert Berks. Esa edición se publicó en vísperas de la comparecencia de Pablo VI ante la Asamblea de las Naciones Unidas, primera vez que un papa cruzaba el Atlántico.     Robert Berks (1922–2011)  Bronce, 1965  Portada de Time, 24 de septiembre de 1965 "
19490,"In 1876 newly elected President Rutherford B. Hayes selected Carl Schurz to head the Department of the Interior. A former reform-minded senator from Missouri, Schurz inherited a position that had been rife with controversy during the previous administration. In particular, corruption was rampant throughout the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the War Department was  eager to take away oversight of this agency from the Department of the Interior. Schurz resisted and consequently succeeded in changing public perceptions regarding the Indian Bureau. Having immigrated to America as a young man, Schurz believed strongly in assimilation, and he used his position to promote the acculturation of Native Americans. He also continued to support their relocation to reservations, a policy that he saw as vital to their ""progress"" but which drew much criticism.     "
19569,"“Now bring out your father and I will make a picture of him . . .”    Photographer Henry F. Warren got this shot of the president by taking some candid pictures of Tad Lincoln riding his pony. When Warren delivered the prints to the White House on March 6, 1865, he asked Tad to go get his father so he could take the president’s picture. Lincoln obliged, bringing a chair out onto the south balcony for the sitting, but was not pleased with how the photographer had ambushed him. Lincoln looks very severe in what was to be the last photograph taken of him.   "
19570,"In the early years of his career, Thomas Hart Benton was among the young painters drawn to abstraction. He soon rejected that brand of modernism, however, and emerged in the 1920s as a leader of the regionalist school of realism, whose primary concern was the portrayal of local life and history in America. Best known for his panoramic murals, Benton brought to his works a boldness of composition that led one critic to describe him as ""the most . . . vigorous and virile of our painters."" Benton made this portrait of himself and his wife, at Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts during the first year of their marriage. In the course of their residence there, he later recalled, ""I really began to mature my painting."" The monumentality of its muscular figures anticipates his later work."
19637,"John Quincy Adams's tenure as James Monroe's secretary of state ranks among the most productive in the history of that office. But Adams's often tactless ways were ill-suited for the presidency, and when his vision for such items as a comprehensive national transportation system met with hostility in Congress, he would not compromise. As a result, his administration's accomplishments were meager.  But Adams was not through with political life. Elected to the House of Representatives in 1830, he served there until his death. In his prolonged and successful struggle defending the antislavery movement's right to petition Congress, ""Old Man Eloquent"" had gained a circle of admirers that extended well beyond his Massachusetts constituency.  When Adams sat for this portrait, he doubted that artist George Caleb Bingham could produce ""a strong likeness."" But Bingham did just that, and the portrait's vitality seems to echo Ralph Waldo Emerson's comment that the aging Adams was ""like one of those old cardinals, who as quick as he is chosen Pope, throws away his crutches and his crookedness, and is as straight as a boy."""
19752,"   Born Chicago, Illinois  Brought up in what he described as the stifling atmosphere of a repressed Midwestern family, the young Hugh Hefner decided his life’s work would be to overthrow the ""puritanical"" roots of American life. Scraping money together to purchase nude photographs of Marilyn Monroe, Hefner launched Playboy in 1953. His timing was impeccable, and the magazine, although never becoming completely respectable, took off. Hefner hit the sweet spot between America’s growing consumer culture and an increasingly public tolerance for a frank avowal and depiction of (female) sexuality. Playboy signaled the shift from a culture of production to one of consumption. Style became something you could purchase, and Playboy became a reliable guide for young men looking for the best stereo, liquor—or woman. Ironically, despite Hefner’s intentions, Playboy was not really a rebellion against American society but a refashioning of it in a new—and expanded—postwar marketplace."
19810,"In 1843 ex-slave Isabella Van Wagener obeyed God's personal command to her, changed her name to Sojourner Truth, and became an itinerant preacher. Quickly becoming a major attraction on the revival circuit for the power and ingenuity of her prophetic speeches, she was drawn into abolitionism and entranced antislavery audiences with her personal testimony. Like Frederick Douglass, Truth was a charismatic figure because she was not a victim but a leader. She was also a powerful example of African American womanhood. As she concluded in a compelling oration on women's rights, ""I could work as much . . . and bear the lash as well [as a man]-and aren't I a woman?"""
19815,"William Zorach and his wife, Marguerite, who drew this portrait, shared an artistic partnership that lasted throughout their long marriage. After meeting in Paris in 1911, they returned home to establish themselves as American modernists, settling in New York and various rural summer retreats. Both sought to express the inner spirit of their subjects and find the essential relationship of forms to universal themes. They designed expressionist stage sets and often showed their fauvist- and cubist-inspired paintings together in New York galleries. William eventually concentrated on sculpture, advocating ""direct carving"" on wood or stone without preliminary modeling. Although his reputation would exceed hers, Marguerite often drew or influenced the designs for his sculptures. She also made prints and boldly colored embroideries. Her expressively distorted portrait drawings show her understanding of modernist stylization as well as her interest in American folk art."
19848,"Carte-de-visite portraits of Confederate generals  During the Civil War, the Union blockade of southern ports effectively halted the flow of most goods, including materials needed by Confederate photographers to continue their operations. Although some photographic supplies were smuggled through, by January 1862 it was reported in the North that ""the Photographic Art down South has completely died out in consequence of the war."" Because southern cameramen had virtually nothing to work with, photographs representing Confederate leaders, such as these portraits of generals Simon Bolivar Buckner, Braxton Bragg, and Albert Sidney Johnston, typically circulated in the form of retouched copy images produced in the North by such firms as E. & H. T. Anthony rather than as original life portraits created in the South."
19877,"Born Florida, Missouri    ""His fame is imperishable,"" wrote the New York Times at the time of Samuel Clemens's death one hundred years ago this April. Using the pen name Mark Twain, Clemens had become one of this country's favorite satiric writers by the early 1870s, routinely making light of everyday human foibles. But it was the publication of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) that assured him a lasting place in American letters. Inspired in part by his own boyhood, these two tales set along the Mississippi River did more than capture the rhythms of youth in antebellum America. In these and other novels, Clemens examined with sardonic wit different tensions that underlay contemporary society, including the question of race. In later years, his success in this country and abroad was tempered by financial and personal setbacks and by a contempt for American and British imperialism."
19905,"Ernest Hemingway is one of the most important writers of the twentieth century and one of the few novelists to achieve worldwide celebrity, as much for his outsized persona as his writings. Trained as a newspaperman to write in a tightly controlled style, Hemingway went to Paris after World War I to hone his craft. Part of the large crowd of expatriates who helped make Paris the cultural capital of the world, Hemingway wrote and mingled with such literary lights as Scott Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein, as well as ordinary (and some extraordinary) Parisians. His first novel, The Sun Also Rises (1926), rendered his experiences in a lean, objective prose that was instantly recognizable as modern and new. Hemingway lived in Paris with his first wife, Hadley. Here he is shown with their son John, in a portrait by the well-known American photographer Man Ray, who lived in Paris from 1920 to 1940."
19908,"Theodore Roosevelt was nominated as William McKinley’s vice president in 1900 because New York’s Republican leadership wanted to ease the brash, reform-minded governor out of state office. Meant to sideline Roosevelt, the move backfired when McKinley was tragically assassinated. An accidental president he might have been, but once in office Roosevelt grasped the reins of government with both hands. Delighting in the “bully pulpit” of the presidency, Roosevelt set a model for activist presidencies that continues to this day. Fame was a constant spur to Roosevelt, and, appropriately, Sally Farnham sculpted him in profile relief. The style harkened back to Renaissance profile sculptures that heroicized notable citizens. Farnham had been urged to become a sculptor by Frederick Remington, whose own work celebrated the West that Roosevelt loved."
19934,"In the face of racial hatred, segregation, and disenfranchisement, it was unrealistic, Booker T. Washington contended, to expect African Americans to gain entry into America's white-collar professions. Instead, he suggested they establish themselves as a skilled and indispensable laboring class. With that accomplished, he believed, racial discrimination would gradually disappear. In 1881 Washington put this theory to the test, becoming the director of the newly created Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. As the school grew, he became viewed as the nation's leading spokesman for African Americans. A magnetic speaker and the author of ten books, including a moving autobiography, Up from Slavery (1901), Washington worked closely with such national leaders as Theodore Roosevelt and Andrew Carnegie. Although well respected, he attracted many critics, including W. E. B. Du Bois, who contended that his ""get along"" philosophy undermined the quest for racial equality.  "
19945,"Like Calder, Paolo Garretto presents a seemingly airborne likeness of Babe Ruth. Garretto airbrushed Ruth's spherically shaped head and stylized cap to simulate an actual baseball; he then cut out the head and ""floated"" it on the page. By eliminating the traditional sculptural base and detaching the head from his body, both Garretto and Calder have created disembodied portraits that seem as buoyant as the baseballs that Babe Ruth sent soaring out of the stadium again and again. By thus referencing the baseball itself, both artists found an ingenious way to represent the Home Run King."
19950,"Inspired to try his hand at writing mysteries after his years with the Pinkerton Detective Agency, Dashiell Hammett met a warm reception when he published his first two detective novels in 1929. But it was the appearance of The Maltese Falcon a year later that secured him his reputation as one of America's most original mystery writers. The hard-bitten realism and crisp dialogue of that work led critics to compare its author's style to that of Ernest Hemingway. Hammett's later books, The Thin Man and The Glass Key, drew similar accolades. In defining the main difference between Hammett's works and the far more common drawing-room detective stories of the period, one admirer observed that Hammett had taken murder ""out of the Venetian vase and dropped it into the alley,"" where, after all, it more generally occurred in real life.  "
20004,"President George Washington chose John Jay to be the first chief justice of the United States. Jay had played an important part in negotiating the treaty bringing the Revolution to a close, and was the postwar secretary of foreign affairs. An advocate for a stronger national government, Jay had helped persuade New Yorkers to ratify the Constitution, contributing five newspaper essays to the series that became known as the Federalist Papers.   In 1794 when war with England threatened, Washington sent Chief Justice Jay to London to defuse the crisis. The treaty that Jay negotiated, which Jeffersonian Republicans seized upon as a repudiation of America's wartime alliance with France and a return to English dominance, set off the cry of ""Damn John Jay."" Nonetheless the controversial Jay Treaty avoided a war that the young republic was ill-equipped to wage."
20155,"It is unfortunate that Anne Sexton’s career is so closely shadowed by that of Sylvia Plath. Both studied with Robert Lowell, both wrote poetry that ripped the scab off what it meant to be a woman in the 1950s, and both committed suicide in midlife. Sexton’s verse was not so much ""confessional"" as it was psychotherapeutic: a way to work out in language the traumas of the past and those of day-to-day living. Even more than Plath, her verse is raw and aching. Worst of all, it didn’t work as a therapeutic strategy. Eight years after writing a poem called ""Wanting to Die,"" she made the sad mistake of all suicides: hoping that her breath could be liberated by its stopping."
20157,"Born Great Barrington, Massachusetts     In 1903 W.E.B. Du Bois famously declared that “the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line.” Having received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1895, Du Bois applied his extraordinary intellectual energies to studying the question of race in America. The author of more than twenty books, he was also an activist and helped to found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1910. Du Bois came to oppose the policy of racial accommodation favored by Booker T. Washington, insisting that African Americans actively promote the quest for full civil and political rights."
20158,"Born Mayesville, South Carolina  The fifteenth of seventeen children born to her formerly enslaved parents, Mary McLeod Bethune believed deeply in education as the main route out of poverty for herself and other African Americans. In 1904 she founded the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute—a school for black girls in Daytona, Florida. By 1929 that institution had blossomed into Bethune-Cookman College. But perhaps Bethune’s greatest impact came in the mid-1930s with her service as an adviser for the New Deal’s National Youth Administration, which had been established to aid the jobless youth of the Depression. She used her position as a platform to become a powerful voice against racial discrimination throughout the federal government. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an order in 1941 requiring equal consideration for African Americans seeking jobs in the government and in the nation’s defense industries, there was little doubt that Bethune’s lobbying had played a major role in bringing it about. "
20187,"A poet, critic, magazine editor, and novelist, Lincoln Kirstein above all played a central role in shaping America's classical ballet tradition. Obsessed with dance from an early age, Kirstein brought choreographer George Balanchine of Russia's Diaghilev Ballet to the United States in the early 1930s, and together they founded the School of American Ballet. Their collaboration continued, and in 1948 they established the New York City Ballet, with Kirstein serving as general director until 1989. He also founded the Dance Archives of the Museum of Modern Art, which became the basis of the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library. The portraitist, Jamie Wyeth, was only nineteen when this painting was completed."
20223,"Born Chicago, Illinois  One of the stalwarts of American comedy throughout much of the twentieth century, Jack Benny started his career at age seventeen, playing a violin in vaudeville theaters for $7.50 a week. Later he became a national presence with his own radio show, The Jack Benny Program, which ran on NBC from 1932 to 1948 and on CBS from 1949 to 1955. Benny crafted what would become a unique and endearing comic persona of a penny-pinching miser who prided himself on playing the violin badly and whose perennial age was always thirty-nine. He was a master of comic timing and could garner laughs from ""either a pregnant pause or a single expression, such as his signature exasperated ‘Well!’"" He was supported by a loyal cast of comic cohorts, including his devoted wife, Mary Livingston. Benny successfully made the transition to television in 1950 and enjoyed a fifteen-year run."
20228,"Signed by the Boston Red Sox in 1914, the muscular six foot, two inch, 150-pound Babe Ruth was a gifted pitcher who helped the Sox win championships, but in 1919 he shifted to the outfield to utilize his even more impressive skills as a batter. The next year, the Yankees paid the Sox $125,000 for Ruth, an enormous sum for the time. In his first year as a Yankee, Ruth hit an astonishing fifty-four homers, more than any team in the American league. In 1923-the first season played in Yankee Stadium (""the house that Ruth built"")-he batted .391, with 41 home runs and a .500 percent on-base percentage, and led the Yankees to their first of many World Series victories. Ruth's home-run records have been eclipsed, but many view him as the greatest who ever played the game.     William Auerbach-Levy's caricatures of New York's notables appeared in many major newspapers and magazines, such as The New Yorker, Esquire, and Collier's."
20278,"Born Memphis, Tennessee    Mary Church Terrell's determination to encourage the development of self-help and social service programs among black women resulted in her founding and presiding over the National Association of Colored Women in 1896. But her life was also dedicated to the achievement of equity for all. Terrell's influence quickly spread across the nation as she eloquently addressed audiences and composed numerous articles, poems, and short stories, which often embodied the themes of race and gender equity. Her autobiography, A Colored Woman in a White World, was published in 1940. In Washington, Terrell served on the D.C. Board of Education for more than ten years and participated in numerous protests to end segregation in restaurants, hotels, and theaters in the city."
20312,"Wilshire Bowl Restaurant mural designs (studies #2)  John Decker—caricaturist, portrait painter, Hollywood personality, and friend of many actors—was a firsthand witness to the emerging star system of the 1920s and the transition from silent pictures to the ""talkies."" Decker created these vivid panels as mural studies for the Wilshire Bowl Restaurant, a popular Hollywood nightspot. Installed in 1941, the original murals, now lost, portrayed the sweep of film history, from the Keystone Kops and the ""Perils of Pauline"" to the film idols of the 1930s. The top panel shown here depicts such titans of the silent era as Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Harold Lloyd, William S. Hart, and Gloria Swanson. The bottom panel includes Joe E. Brown, Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, W. C. Fields, Mae West, and George Arliss, many of whom had started their careers in silent movies."
20345,"Born Okayama, Japan       Japanese-born artist Yasuo Kuniyoshi immigrated to the United States as a teenager and began his early training on the West Coast before moving to New York City. During the 1930s, he worked for the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration and began teaching at the Art Students League in 1933. Despite his decades in the United States, he was classified as an enemy alien following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Kuniyoshi remained opposed to Japanese militarism, even doing work for the U.S. government’s propaganda office. After the war he shifted his style and subject matter to reflect his conflicting feelings and loyalties about the outcome of the war. This photograph was taken after World War II, around the time he became the first president of Artists Equity and shortly before his one-person show at the Whitney Museum, its first exhibition devoted to a living artist."
20460,"Born Highland Park, Illinois  Edward Weston took up photography when he was six years old and went on to become one of the most important photographic artists of the century. A high school dropout, he described his passion: ""I needed no friends now—I was always alone with my love."" Weston’s long and productive career saw him range across the history of American photography, moving from soft-focus romantic attempts to replicate painting to the maturing of a modernist aesthetic that emphasized stark, sharply focused images. Weston’s personal life was as tempestuous as his artistic engagements, and he left a detailed record of both in his daybooks, a running commentary on his life. Such was Weston’s temperament that he destroyed his earlier work when he made the shift to a modernist emphasis on pure form, seeking ""the very substance and quintessence of the thing itself."""
20483,"The “Athenaeum” portrait    Gilbert Stuart painted this portrait of Martha Washington at the same time he did that of the president. Both paintings were commissioned by the Washingtons. They were never completed, however, and the artist kept them in his possession until his death. Although Stuart made many copies of the president’s portrait, no other likeness of Martha Washington by Stuart is known to exist. "
20499,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
20506,"Born Rochester, New York  Ballet visionary Lincoln Kirstein can be credited as much as anyone for creating a uniquely American ballet tradition. When an American dancer moved, Kirstein argued, he expressed “his legible freedom, springing in space” and evoked “the irrepressible and indomitable instinct to human liberty.”  When he first met George Balanchine, Kirstein wrote a friend: “We have a real chance to have an American ballet in three years’ time. . . . Do you know George Balanchine?” Kirstein and Balanchine created the School of American Ballet in 1934, a company that evolved into the New York City Ballet in 1948. Kirstein served as that company’s general director from its inception until 1989, with Balanchine and Jerome Robbins as founding choreographers.  Kirstein shaped a ballet tradition that resonated with the American experience. To his biographer Martin Duberman, he had a rare talent—an alchemy—that “achieved magic in American awareness.”"
20551,"As Great Britain's prime minister during World War II, it fell to Winston Churchill to cement his country's wartime alliance with the United States. The son of an American mother and an English father, he ultimately came to personify that alliance, and his wartime eloquence and shrewdness endeared him nearly as much to Americans as to his own countrymen. In recognition of his special place in the story of Anglo-American relations, Congress made him an honorary citizen in 1963.  Early in 1945 Churchill met with his two allies, Franklin Roosevelt and Joseph Stalin, at the Russian town of Yalta, where they reached agreements on strategies for the last phases of World War II. To commemorate the event, Roosevelt suggested that artist Douglas Chandor portray the trio at the conference table. The painting was never completed, however, because Stalin refused to sit for it."
20569,"As a young artist Georgia O’Keeffe often chafed at others’ expectations of her and the art she was then creating. She had little interest in painting only those subjects deemed suitable for women. Instead she experimented boldly with abstraction and immersed herself in the hothouse of American modernism. Fiercely independent, O’Keeffe dressed and acted as she pleased, forging relationships on her own terms, most famously with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz. Although they married in 1924, O’Keeffe sought space to pursue her art unencumbered by societal expectations. Beginning in 1929, she left New York and her husband nearly every summer to paint in New Mexico and moved there permanently after his death. Inspired by the Southwest landscape, she cultivated one of the most successful artistic careers of the twentieth century. While often living far from urban centers, O’Keeffe attracted many admirers, the majority of whom she sought to keep at a distance, including the photographer Paul Strand, the creator of this 1918 portrait."
20614,"In January 1926, when Stein was fifty-two years old, she cut off the long hair she had worn for decades and adopted a distinctive “Julius Caesar” bob, along with a more masculine style of dress that publicly expressed her lesbian sexuality. Soon after, Man Ray asked Stein if he could update his publicity images of her. For the photo shoot, Stein slicked her short hair back over her ears and wore makeup and a dark dress with a scarf and pin; Man Ray played up her gender-bending, showing her as a man in a woman’s body—or conversely, a female in male drag. He minimized her body and hands and lit her head and profile so that they read as solid and stony, in effect simulating the busts of ancient Roman rulers. When Man Ray asked Stein in 1930 to pay him for a recent sitting, they parted company. Money had never been part of their exchange."
20762,"George Washington, appointed commander-in-chief of the Continental army, took command of a ragtag force of some 17,000 men in July 1775. He kept an army together for the next eight-and-a-half years-losing more battles than he won-but effectively ended the war with his victory at Yorktown in October 1781. Mission accomplished, Washington-a hero who could have been king-resigned his military commission before Congress on December 23, 1783, and retired to Mount Vernon. Here, the man all artists yearned to portray posed in his Continental army uniform for English artist Robert Edge Pine and wryly observed, ""I am so hackneyed to the touches of the Painter's pencil, that I am now altogether at their beck, and sit like patience on a Monument."""
20797,"Born Boston, Massachusetts    John Singleton Copley, proclaimed John Adams, is “the greatest Master, that ever was in America.” While still a teenager, Copley was capable of satisfying Bostonians’ desire for realistic portraits; by the time he was twenty, the essentially self-taught artist was painting better pictures than he had ever seen. Frustrated by the limitations of his provincial environment, where people, he complained, generally regarded art as “no more than any other useful trade,” Copley longed to go to Europe to study. Increased political turmoil in the wake of the Boston Tea Party of December 1773—his father-in-law was one of the merchants who were supposed to receive the tea dumped in the harbor—spurred his departure for England in June 1774. There, in the flush of new success, he painted his own likeness. He never returned to America."
20888,"Created during Pocahontas's travels in England with her husband, John Rolfe, this engraving depicts her in English garb. Through its portrayal of the Indian princess, the print suggests that the New World could be seamlessly integrated into the British empire. The inscription provides both her Native American name, Matoaka (Pocahontas was a nickname meaning ""playful one""), and her Christian name, Rebecca, and identifies her father, Prince Powhatan, as the emperor of Virginia. The engraving is in Bazilioologia: A Booke of Kings (1618), a collection of portraits of British monarchs and notables, attesting to the admiration Pocahontas generated among her contemporaries."
20901,"In the early twentieth century, Mary Pickford was the most famous woman in the world. Her screen popularity from such films as Tess of the Storm Country (1914) and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) made her ""America's sweetheart,"" but she was also a shrewd businesswoman who cofounded United Artists (1919) and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences (1927).   Born Gladys Smith in Toronto, she came to the United States with her family in 1901. She worked with Broadway impresario David Belasco-who changed her name to Mary Pickford-and also began appearing in movies. From 1913 to 1919, she was the leading female star of silent films.   Pickford led the Hollywood war effort during World War I, selling bonds and making such films as Johanna Enlists (1918). An honorary colonel, she exhorted departing troops: ""Don't come back ?til you've taken the germ out of Germany!""  "
20908,"In May 1964, slain civil rights leader and World War II veteran Medgar Evers was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery as his widow, Myrlie Evers; the couple's children; and hundreds of mourners looked on. A committed activist for justice, Medgar Evers became the NAACP's field secretary for Mississippi in 1954 and was spearheading a multifaceted campaign to end segregation in the state capital of Jackson when he was felled by rifle fire from white supremacist Bryon de la Beckwith on June 12, 1963. Arrested for Evers's murder, Beckwith bragged about the killing but was freed when all-white juries deadlocked after two trials in 1964. Myrlie Evers never abandoned hope that her husband's killer would be brought to justice, and the case was reopened in 1990 largely due to her efforts. This time, Beckwith was convicted and sentenced in 1994 to life in prison."
20954,"Born Germantown, Pennsylvania  Louisa May Alcott began writing as a young child and turned her facility into a career in her teens when her father, utopian theorist Bronson Alcott, left her family in dire financial straits. Helping to support her family, she published her first book, Flower Fables, in 1854. She served as a nurse during the Civil War, and her memoir Hospital Sketches was published in 1863. Asked by her publisher to write a book for girls, Alcott drew upon her own family experiences to write Little Women (1868). This heartwarming novel chronicles the lives of the four March sisters—Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy—as they grew up during the Civil War. A success upon its publication, Little Women remains an American literary classic, its popularity so engaging that it has been adapted several times for the silver screen and Broadway."
21023,"Born Ripon, Wisconsin     Carrie Chapman Catt's organizational talents are credited with making the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA) an effective force in winning the struggle for women's right to vote. In NAWSA, she worked with such leaders as Susan B. Anthony to win the franchise state by state, and also for a constitutional amendment. Initially condemning America's flood of immigrants, whom she believed were influenced by their paternalistic Old World cultures to vote against women's suffrage, Catt eventually discarded such xenophobic simplifications, founded the International Woman Suffrage Alliance, and became a crusader for internationalism and world peace. In 1900 she replaced Anthony as president of NAWSA and was again elected president in 1915, leading the organization during the successful passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920, which guaranteed all American women the right to vote.   "
21140,"  In 1916 Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the first woman elected to serve in the U.S. Congress. Before her milestone victory, Rankin had gained valuable political experience traveling widely on behalf of the campaign for women's suffrage. During her congressional race, she made support for this issue-together with child protection and national prohibition-the foundations of her platform. Rankin served two nonconsecutive terms and was the only member of Congress to vote against the country's entry into both world wars. In 1918 she lost her bid for election to the Senate in part because of her unpopular stance on the war. A lifelong pacifist, Rankin opposed all war ""because we've never settled any dispute by fighting."" Her political success owed much to the opportunities afforded many women in the West during this period."
21172,"Born Killeen, Texas  By her early thirties, Oveta Culp Hobby had helped to codify the banking laws of her native Texas, been an assistant to Houston’s city attorney, and served as an editor and executive vice president of the Houston Post. When this portrait appeared on Time’s cover in 1944, she was the commanding officer of the Women’s Army Corps, charged with directing one of this country’s first experiments in utilizing women in the military. The experiment was succeeding overall, and the performance of Hobby’s WACs had long since disputed the initial spate of cynical remarks about women’s unfitness for the military. Hobby’s one disappointment was that the numbers of WAC enlistments had fallen well short of the army’s original hopes. In 1953, and largely in recognition of her organizational skills, President Eisenhower appointed Hobby to head the newly created Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. "
21212,"Born Redding, Connecticut     An intellectual and diplomat, Revolutionary War veteran Joel Barlow spent many years abroad. In 1787 he wrote “The Vision of Columbus,” one of the first epic poems celebrating American progress. William Dunlap, an artist and dramatist, traveled the East Coast beginning in 1805, painting miniatures to support his family. According to family letters, he met Barlow in February 1806 in Washington, D.C. This signed and dated portrait contrasts the richness of the dramatic background with Barlow’s carefully depicted features."
21292,"A pivotal figure in the creation of the modern conservative movement in America, William F. Buckley played a significant part in the movement's most important successes: the 1964 presidential nomination of Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan's presidency. Buckley's message-that liberalism was not America's inevitable historical direction-was carried in his journal, National Review-with its bold attempt to ""stand athwart history, yelling, 'Stop!'"" For the next half century, he was a ubiquitous figure in American life, writing more than fifty books on topics ranging from politics and the harpsichord (which he played well) to spy novels and his beloved sailing adventures. He wrote a twice-weekly newspaper column, estimated to total 4.5 million words, and hosted one of television's longest-running programs, Firing Line. Although many opposed him, it was hard to deny his influence. "
21399,"When the venerable John Marshall posed for William James Hubard-a silhouette artist lately turned to oil painting-he had been chief justice of the United States for some three decades. The momentous decisions firmly establishing the judiciary as a coequal branch of the government were now behind him. Moving into his late seventies, Marshall contemplated retirement, a time when he would ""read nothing but novels and poetry,"" but a fear that President Andrew Jackson would appoint a successor who would tear the Constitution to shreds had stayed his resignation. Jackson would outlast him, but Marshall's legacy-embodying a strong nationalism and respect for property rights-shaped the future of the country. The Liberty Bell in Philadelphia cracked when tolling his death."
21400,"The Byrds  Nothing galvanized the youthful counterculture of the mid-1960s like rock music. The Byrds, a group originating in Los Angeles, brought to the scene an influential folk-rock style, fusing contemporary folk music with energetic Beatles-like harmonies and a driving twelve-string guitar sound. Their debut single, “Mr. Tambourine Man,” had topped the charts in 1965. This poster from 1966, featuring band members David Crosby, Roger McGuinn, Michael Clarke, and Christopher Hillman, advertised the Byrds’ appearance at one of impresario Bill Graham’s famous concerts at San Francisco’s Fillmore Auditorium. The Fillmore posters designed by Wes Wilson, with their offbeat colors and sinuous letters, successfully evoked the multisensory experience of many such events, which were often charged with high-decibel music, light shows, frenetic movement, and mind-expanding drugs. The words “Fly 8 Miles High,” using the title of the Byrds’ new hit single, herald the psychedelic rock era."
21416,"Sportswriters routinely reached for superlatives to describe the play of Willie Mays. An All-Star for twenty consecutive seasons, Mays was a marvel of power, speed, and agility, whether he was patrolling the outfield, swinging a bat, or looking for a chance to steal a base. He signed with the New York Giants in 1950, when he was nineteen, and during more than two decades in the major leagues, he accrued records in hitting and fielding that place him among the best all-around players in baseball history. Twice named as the National League's most valuable player, Mays hit 660 home runs and recorded a career batting average of .302. A natural leader, he provided the spark that carried the Giants to many of their most memorable victories, and in 1961 he became the first African American to captain a major league team.  "
21419,"When Texas-born singer Janis Joplin (1943–1970) joined the San Francisco band Big Brother and the Holding Company in 1966, she propelled the group to the top of the rock scene. A passionate, bluesy singer with a raw, powerful voice, Joplin electrified audiences with her sexualized performance style, delivered with explosive movements and wailing, whispering, and shrieking. One writer described her as a ""mixture of Leadbelly, a steam engine, Calamity Jane, Bessie Smith, an oil derrick, and rot-gut bourbon."" Before her 1970 death of a drug overdose at age twenty-seven, Joplin had become a female rock icon.  The distinctive lettering and vivid colors of the psychedelic rock posters helped launch a poster collecting craze. As advertising images, portraits of film and music celebrities, and political propaganda wallpapered bedrooms and dorm rooms, the poster became a statement of one’s personal affiliations and a visual symbol of the era."
21503,"When ex-California governor Ronald Reagan began his presidency in 1981, his warmth and skill in handling the media had already planted the seeds of his reputation as the ""great communicator."" More significant, however, was how those traits were made to work on behalf of his conservative agenda. By the end of his second term, despite widespread concern over budget deficits and several administration scandals, Reagan's presidency had wrought many significant changes. Under his leadership, the nation had undergone major tax reforms, witnessed a significant easing of relations with the Communist world, and experienced a sharp upturn in prosperity. Reagan left office enjoying a popularity that only a few of his outgoing predecessors had ever experienced.  This portrait is based on some thirty studies that artist Henry Casselli made of Reagan over four days at the White House in late 1988. Commissioned with the National Portrait Gallery in mind, the finished picture arrived at the White House the following January for presidential inspection. When Reagan saw it, he exclaimed, ""Yep! That's the old buckaroo."""
21577,"    I am nature!    With this bold affirmation, the painter Jackson Pollock, like Whitman before him, conflated himself and his art with nature itself. From plumbing the depths of human nature in his explorations of the subconscious, Pollock evolved his famous ""drip"" paintings, in which paint was flung, dribbled, and slashed onto huge horizontal canvases in a form of visual free verse that recalls Whitman's breaking of traditional poetic formats. When painting, Pollock listened to jazz by musicians like Charlie Parker, seeking always, like Parker, to dissolve artificial visions between artist and art. Pollock wrote that his technique helped him achieve this: ""On the floor I am literally 'in' the painting.""     Author: D. Ward"
21598,"This portrait of Abraham Lincoln was taken on February 24, 1861, just before his inauguration on March 4. It has been conjectured that Lincoln is hiding his right hand in his lap because it was swollen from shaking so many hands during his travel from Illinois to Washington. This is also the first studio image depicting Lincoln with a full beard, which he had famously grown between the election and inauguration, purportedly at the behest of a little girl who wrote him from New York that it would improve his appearance. Lincoln was early to recognize the power of the relatively new medium of photography to mold and shape a public persona. He credited a photograph by Mathew Brady, taken when he came to New York City to present himself to Republican Party power brokers, as helping to confirm his suitability for the presidency by showing him well-dressed and dignified. Interestingly, the Brady photograph shows Lincoln standing; in this portrait he is seated, as if ready to begin work as president."
21603,"As general-in-chief, Grant decided to make his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac. Wary of Washington, D.C.’s propensity for political intrigue and clear-eyed about his own abilities, Grant knew that his strength was commanding an army in the field. He also had great confidence in William T. Sherman and knew that he did not need to micromanage that general’s campaign in the Southeast. He was not as sure of the Army of the Potomac’s leadership, although he treated its commanders, especially George Gordon Meade, the victor at Gettysburg, with respect. When Grant moved south he announced that his overarching plan “was to concentrate all the force possible against the Confederate armies in the field.” Fighting would now be continuous until the end of the war.  This lithograph rather fancifully shows Grant on the attack. More typically, during battle he would sit or stand quietly, issuing terse orders while frequently smoking or whittling.  Ulysses S. Grant     Como general en jefe, Grant decidió hacer su cuartel general con el Ejército del Potomac. Desconfiado de la tendencia de Washington, D.C. a la intriga política y perspicaz sobre sus propias capacidades, Grant sabía que su fuerza era estar al mando de un ejército en el campo. También tenía gran confianza en William T. Sherman y sabía que no necesitaba controlar demasiado la campaña de ese general en el sudeste. No estaba tan seguro del ejército de liderazgo del Potomac, a pesar de que trataba con respeto a sus comandantes, especialmente a George Gordon Meade, el vencedor en Gettysburg. Cuando Grant se trasladó al sur, anunció que su plan general “era concentrar toda la fuerza posible contra los ejércitos confederados en el campo”. La lucha sería ahora continua hasta el final de la guerra.                  Esta litografía muestra de una forma bastante fantasiosa a Grant al ataque. Generalmente, durante las batallas, estaba sentado o de pie, tranquilamente, y daba órdenes concisas mientras que por momentos fumaba o tallaba.

21660,"Bobby Hull sparked professional hockey's huge popularity boom in the United States in the 1960s with his electrifying displays of power and speed on the ice. Nicknamed the ""Golden Jet,"" this fair-haired dynamo got his start with the National Hockey League's Chicago Black Hawks in 1958, and two seasons later led the team to its first Stanley Cup since 1938. Utilizing his superb upper-body strength, Hull turned the slap shot into the game's most devastating offensive weapon and routinely sent the puck streaking into the net at speeds exceeding 100 miles per hour. An excellent skater with legendary quickness, Hull was equally effective whether on defense or on the attack. In a sport known for rough play, he eschewed violence, noting, ""When you hit back, it's just for your own self-satisfaction. I get mine from putting the puck in the net."""
21695,"Clarence King-standing at right alongside three members of Josiah Whitney's Geological Survey of California-was a key figure in the scientific exploration of the West. A Yale-trained geologist, King crossed the continent on horseback in 1863, ending up in San Francisco, where he volunteered for the Whitney Survey. After three years mapping California's topography, King returned east and convinced Congress to sponsor an ambitious survey of the lands between the Sierra Nevada range and the Great Plains, through which the transcontinental railroad was meant to pass. The resulting six-year project elicited vital information that encouraged the expansion of mining and industrial development in the West. King also made national headlines during this period for exposing the ""Great Diamond Hoax,"" a fraudulent diamond-salting scheme perpetrated by two Wyoming land speculators. King later championed the creation of the U.S. Geological Survey and in 1879 became its first director."
21706,"The November 1963 assassination of the youthful and idealistic John F. Kennedy, who espoused civil rights, set the nation's eyes on the moon, and provided a tough stance against communism, shocked the nation and set the tone for a tumultuous decade. Published five years later, Andy Warhol's Flash portfolio combines press bulletins and photographs to chronicle the event as it unfolded. The black-on-black portrait that leads off this portfolio of fourteen prints powerfully evokes the nation's mourning for its fallen leader. The magenta portrait juxtaposes a cheerful, confident president with pictures of the presidential seal and of Jackie Kennedy smiling from the presidential motorcade in Dallas. Once commenting, ""I feel I'm very much a part of my times, of my culture,"" Warhol provides a compelling account of the tragedy of Kennedy's premature death, which still resonates today."
21769,"Forty-second President, 1993-2001    When Time put president-elect Bill Clinton on its Man of the Year cover for 1992, he was still an unproven quantity as a national leader. Despite whiffs of extramarital scandal and tales of his efforts to evade the draft during the Vietnam War, this governor of a politically unimportant southern state had not only managed to gain the Democratic presidential nomination against heavy odds; he had also unseated a popular incumbent in the final election. In Time's estimation, he had performed ""one of the biggest miracles in the history of U.S. politics.""  This photograph blocked out part of Time's familiar logo on the cover. As a result, the points of the mostly obscured ""M"" looked like devil's horns protruding from the back of Clinton's head. Readers-some amused, others irate-quickly pointed this out to the magazine, which in turn, declared that it had not intended to portray Clinton as the Antichrist.    Time cover, January 4, 1993"
21773,"  One of the most important poets of postwar America, Frank O'Hara was a leader in making American verse more intimate and personal. His style was direct and immediate, and his topics were generated from his day-to-day encounters with people and places. (O'Hara was a curator at the Museum of Modern Art and wrote poetry during his lunch hour.) His relaxed, humorous, and offhand style hid the deep seriousness with which he took his art and his subjects. His irony was instead a defensive mechanism, a tendency toward obliqueness that provided cover in a society that was threatening to gay men. O'Hara also kept much of his life hidden from his closest friends, while at the same time he allowed himself to become the subject of many of America's leading artists. The American realist Alice Neel captured O'Hara's distinctive profile, which she described as ""a romantic falconlike profile with a bunch of lilacs."" "
21829,"  Cecilia Beaux's portrait of Henry James was commissioned by their mutual friend Helena Gilder. It depicts James during his final trip to the United States, when he was recovering from a nervous breakdown and the death of his brother, William. At first, Beaux found James ""almost impossible to do. So delicate and spiritual in solid exterior."" Beaux reconciled the disparity of delicate mind and corpulent body by placing James's head high on the page and downplaying his torso. The drawing reflects Beaux's advice to her students: ""place the eyes at the moment they are most interesting, do not lose the first impression, look for the large planes of shadow on the head, and, since light falls like rain, look for the places on the head that would get wet."" James, much pleased, complimented the drawing's ""astonishing. . . economy of means.""  "
21869,"Born Independence, Missouri  Ginger Rogers won the Texas State Charleston Championship in 1925 at the age of fourteen and then promptly embarked on the vaudeville circuit. By 1928 she was playing the Paramount Theatre in New York City; two years later, she became a Broadway star in Girl Crazy (1930). Hollywood then beckoned, and she partnered in nine films with Fred Astaire, bringing a silvery glamour to Depression-era America in such movies as Gay Divorcee (1934) and Swing Time (1936). Other important films included Stage Door (1937) and Lady in the Dark (1944). She received a Best Actress Oscar in 1940 for Kitty Foyle. "
21943,"British actress Laura Keene was playing the lead role in Our American Cousin on the night President Lincoln was assassinated at Ford's Theatre. Keene had become a major theatrical attraction in New York City after her arrival in the United States in 1852. By the start of the Civil War, she had also demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for business as the first female theater manager in the country. Our American Cousin was one of her long-running successes, and she brought it to the nation's capital in the spring of 1865.  "
21958,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
22019,"A forerunner of the pop art movement, Robert Rauschenberg has shattered traditional assumptions about art through his all-encompassing approach to everyday objects and images. Comfortable with materials as diverse as magazines, mud, taxidermied animals, clocks, and radios, Rauschenberg has created paintings, prints, sculptural installations, and even dance pieces. As he explained, ""I [tried] to find ways where the imagery, the material and the meaning of the painting would be, not an illustration of my will, but more like an unbiased documentation of what I observed."" Winner of the 1964 grand prize for painting at the Venice Biennale, Rauschenberg became the first contemporary visual artist on Time's cover with this 1976 self-portrait. Using his characteristic technique of assemblage, he combines pictures of himself and various artworks with his pet turtle and a view from Captiva, Florida, where he maintains a studio."
22043,"Before Marianne Moore, female poets were outliers in the American poetical tradition. Poets like Hilda Doolittle (""H. D."") were known and respected up to a point but were largely pushed to the margins. Marianne Moore changed all of that. She wrote poetry that was wholly original and of obvious high quality; she could not be dismissed or condescended to. She also influenced subsequent poets, especially Elizabeth Bishop (seen elsewhere in this exhibition). Poetically, Moore exceeded Ezra Pound’s edict to ""make it new,"" concocting new verse forms—a line that seemed like prose but wasn’t, based in part on counting syllables—that she married to her close, empirical observation. In her ""manifesto"" poem, called ""Poetry,"" she begins: ""I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle. / Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers in / it after all, a place for the genuine."" Moore loved observing animals, especially at the zoo. And she was a devoted baseball fan, a pastime that most modernist poets would never have owned up to! Moore was also a charismatic figure at readings and literary gatherings, standing out with her distinctive tricorn hat. But her influence as a writer made her a trailblazer for the growing presence of women poets in American literature."
22073,"William McKinley’s (1843–1901) successes in both domestic policy (returning prosperity) and foreign affairs (the Peace of Paris, in which Spain ceded the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States) made his reelection almost certain. His first vice president, Garret Hobart, had died; McKinley was not enthusiastic about Theodore Roosevelt being on the ticket but bowed to Republican enthusiasm for the young New Yorker. The March 4, 1901, ceremony—held as usual at the east front of the Capitol—marked the centenary anniversary of the first inauguration in Washington.   Chief Justice Melville Fuller administered the oath of office while Roosevelt looked on. "
22112,"For Scottish-born naturalist John Muir, the unchecked exploitation of America's natural resources in the late nineteenth century was a tragedy. With his gifts for repartee, descriptive writing, and summarizing the essence of issues, he played a decisive role in protecting such areas of the American West as the Yosemite Valley, the Grand Canyon, and the Petrified Forest. Founder of the Sierra Club, active lobbyist, and author of numerous articles and such books as Our National Parks (1901), Muir became America's leading conservationist. During Theodore Roosevelt's presidency, he led the effort to preserve some 148 million acres of forest.  This portrait's pensive quality reflects Muir's lifelong preference for solitude. Of the urban environment, he once said, ""Often I thought I would like to explore the city, if, like a lot of wild hills and valleys, it was cleared of inhabitants.""  "
22133,"This portrait of Mathew Brady, his wife Juliet, and Brady’s sister Mrs. Haggerty was probably taken about the time of Brady’s marriage. Brady’s name has become synonymous in America with the daguerreotype and early American photography, to the point that early photographic images are almost automatically assumed to be by Brady. In the 1850s, he was at the midpoint of his career, having established himself both artistically and commercially as a photographer. By 1858 he would open a studio in Washington, to be managed by Alexander Gardner, possibly with money provided by Brady’s wife’s family."
22183,"During the Cold War, artist Ben Shahn and physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer both became targets of the House Un-American Activities Committee's anti-Communist suspicions. In Oppenheimer, the ""father"" of the atomic bomb, the intensely politicized Shahn found a perfect subject. Although widely acclaimed as a scientist, Oppenheimer was declared a security risk for his misgivings about the bomb.  Shahn made a number of drawings of Oppenheimer, all reflecting a sense of unease. Here, the rigid, vertical torso recalls gaunt medieval figures of saints and martyrs. The ragged, barbed quality of the line, a sharp-edged, almost painful presence on the page, transforms the portrait into a symbol of troubled humanity. Shahn's art ""has never lost its fighting edge,"" one critic wrote, ""its profound concern with justice and truth.""  "
22207,"Cecilia Beaux's self-portrait projects a well-placed self-confidence. Aware of the challenges facing her as a woman, she declared: ""When I attempt anything, I have a passionate determination to overcome every obstacle."" The first woman hired to teach at the renowned Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Beaux became one of the most admired portraitists of her generation. Heralded by fellow American artist William Merritt Chase as ""the best woman artist who ever lived,"" Beaux enjoyed numerous accolades. She received a gold medal from the American Academy of Arts and Letters for lifetime achievement, and she was one of the first Americans invited to contribute a self-portrait to the Uffizi collection in Florence. Although Beaux trained in France and showed her work internationally, her permanent residence remained in the United States, where she painted friends, family members, and numerous luminaries."
22241,"Charles M. Russell created paintings and sculptures that romanticized frontier life on the northern plains. Born into a wealthy St. Louis family, Russell eschewed a traditional career and as a teenager became a horse wrangler in Montana. He also pursued his childhood interest in the visual arts by sketching and painting his surroundings. Russell's depictions of life in Montana earned him the nickname ""the Cowboy Artist."" Even after he stopped going on cattle drives in 1893 to become a full-time artist, he continued to be regarded as an authority on the ""Old West,"" a period before railroads, reservations, and eastern tourists. Although he earned a national reputation, Russell increasingly felt despondent in his later years, once commenting that his wife Nancy ""lives for tomorrow, an' I live for yesterday."" This portrait shows Russell in his studio, absorbed in his work. "
22349,"The undisputed ""Father of American Football,"" Walter Camp introduced the innovative rule changes that transformed English rugby into a uniquely American game. Camp was a stellar player on the Yale football squad (1876-82), but his off-the-field contributions to the emerging sport were of even greater importance. A member of the Intercollegiate Football Association's rules committee for forty-eight years beginning in 1877, Camp spearheaded the initiatives that reduced teams from fifteen to eleven players and created the key position of quarterback. He instituted the line of scrimmage, suggested a system of downs to govern possession of the ball, devised the present-day point system, and is credited with developing the distinctive gridiron pattern of the playing field. In short, no one proved more influential than Walter Camp in shaping the structure of the modern game."
22393,"Mary Cassatt created this watercolor, one of her few self-portraits, around 1880, a year after she began exhibiting her work with the French impressionists. Cassatt used her art to address the many roles of the modern woman-as mother, as intellectual, and here, as professional artist. Although dressed fashionably, Cassatt is not content to be admired, but returns the viewer's gaze. Concealing her sketching surface from view, she playfully reverses expectations, suggesting that the artist is appraising the viewer. Strokes of green in the right background suggest wallpaper, while the wash of rich yellow at the left evokes the sunlight that pours over the artist's shoulders and casts her face into shadow. The bold strokes of Cassatt's drawing, emphasizing color, mood, and motion, celebrate her rapid touch and the modernity of her style. "
22474,"Born Pin Point, Georgia  President George H. W. Bush appointed Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court in 1991, making Thomas the second African American (after Thurgood Marshall) to serve on the Court. Raised by his grandparents in Savannah, Thomas briefly considered a religious vocation before attending Holy Cross and then Yale Law School. Influenced by conservative legal thinkers and writers, Thomas gravitated toward the Republican Party. After only a year on the federal bench, Thomas was elevated to the nation’s highest court. His confirmation hearings became a partisan flashpoint after a former employee, Anita Hill, accused him of sexual harassment. Thomas denied the complaint, and he was confirmed by a narrow margin. The issue remains a topic of contention in the political landscape. "
22475,"Born New Rumley, Ohio    In June 1861, George Armstrong Custer graduated last in his West Point class of thirty-four. Never a bookish soldier, Custer was keen to wield a sword in the Civil War, in which he served from beginning to end, from Manassas to Appomattox. Fearless and fortunate, Custer made the most of every opportunity of engaging the enemy. Promotions followed quickly, and at age twenty-three he became the youngest Union officer to wear a general's star. Before the war was over, he was donning a pair of stars and was commanding the Third Division of Philip Sheridan's cavalry corps. In the days just before Lee's surrender, it was Custer's men who played a supporting role in blocking the South's retreat near Appomattox. One of the white surrender flags was even presented to Custer himself. "
22494,"Lillian Wald grew up in an affluent German-Jewish community, attending private schools and destined for a life of ease. A chance meeting with a nurse opened ""a window on a new world"" and a lifelong career. While teaching home-nursing to immigrants in lower Manhattan, she underwent another life-changing experience after visiting a student's home and seeing the poverty and filth of the tenements firsthand. In 1895 Wald established the ""Nurse's Settlement House"" and then a visiting nurse service, both becoming nationally known. During the first decades of the twentieth century, Wald became a spokesperson for reform, including women's issues and race relations. She joined pacifists to keep America out of World War I, thus incurring the wrath of patriot groups, but continued her work, serving with the Red Cross and as chairman of an emergency council for curbing the 1918 influenza epidemic. According to friends, this portrait captured Wald with remarkable accuracy. "
22534,"Lucretia Mott was of the liberal wing of the Society of Friends (Quakers), and she received an early schooling in debate and oratory by traveling with her husband to Quaker meetings throughout the country. The Quakers were a major force in antislavery agitation, and Mott naturally gravitated to the issue, helping to found Philadelphia's Female Anti-Slavery Society. Mott held that women had a special position in the reform of society, and she soon began to consider women's rights as essential in furthering the reform platform. With Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she organized the Seneca Falls, New York, convention in 1848 that launched the women's civil rights movement in the United States. As she wrote: ""Let woman then go on-not asking favors, but claiming as a right the removal of all hindrances to her elevation in the scale of being.""  "
22575,"This sketch portrays Abraham Lincoln as Don Quixote, the errant knight in Miguel de Cervantes’s popular novel of the same name. Volck included it in his Great American Tragedians, Comedians, Clowns and Rope Dancers in Their Favorite Characters (c. 1864). Satiric symbolism infuses every aspect of this potent yet subtle drawing. The image of the president evokes the contemplative Lincoln photographed in Mathew Brady’s Washington studio in February 1861. Lincoln, holding a quill pen, has made a list of Union defeats; his inkwell is in the shape of an artillery mortar. His foot rests irreverently on a stack of books labeled ""Constitution,"" ""Law,"" and ""Habeas Corpus."" Beside the legs his chair lie a rail and an ax, allusions to his humble beginnings. Resting against the seatback is a John Brown pike, a symbol associated with abolition and anarchy."
22603,"“A hand,  steady and firm”     Despite Lincoln’s leadership, as the war ground on, casualties became enormous, and people despaired that the war might never end. By the middle of the summer of 1864, the public mood was such that Lincoln confided that it was “likely” that the administration would not be reelected. Only when General Sherman took Atlanta in September did the military and political atmosphere brighten.  "
22690,"Celebrity photographer Bill King took over the successful Blackglama campaign from Richard Avedon in 1972. When he photographed Shirley MacLaine, King and agency associate Peter Rogers decided in advance that they wanted a dance shot. Although MacLaine worked hard for the camera, according to Rogers, the perfect image was not easy to capture, especially as the actress insisted on wearing white majorette boots for many of the pictures. But she liked the final picture-without the boots-and it became one of the most popular Blackglama posters.   The Blackglama campaign, exploiting a heady mix of glamour and commerce, continued to sell coats throughout the next couple of decades. After its successful example, advertisers realized the compelling allure of celebrity figures, and advertising campaigns using sports and entertainment stars to promote products proliferated. "
22743,"Born Los Angeles, California  Born to an Irish American mother and a Japanese father, Isamu Noguchi became interested in sculpture while studying medicine at Columbia University in the 1920s. He worked at Constantin Brancusi’s studio in Paris and began sculpting portraits when he returned to New York City in 1929.  George Gershwin was an early patron, but Noguchi didn’t win widespread recognition until 1938, when he completed a large-scale sculptural entrance to the Associated Press building in Rockefeller Center.  Outraged over the treatment of Japanese Americans in World War II, Noguchi volunteered to be placed in an Arizona internment camp for seven months in 1942. While there, he sculpted a marble bust of Ginger Rogers, writing her that he wished “for one last sitting. . . . I hope you will like the way it has turned out.”   She did. Rogers showcased the sculpture at her home until her death, when it was acquired by the National Portrait Gallery."
22763,"Few players in basketball history have rivaled the talent and versatility of the NBA All-Star known to fans as ""The Big O."" Averaging upwards of twenty-five points per game during fourteen stellar seasons with the Cincinnati Royals (1960-70) and the Milwaukee Bucks (1970-74), Oscar Robertson amassed a career record of 26,710 points to become the top-scoring guard of all time. His superb playmaking and rebounding skills coupled with his phenomenal ability to sink baskets from virtually anywhere on the court, made him both a defensive weapon and an offensive threat. Although some of his achievements have since been equaled or exceeded, Robertson continues to hold one of the most remarkable records in all of pro basketball, for he is the only player ever to have double digit averages in scoring, rebounding, and assists-a ""triple-double""-throughout an entire season."
22775,"World War II marked radio's coming of age as a major purveyor of news to Americans, and no figure is more closely identified with that development than CBS commentator Edward R. Murrow. Based in London, Murrow began reporting the war well before the United States entered it, and many claimed that his newscasts on the German air blitz over England were a significant factor in reconciling Americans to the need for joining the struggle to subdue Hitler. Among Murrow's broadcasting assets was a rich baritone voice that vested him with an oracle-like authority. Equally important were an ability to condense his stories without distorting them and a knack for spotting the deExhibition scriptive details that gave his commentary its vivid particularity.   Murrow continued to distinguish himself in newscasting through the 1950s, and his enormous influence on other radio and television journalists is still evident today.  "
22820,"Born Thurso, Caithness County, Scotland     Arthur St. Clair attained the rank of major general during the American Revolution. He was again given that rank in the American army in 1791, only to retire in 1792 after his troops were defeated by Indian tribes in the Northwest Territory. St. Clair’s portrait was painted in oils by the French artist Jean Pierre Henri Elouis in Philadelphia, and may have been intended as the basis for an engraving for public view; this miniature was probably created at the same time, but as a private keepsake."
22862,"Born Newcastle-on-Tyne, England  Dr. Anna Shaw triumphantly presided over a spirited gathering of elated suffragettes as ""Madam Chairman"" of the National American Woman Suffrage Association’s forty-fourth annual convention. After a long struggle, women had gained the vote in several states. McLure’s Magazine sent noted illustrator Wallace Morgan to Philadelphia to document the historic event’s leaders—including Shaw—who announced to her audience, ""This, indeed, is the woman’s century, and the dawn of the real day of womanhood has just begun."" Morgan’s drawings accompanied veteran journalist Wallace Irwin and suffragette Inez Milholland’s article, ""Two Million Women Vote."" A stalwart suffrage leader and a determined feminist pioneer, Shaw held her gavel and took questions from the crowd with a serious expression punctuated by ""black commanding brows."" She was indeed a formidable presence. Shaw was the first woman ordained in the Methodist Protestant Church, in 1880; six years later she earned an M.D. from Boston University. "
22930,"This large engraving titled Union was published at the close of the Civil War, in about 1865. Presumably the picture celebrates the return of peace, the union of states, and the national leaders who contributed to winning the war. Yet in reality, this engraving is an altered version of a print first published in 1852, at a time of growing sectional strife that would soon lead to secession and war. The artistic alterations involved the replacement of several prominent southerners with northerners, most noticeably the figure of Senator John C. Calhoun of South Carolina with that of President Abraham Lincoln, shown in the center with one hand resting on the Constitution and the other holding a pen. Other prominent figures include General Winfield Scott, seated far left; Senator Henry Clay, seated center; and Senator Daniel Webster, standing beside the bust of George Washington."
22971,"A refugee from the anti-Semitic oppression of Hitler's Third Reich, Hannah Arendt came to the United States in 1940 and spent the next several years working as a freelance journalist and research director for the Conference on Jewish Relations. By the late 1940s, her speculative bent, born of her early training as an academic, had drawn her into analysis of the conditions that had fostered Hitler's dictatorship in Germany and Joseph Stalin's in the Soviet Union. The result was The Origins of Totalitarianism, a book that established Arendt as a leading political theorist and historian. Other publications only reinforced that reputation. Following the appearance of a collection of her essays, Between Past and Present, in 1961 an admirer declared her ""one of the most brilliant . . . of living political philosophers."""
22989,"No president ever took office against a darker backdrop than Franklin Roosevelt on March 4, 1933. With banks failing by the dozens and unemployment at 28 percent, total national collapse seemed possible, and the day's gray weather only reinforced the bleak mood. The carefully chosen words of Roosevelt's inaugural speech, however, briefly lifted the gloom, and when he broke into a confident smile at the close, the crowd sent up a relieved cheer. The optimism of that moment grew in the coming months as Roosevelt's New Dealers launched their whirlwind of innovative measures to cure the Great Depression.  Caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias produced this rendering of the inauguration for Vanity Fair, which billed it as a panorama of ""magnificos, diplomats, and military commanders."" In the lower right is the doleful ""Forgotten Man,"" wearing a sandwich board-a grim reminder of the country's dire straits.  "
23016,"Often called the ""father of American conservation,"" George Bird Grinnell was instrumental in convincing others about the importance of using natural resources wisely. He lived in New York City but directed great attention to western lands and the region's Native peoples. Beginning in 1870, when he accompanied Yale paleontologist Othniel Marsh on a ""bone-hunting"" trip to the plains, Grinnell tried to devote a portion of every year to travel and study in the West. Becoming editor-in-chief of Forest and Stream in 1881, he transformed this sportsmen's weekly into the nation's leading voice for conservation. In addition to helping found several organizations devoted to this cause-including the Audubon Society, the Boone and Crockett Club, and the American Game Association-Grinnell also counseled his friend Theodore Roosevelt about the subject. One of his final achievements was leading the successful decade-long campaign to establish Glacier National Park."
23078,"At age fifteen, veteran vaudeville performer Rose Louise Hovick found herself stranded in Toledo, Ohio, without any bookings for her song and dance act. In desperation, she agreed to fill in at a local burlesque house, and so began Hovick's transformation into Gypsy Rose Lee, America's most famous practitioner in the art of disrobing. Among the secrets of Lee's magic was an ability to deny her audiences some of what they expected without making them feel cheated. As she once put it, ""You don't have to be naked to look naked. You just have to think naked."" Out of that coyness emerged an act that, according to one burlesque house owner, turned striptease into ""seven minutes of sheer art."" Pundit H. L. Mencken, feeling that ""stripper"" was an unworthy word for Lee, declared her an ""ecdysiast,"" a term he coined from two Greek words."
23193,"This 1919 portrait documents the youthful friendship of author Thornton Wilder and artist Reginald Marsh, both undergraduates at Yale. Raised in affluence, the two nonetheless sought to capture common human themes in their work. Wilder said of his writing: ""I am interested in those things that repeat and repeat in the lives of millions."" He became the only writer to win the Pulitzer Prize both for plays (Our Town, 1938, and The Skin of Our Teeth, 1943) and a novel (The Bridge of San Luis Rey, 1928). Like Wilder, Marsh represented a broad spectrum of people, from shop girls to vaudeville stars. Although he adopts a traditional format here, Marsh already reveals his distinctive draftsmanship in the undulating lines and carefully modulated shading of Wilder's facial features. The portrait's energy conveys the intense talent that would lead both men to extraordinary success.  "
23229,"This sketch was one of two that Volck made of Confederate raiders returning from Pennsylvania. This one refers to Jeb Stuart’s cavalry raid at Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in September 1862. Intent upon distracting Union general George B. McClellan from actively pursuing Robert E. Lee’s retreat back into Virginia after the Battle of Antietam, Stuart made a sweeping circle into Pennsylvania, capturing hundreds of horses and supplies before rejoining Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. This was the second time that Stuart’s cavalry had circled McClellan’s army in three months."
23274,"Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" tour swept the United States in 1985, exposing teenagers and parents to a new kind of female singer who embraced both her femininity and her sexual freedom. The article accompanying this photograph in Time magazine called her personality ""as forceful and well organized as D-Day."" Madonna began her professional career as a dancer in New York, but soon turned her talents to singing. When this issue of Time hit newsstands in May 1985, both of her albums, Madonna and Like a Virgin, had gone platinum, and her movie debut in Desperately Seeking Susan was getting good reviews. Madonna was emerging as a 1980s icon and she soon became one of the most famous women in the world.  "
23399,"American boxing great Joe Louis began his pro career in 1934 and quickly eliminated a series of opponents with his devastating knockout punch. Widely expected to take the 1936 heavyweight title, Louis was stunned by his defeat at the hands of German champion Max Schmeling. When he reentered the ring against Schmeling in 1938,  far more was at stake than a world heavyweight crown. Schmeling came to the contest as Adolf Hitler's champion of Aryan supremacy while Louis, the first African American boxer to win the enthusiastic support of black and white Americans alike, was embraced as democracy's standard-bearer. Louis struck like lightning when the fight began. Staggering Schmeling with a sequence of tremendous blows, he took only 124 seconds to claim one of the sweetest victories in boxing history. As reporter Heywood Broun rightly observed, Louis had ""exploded the Nordic myth with a boxing glove."""
23399,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."

23435,"The results of the bloodletting at Antietam were inconclusive. Robert E. Lee was forced to withdraw to the South, ending his first attempt to take the war to the North. But George B. McClellan, despite overwhelming superiority, was unable to score a knockout blow against the Army of Northern Virginia. The political consequences of Antietam were large, however. Abraham Lincoln used the victory as the occasion to announce his Emancipation Proclamation, effectively making the war for the Union also into a war against slavery. As well as radicalizing the Union’s war aims, the proclamation (which took effect on January 1, 1863), had the diplomatic result of making it impossible for European powers to recognize the Confederacy as a legitimate government. Militarily, Lincoln’s dissatisfaction with McClellan’s performance, including his nonresponsiveness during their October 1862 meeting, led to him being removed from his command in early November."
23461,"Born upstate New York    The Mohawk chief Sa Ga Yeath Qua Pieth Tow was one of five Iroquois leaders to meet with Queen Anne and her court in April 1710. Accompanied by Colonel Pieter Schuyler, the mayor of Albany, this delegation traveled to London hoping to strengthen its political and trading alliance with England. Since the outbreak of Queen Anne's War in 1701, the French had been regularly raiding poorly defended English settlements in upstate New York. Although the Iroquois tribes had provided the English with some military assistance, the pleas of English colonists for help in this struggle had fallen largely on deaf ears back in England. Sa Ga Yeath Qua Pieth Tow and his fellow delegates convinced Queen Anne to commit the resources to help defend the contested border with France, thereby hastening the war's end and formalizing an alliance that endured throughout much of the eighteenth century."
23495,"Buckle on your armor for the fight, for the ground once lost is lost forever. It was this sentiment that guided financier Collis P. Huntington, one of the so-called ""Big Four"" who oversaw the construction of the western portion of the transcontinental railroad. Having joined the California Gold Rush in 1849, Huntington had limited success operating trading posts in and around Sacramento. Eventually partnering with Mark Hopkins, Charles Crocker, and Leland Stanford, he helped to incorporate the Central Pacific Railroad in 1861. After President Abraham Lincoln signed the Pacific Railway Act the following year, the Central Pacific began to lay tracks eastward from California while the Union Pacific Railroad moved westward from midcontinent. Sensitive to this rivalry, Huntington pushed crews on the Central Pacific-including two thousand Chinese laborers-to complete as much track as possible. In 1869 the two lines met at Promontory Point, Utah, where a great celebration was held. "
23498,"Formed in the steel town of Homestead, Pennsylvania, in 1912 by former player Cumberland Posey, the Homestead Grays would become one of baseball's greatest clubs and gate attractions, operating for thirty-eight seasons.   At this time, major league baseball banned African American players; only in other leagues could they compete professionally. By 1935 the Grays were playing in the Negro National League. In 1937 hitting catcher Josh Gibson returned to the Grays from the Pittsburgh Crawfords and teamed with slugger Buck Leonard to lead them to an unprecedented nine Negro League championships.  The major league's ban on black players ended in 1947, when Jackie Robinson opened the season as starting first baseman for the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Negro National League collapsed soon thereafter. The Grays struggled as an independent club for two years, but disbanded at the close of the 1950 season.  "
23521,"Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony were two of America's most important leaders in the initial quest for women's rights in the nineteenth century. Both women had been active in other aspects of antebellum reform (including the antislavery and temperance movements) before meeting in 1851. The meeting confirmed their own views that the ""maleness"" of the nation's laws needed to be challenged and intensified their determination to build a mass movement for women's rights. Although they did not live to see the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the vote, Stanton and Anthony built the foundation for women's suffrage in the twentieth century.   "
23538,"German-born Franz Sigel was one of several political generals whose Civil War service proved to be largely ineffective and worrisome to President Lincoln. Sigel aroused the spite of Adalbert Volck for his foibles on the battlefield. And despite their shared Germanic ancestry, Volck and Sigel had different views of American patriotism. Sigel, however, did prove to be useful in recruiting German immigrants, many of whom could speak little English. ""I’m going to fight mit Sigel"" became a favorite wartime slogan and song. Volck satirizes Sigel and his ""valiant men"" as they harass and draw their weapons on women and children whom they have just made destitute by burning their homes."
23560,"Born New York City   Author of the North’s unofficial Civil War anthem, “The Battle Hymn of the Republic,” Julia Ward Howe balanced multiple identities as a mother, poet, playwright, peace advocate, and tireless promoter of women’s rights. While raising six children, she sought ways to participate in public life, eventually becoming a leader of the suffrage movement. Although her husband, Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, head of Boston’s Perkins Institute for the Blind and an active leader in abolitionism, did not support his wife’s public activism, she made her voice heard through publishing. In 1870, she founded Woman’s Journal, a suffragist weekly magazine. Subsequently, she founded and served as president of the Association for the Advancement of Women. New York portrait photographer Alice Boughton met Howe in Boston at the end of Howe’s life for a brief portrait session. Boughton captures Howe’s keen intellect, a quality that defined her as she laid the groundwork for the feminist movement."
23567,"John Wesley Powell's work as an explorer, a geologist, and an anthropologist in the American West helped to shape national policies regarding the development of public lands and the welfare of Native American tribes. Celebrated in 1869 for leading the first American expedition through the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River, Powell's greater contribution came in the form of scientific reports-many of which went against long-held beliefs-on western lands and the peoples living there. Powell's advocacy of communal or government control of water for irrigation in the West was derided at the time, yet his studies served as the foundation for twentieth-century water-use policies. As director of both the U.S. Geological Survey and the Bureau of Ethnology, he saw science as a vital force in promoting the common good. These photographs show Powell and two different Paiute men during his 1873 expedition into the Southwest.  "
23602,"Albert Berghaus was a sketch artist for Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper when he made this pencil drawing of the moment on December 2, 1859, when John Brown was brought out of the jail in Charles Town, Virginia, to be conveyed in a furniture wagon to the place of execution. This sketch appeared as a wood-block engraving in Leslie's newspaper on December 17."
23611,"Marshall W. ""Major"" Taylor, the son of a coachman from Indianapolis, was the ""fastest bicycle rider the world had ever known"" when this poster was published in 1902. In the course of his sixteen-year career, Taylor competed in races throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand; won numerous championships; set several world records; and became one of the most glorified cyclists of the era when bicycling was an international craze. This Belgian poster, which advertises Taylor's appearance at a small fair at the Velodrome Zurenborg in Antwerp, avoids the decorative conceits of the renowned poster artists. Nonetheless, with its emphatic double image, brilliant yellow background, and red, white, and blue accents, it is a visually compelling announcement of the appearance of an athlete who, despite overt discrimination, ""gained all the triumphs, gold, and glory possible to obtain"" in this sport. "
23644,"Born Lawnton, Pennsylvania    After working as an engineer in various capacities and places, Alexander Calder began painting New York City street scenes and portraits. These reflect the realist approach of his teachers at the Art Students League, notably John Sloan. In this work Calder pictures himself as a handsome young man still sporting the mustache he said he “raised . . . to look more like a seasoned engineer.”  Calder created this self-portrait at the moment when his career was beginning to take off with the wire sculptures he made. In it we see a contemplative view of a young man in the process of establishing his reputation as a professional artist. "
23723,"The South responded with fury to Abraham Lincoln’s election, and seven states, beginning with South Carolina, seceded from the Union during the winter of 1860–61. Tensions were high, and armed conflict seemed imminent. It was in this atmosphere that Lincoln made his way from Springfield, Illinois, to Washington for the inauguration in March. When the president-elect reached Baltimore, credible rumors surfaced of a possible assassination attempt. So under advice from detective Alan Pinkerton, Lincoln was hurried on to Washington, arriving early in the morning, with no fanfare. This surreptitious entry caused much mirth among southerners, who sniggered at Lincoln’s cowardice. Adalbert Volck’s etching mocks the president’s timidity, showing Lincoln, still wearing a nightshirt and cap, pulling into Washington in the boxcar in which he had been hidden, an apparition that scares the railyard cat."
23724,"Perhaps Volck’s most heart-wrenching sketch, Tracks of the Armies portrayed Confederate veterans who returned to their families, only to find their loved ones missing or dead, and their homes in ruins."
23754,"In 1857, the inventor of a coal-burning stove, Jordan Mott, commissioned Christian Schussele to paint a group portrait of eighteen American scientists and inventors who ""had altered the course of contemporary civilization."" As with Schussele's celebration of American letters, Washington Irving . . . at Sunnyside, the group portrait did not mark an actual occasion but was designed to honor the achievements of American industry. The artist sketched study portraits of each of his subjects before putting them all into his final, formal composition. Men of Progress is a remarkable document of the growth of the American economy by the 1850s as it celebrates the inventions and processes of manufacturing pioneered by men such as Cyrus McCormick, Charles Goodyear, Samuel Colt, Samuel Morse, Elias Howe, and fourteen others."
23773,"Walter White headed the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) from 1931 to 1955. During these difficult years, he directed an unsuccessful struggle for an anti-lynching bill and implemented a highly successful long-range campaign of legal actions, culminating in the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing discrimination in the nation's schools. White's tenure at the NAACP saw it through the Great Depression, when membership and donations declined precipitously and it faced a strong challenge from the Communist Party-USA, which actively competed for African American members. After World War II and during the beginnings of the Cold War, White remained a staunch anti-Communist and stressed the need for racial justice in America, to compete with the Soviets in winning Third World allies. Due in part to White's urging, Harry Truman ran on a civil rights platform in the 1948 presidential election."
23773,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
23824,"Born Chireno, Texas  Tap wizard Ann Miller first earned a reputation by tapping at the machine-gun rate of 500 taps per minute. A popular screen personality beginning with Stage Door (1937), she became a major star when MGM cast her in such important postwar movie musicals as Easter Parade, On the Town, and Kiss Me Kate.  In the 1950s, Miller was a familiar presence to television audiences through her appearances on variety shows like The Ed Sullivan Show; she also had a notable stage career, highlighted by the hit Broadway musical revue Sugar Babies, which co-starred Mickey Rooney. She won over a whole new generation of fans with MGM’s 1976 release of That’s Entertainment, Part II, which featured clips of some of her best dance sequences.   When asked about her long and spectacular career, Miller said, “I had a ball!”"
23985,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Congress’ failure to recharter the Bank of the United States and the soaring inflation following the War of 1812 led merchants and many in government to call for a new national bank. The Second National Bank was chartered in 1816. In 1822 Nicholas Biddle was selected to be the bank’s president, which made him one of the most powerful men in the nation. He was able to guide the economy through a spectacular period of growth, but President Andrew Jackson viewed him as bending the acts of government for the “rich and powerful.” Jackson vetoed the bank’s charter in 1832. "
24073,"When Jacob Epstein completed this sculpture in 1928, Paul Robeson was enjoying huge success in London, both in the English production of Show Boat and in a series of triumphant concerts. Lionized by English society, he was experiencing an acceptance hardly imaginable by blacks in America: ""Everyone wanted to know Paul and to be seen with him,"" said a fellow cast member, ""especially some of our so-called society ladies."" His wife wrote to a friend that they both were feeling ""as though at last we are at the end of a long journey. Paul . . . is tickled to death and greatly relieved."""
24164,"Born Tuscumbia, Alabama  Struck by an illness that left her both blind and deaf at nineteen months, Helen Keller spent her early years locked in a solitary universe that those around her were incapable of penetrating. In early 1887, when a new teacher named Anne Sullivan came into her life, Keller learned to communicate via tactile sign language and began to connect to those around her. That summer she was writing her first letter. Keller’s quick progress did not stop there. By 1904, she had graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College, written a best-selling autobiography, and become an admired symbol of the human spirit’s power to overcome adversity. In 1924 she became the official spokesperson for the newly formed American Foundation for the Blind and, thanks to her successful lobbying, gained inclusion of a clause in the Social Security Act of 1935 that made the blind eligible for grant assistance."
24170,"In 1930 the Gershwin musical Girl Crazy opened on Broadway, and toward the end of the first act, an unknown singer named Ethel Merman mesmerized the audience with her rendition of ""I Got Rhythm,"" in the course of which she held a high-C for sixteen bars. As Merman later put it, by the time the applause died, ""a star had been born. Me."" Over the next five decades, her booming voice and brassy style were the main attraction of some of the most successful Broadway musicals ever, including Anything Goes, Gypsy, and Annie Get Your Gun-whose score included her trademark song, ""There's No Business Like Show Business."" Of her singing technique, Merman once said, ""I just stand up and holler and hope that my voice holds out."""
24198,"Described by poet Maya Angelou as the ""queen of the arts,"" Elizabeth Catlett has created, over the course of the last seventy years, paintings, prints, and sculptures that touch upon many important social and political issues. Refused admission to an all-white art school, Catlett studied at Howard University and then with painter Grant Wood at the University of Iowa. Her work for the Public Works Art Project during the 1930s introduced her to Diego Rivera and other socially conscious mural painters. This group influenced the direction of her art; it also introduced her to artistic traditions in Mexico, where she permanently relocated in 1946. She has completed numerous commissions in the United States and Mexico, and to this day she remains committed to the idea that ""art is important only to the extent that it helps in the liberation of our people."""
24281,"Destined to become one of the screen's most glamorous and enduring stars, Joan Crawford was dancing in the chorus of a Broadway revue when an MGM talent scout discovered her in 1924. She began her movie career with appearances in a number of minor silent films before soaring to stardom in 1928 with her tabletop performance of an exuberant Charleston in Our Dancing Daughters. Crawford successfully navigated the changeover to talking pictures and starred throughout the 1930s with many of Hollywood's top leading men, including Fred Astaire and Clark Gable. Initially cast as a glamour girl by MGM, she moved to Warner Brothers in 1943, where she fought successfully for more serious and challenging parts. Crawford soon gained respect as an accomplished actress and was honored with the Academy Award in 1945 for her portrayal of the title character in the popular melodrama Mildred Pierce.  "
24372,"Born San Gabriel, California  One of the ablest American field commanders in World War II, General George S. Patton was both a superb military tactician and a master of tank warfare. Instrumental in dislodging the Germans from North Africa, Patton led the U.S. Seventh Army in a joint operation with the British Eighth Army in 1943 that resulted in the successful invasion of Sicily and the subsequent capture of the Italian cities of Palermo and Messina. As commander of the U.S. Third Army in the campaign that followed the Allied invasion of France in June 1944, he rapidly achieved his objectives through the coordinated use of tanks, motorized infantry, artillery, and air support. After German forces launched the December 1944 counteroffensive that became the Battle of the Bulge, Patton raced his Third Army troops into position, where they helped turn the tide of that battle and in doing so, hastened the end of the war."
24426,"Driven by an intense determination to win, jockey Bill Hartack was one of horse racing's fiercest competitors for more than two decades. Making his riding debut in 1952 at the age of nineteen, he wasted no time in compiling a record for veterans to envy. Hartack was the winningest jockey on the circuit for three consecutive years (1955-57), and in 1957 he became the first to top the three-million-dollar mark for purses won in a single season. That same year, he claimed his first Kentucky Derby victory, a feat he would repeat four times over the next eleven years, earning praise as one of the greatest derby winners of all time. Never satisfied with anything less than a trip to the winner's circle, Hartack pushed himself and his mounts relentlessly. ""I only know one way to ride,"" he declared, ""and that's all out.""  "
24440,"  Author and impresario Lincoln Kirstein, a lifelong friend of the Russian-born painter and set designer Pavel Tchelitchew, helped promote the artist's career after his emigration to the United States in 1934. When Kirstein and choreographer George Balanchine produced Christoph Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice at the Metropolitan Opera in 1936, they commissioned Tchelitchew to design the sets and costumes. The artist painted Kirstein's portrait the following year, for which he made several drawings. The painting, a triple portrait depicting Kirstein in various guises, reveals Tchelitchew's fascination with multiple perspectives and interior essences. This penetrating drawing is a more straightforward portrayal of the young man about whom the composer Igor Stravinsky would write, ""Kirstein was a young giant then, who wore a fierce expression and who matched it with a bellicose dedication to the beautiful and a contempt for the sham."""
24453,"George Washington's presidency coincided with the advent of a real printmaking industry in the United States. With the demand booming for both illustration and popular prints for framing, engravers could now enjoy a steady market. Washington's growing status as a national icon after the Revolutionary War spurred the fledgling industry to supply the demand for inexpensive portraits. Various engravings show Washington as a military commander, a noble citizen-who, like the Roman Cincinnatus, gave up his power to return to his farm-a statesman, and a heroic symbol of his country. Readily accessible pictures-printed portraits, cartoons, broadsides, photographs, posters, and eventually film-have played a role in presidential politics ever since.     Script #AP010, AP011, and AP012 (two labels)    [#2: Object label with curatorial for all three prints]  Interpreting the death of Washington    Americans responded to George Washington's death on December 14, 1799, with an outpouring of oratorical and pictorial tributes that encompassed various approaches to death, grief, and glorification. Enoch Gridley's engraving includes the traditional elements of fashionable neoclassical mourning art: portrait, urn, obelisk, and weeping figure of Columbia. Additional allegorical figures further exalt the ""father of his country,"" personifying, according to a published broadside, Fame, Wisdom, Liberty, and Truth. David Edwin's Apotheosis engraving implies a religious transformation as Washington ascends from his earthly home to be welcomed by heroes on high. The more secular deathbed scene, depicting Washington's physicians taking his pulse with the aid of a stopwatch, related to published accounts of his stoic final moments. Americans could buy the same image, along with a companion mourning picture, in the form of a printed handkerchief.  "
24484,"The charismatic photographer Alfred Stieglitz dominated developments in American photography and art in the first fifteen years of the twentieth century. A superb craftsman himself, Stieglitz led the fight to win recognition for photography as a fine art rather than a commercial medium. In 1902 he established the Photo Secession, an association for art photographers, and opened a gallery at 291 Fifth Avenue in New York City. He also launched the journal Camera Work, where this photogravure by a promising young Photo Secession associate, Alvin Langdon Coburn, appeared in 1908. Stieglitz's 291 Gallery, a showcase for pictorialist photography as well as the most innovative European and American art, became the spiritual center of the avant-garde before World War I. At 291 and his later gallery, the Intimate Gallery, Stieglitz encouraged innovation among American artists and photographers.  "
24543,"Be ashamed to die until you have won some victory of humanity, Horace Mann told the graduating class at Antioch College, just months before his own death. Mann's greatest victories had been achieved during his years as secretary of the Massachusetts Board of Education (1837-48), when he revolutionized a faltering school system by improving the curriculum, persuading the legislature to appropriate more money for salaries and buildings, and establishing the country's first teacher-training institutions. Free public education, Mann proclaimed, was essential, at a time of increased immigration and expanding democracy, to the good order and prosperity of society."
24550,"  George Bush was described by James Baker, then Ronald Reagan's chief of staff, as a ""model vice president,"" dedicated and loyal to the president. Bush had strenuously competed with Reagan for the Republican presidential nomination and then accepted second place on the ticket. ""The president must know,"" Bush asserted, ""that he can have the vice president for him and he must not think he has to look over his shoulder."" From a very different background than Reagan, Bush used his considerable social skills to adjust to the president's personality, and rarely expressed differing views in public. He worked at making his weekly lunches with the president a relaxed occasion, with casual conversation. ""It was a respite,"" Bush recalled, and ""I think he looked forward to them."" Reagan appreciated Bush's loyalty and made him head of his crisis management team. This task was usually given to the secretary of state, but the president was more comfortable with Bush doing it."
24552,"Charles McKim was one of the most respected architects of his time, and he played a major role in making his firm, McKim, Mead, and White, a dominant force in shaping American architecture-primarily in the classical style-at the turn of the twentieth century. Among McKim's greatest triumphs were the Boston Public Library and New York City's Pennsylvania Station. In 1878, McKim toured France, where he met up with the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens. Saint-Gaudens made this relief portrait of McKim as a ""souvenir of the ten jolly days"" they had just shared.  "
24631,"A trumpet virtuoso with a wide smile and an ebullient personality, jazz pioneer Louis Armstrong helped to transform this musical tradition into an international phenomenon, during the process becoming one of America's most beloved twentieth-century entertainers. Raised in New Orleans, Armstrong moved to Chicago in 1922 to join Joe Oliver's Creole Jazz Band. Several years later, he formed his own band, billed himself as the ""World's Greatest Trumpet Player,"" and helped to develop the jazz style popularly known as swing. As his contemporary Duke Ellington observed, ""Satchmo"" became, over his long career, the ""epitome of jazz,"" playing before capacity audiences throughout America and abroad. Well-regarded as a leader in the campaign for racial equality, Armstrong was first and foremost the consummate performer. As he explained, ""I never tried to prove nothing, just always wanted to give a good show."""
24701,"Born Ulster County, New York  In 1843 ex-slave Isabella Baumfree obeyed God’s personal commandment to her, changed her name to Sojourner Truth, and became an itinerant preacher. She quickly developed into a major attraction on the revival circuit for the power and ingenuity of her prophetic speeches. Her life history drew her into abolitionism, and she entranced antislavery audiences with her personal testimony. Like Frederick Douglass, Truth was a charismatic figure because she was not a victim but a leader and a powerful example of African American womanhood. As she concluded a compelling oration on women’s rights, ""I could work as much . . . and bear the lash as well [as a man]—and ain’t I a woman?""  To finance her speaking tours, she sold copies of her ghostwritten autobiography and photographs of herself, such as the one seen here."
24727,"Lieutenant William Calley was charged on September 5, 1969, with six counts of premeditated murder in leading his command, Charlie Company of the Americal Division, in the massacre of civilians living in the Vietnamese hamlet of My Lai. Although Calley was convicted, his case became a cause célèbre and his guilt was disputed as Americans argued whether his action was criminally atypical or part of the military's tolerance of terror against Vietnamese civilians. The opaque mask that William Calley seems to wear in this Time magazine cover represents how murky and divisive were the moral and legal issues spawned by the Vietnam War. This question of ultimate responsibility for how the war was fought is still fiercely debated by an American public which has yet to find the clear-cut answer that it seeks. Calley, sentenced to life in prison, served three and one-half years of house arrest.  "
24819,"Common soldiers marched; officers rode. If the officers became famous enough, so did their horses. Grant had Cincinnati and Jeff Davis, but neither became as renowned as Traveller, Lee’s mount throughout the war. Traveller’s name was originally Greenbrier—Lee had purchased him while on duty in the Carolinas in 1861—but the horse’s stamina (he was “a fine traveller”) led to a new sobriquet. Curiously, Grant and Lee, each a fine horseman, both suffered serious injuries from their mounts. Traveller knocked Lee over during the Antietam campaign, spraining his wrists, and Grant had a horse fall on him before Shiloh. Traveller stayed with his master after the war, when Lee was a familiar sight riding around Lexington, Virginia. At Lee’s funeral in October 1870, Traveller walked, riderless, behind the caisson carrying the coffin. Traveller had to be put down a year later after contracting tetanus.   Robert E. Lee     Los soldados comunes marchaban, los oficiales cabalgaban. Si los oficiales se volvían lo suficientemente conocidos, sus caballos también. Grant tenía a Cincinnati y Jeff Davis, pero ninguno se volvió tan conocido como Traveller, el caballo de Lee durante toda la guerra. Lee compró el caballo llamado Greenbrier mientras trabajaba en las Carolinas en 1861, pero la resistencia del caballo (era un ""verdadero viajero"") le dio un nuevo sobrenombre. Curiosamente, Grant y Lee, ambos buenos jinetes, sufrieron heridas serías durante sus cabalgatas. Traveller tiró a Lee durante la campaña de Antietam, lo que le esguinzó las muñecas, y a Grant se le cayó un caballo encima durante Shiloh. Traveller se quedó con su dueño después de la guerra y se volvió común ver a Lee cabalgar por Lexington, Virginia. En el entierro de Lee, en octubre de 1870, Traveller caminaba, sin jinete, detrás del coche que llevaba el ataúd. Hubo que sacrificar un año después a Traveller, ya que se contagió de tétanos.

24820,"Born Alameda, California  On April 18, 1942, less than five months after Japan’s surprise attack on Pearl Harbor propelled the United States into World War II, ace pilot Jimmy Doolittle carried out the first American aerial assault against the Japanese mainland. Operating in broad daylight, Doolittle boldly led sixteen B-25 bombers on a high-risk mission targeting the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, Kobe, Nagoya, and Osaka. Although the damage to Japanese installations was modest, the audacity of Doolittle’s raid cheered his countrymen and shocked Japan’s military strategists, who believed the U.S. incapable of mounting such an attack after its losses at Pearl Harbor. Hailed as the first American hero of the war, Doolittle was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor and promoted by President Roosevelt to the rank of brigadier general. He later provided critical leadership as an Army Air Force commander in air campaigns in North Africa and Europe."
24825,"At the turn of the twentieth century, Ezra Pound demanded that American poets ""make it [poetry] new."" If Walt Whitman laid the groundwork for modern poetry, Pound ushered it into the new century with an insistence that form should be as modern as poetry’s subjects. Pound was antipathetic to Whitman, possibly because they were both too alike in their mission to break existing literary molds and create a new poetics. Pound was also a generous and keen-eyed supporter of rising talent; among his protégés were Robert Frost and T. S. Eliot.  Pound’s verse was fast, glancing, and imagistic. He wrote the shortest great poem ever, ""In a Station of the Metro,"" which reads: ""The apparition of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough."" His great work was the impossibly sprawling Cantos, which he began in 1917 and finished in 1969, with a total of 109 works. It is a modern epic that begins with allusions to the Odyssey (""And then went down to the ship / Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea""), surveys world and American history, sets out Pound’s ill-considered (and anti-Semitic) economic schemes, and ends in confusion and incoherence, mirroring Pound’s own personal fate."
24864,"The 1960s was a decade of exploring new frontiers and pushing the boundaries in seemingly all facets of life. According to Time, sex had suddenly become “a spectator sport,” based on what Americans were seeing, hearing, and reading. In the realms of literature, motion pictures, and theater, “the U.S. is now by far the freest country in the Western world.” All of this only amplified the classic dilemma of pornography versus “outspoken art.” Reporting on the “sex explosion” presented challenges for Time’s more conventional editors. This cover, for instance, “was the result of a lot of hard thinking, and various attempts to solve the problem of depicting sex in its new freedom but with restraint.” Artist Dennis Wheeler solved it with his clever design of a zippered fig leaf partially covering the naked bodies of two actors from the off-Broadway hit Oh! Calcutta!  La explosión sexual     Los sesenta fueron años de explorar nuevas fronteras y rebasar límites al parecer en todos los aspectos de la vida. Según Time, el sexo de pronto se convirtió en un espectáculo o “deporte para espectadores” a juzgar por lo que miraban, escuchaban o leían los estadounidenses. En los ámbitos de la literatura, el cine y el teatro, “Estados Unidos es ahora por mucho el país más liberado del mundo occidental”. Todo esto no hacía más que amplificar el clásico dilema de pornografía versus “arte franco”. Cubrir eventos de esta “explosión sexual” presentaba retos para los editores más convencionales de Time. Por ejemplo, esta portada “fue el resultado de serias reflexiones y varios intentos de abordar el problema de representar el sexo en su nuevo espíritu de libertad pero con moderación”. El artista Dennis Wheeler lo resolvió con un ingenioso diseño: una hoja de parra con zíper que cubría los cuerpos desnudos de dos actores de la exitosa obra vanguardista Oh! Calcutta!

24881,"Trained as a lawyer, Washington Irving found the law tedious and drifted into writing, publishing the first of his comic tales, A History of New York, in 1809. He went on to become a popular and critical success in both America and England with such tales as ""Rip Van Winkle"" and ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."" Irving modeled his writing on a romanticized view of history as embodied in the novels of Sir Walter Scott. His originality came from basing that style in distinctly American material, especially his wry delineation of well-known American ""types.""  "
24896,"The political prominence of Illinois senator Stephen A. Douglas rested largely on ""popular sovereignty""-a formula he had devised in the early 1850s to quell the controversy over slavery's westward extension by permitting the settlers of new territories to decide through balloting whether or not to allow slaveholding. In his quest for the presidency in 1860, he continued to urge this principle. By then, however, it satisfied neither North nor South. Although he was Lincoln's nearest rival in the four-way contest that year, his defeat in November was almost inevitable.   This portrait served as a visual backdrop at campaign rallies on Douglas's behalf."

24956,"Born Richmond, Virginia  In the 1920s Bill “Bojangles” Robinson was a vaudeville headliner billed as “The World’s Greatest Tap Dancer.” But today he is remembered most for teaching Shirley Temple how to tap in The Little Colonel, The Littlest Rebel, Just Around the Corner, and Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. The “stair dance” from The Little Colonel was perhaps their most famous dance together, with Robinson dancing the steps for Temple first so she could imitate him.  His style of tap was “up on its toes”—dancing crossover steps on the balls of his feet—rather than the earlier flat-footed shuffling style. He said that his style influenced such important dancers in his day as the Nicholas Brothers, Fred Astaire, and Eleanor Powell.  One biographer said, “Robinson became a modern John Henry, who instead of driving steel, laid down iron taps.”"
24958,"Born Liberty, Indiana  After the fall of Fort Sumter in April 1861, Ambrose Burnside organized and led the First Rhode Island Regiment of Volunteers. Among the first units to come to the defense of Washington, D.C., that summer, Burnside and his men were in the thick of the fighting at the First Battle of Bull Run. In November 1862, Burnside reluctantly succeeded George McClellan as head of the Army of the Potomac but was relieved of that command following the Union army’s crushing defeat at Fredericksburg in December. He posed for this portrait wearing the distinctive tunic he designed for members of Rhode Island’s militia."
24959,"Born San Diego, California  The powerful crack of Ted Williams’s bat was a familiar sound to Red Sox fans throughout the legendary outfielder’s nineteen seasons with the Boston ball club. Williams showed great promise from the start. In 1939—his debut year in the major leagues—he recorded a .327 batting average and took home Rookie of the Year honors. Two seasons later, his average soared to a phenomenal .406—a feat that has not been equaled since. The Red Sox slugger was at the peak of his powers when he missed nearly five seasons of play while serving in World War II and in Korea. Despite these lengthy interruptions to his career, Williams still managed to achieve the enviable lifetime batting average of .344, along with a slugging percentage of .634. Chosen for eighteen American League All-Star teams, Williams finished his career with 521 home runs and 2,654 hits."
25118,"Born Irkutsk, Russia  One of the most electrifying dancers of the twentieth century, Rudolf Nureyev made international headlines when he defected from the Kirov Ballet in Paris in 1961. He then began a celebrated collaboration with Royal Ballet prima ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn. Restlessly creative, he also extended his career into popular culture, appearing in movies (Les Sylphides and Valentino) and on television, including a memorable appearance with Miss Piggy on The Muppet Show.  Nureyev vastly expanded the role of the male dancer. His impact on the popularity of dance was even more important, and at the height of his star power in 1975 Time magazine wrote “The one person most responsible for the dance explosion in America is Nureyev.”   When Nureyev leapt, his high, arching jumps made audiences gasp: “I fly,” he explained. “I am Nureyev, dancer. I am on sale. If you like, you buy.” America bought, and dance flourished."
25127,"Since the late nineteenth century, the editorial cartoon has played a provocative role in presidential politics, countering partisan advertising with irreverence. Australian-born Pulitzer-Prize winner Pat Oliphant (born 1935) hones a distinctive, repeatable caricature of each incoming president. When each fails to live up to expectations, those exaggerated figures begin to age, sag, shrink, weaken, or bloat. Oliphant has summarized his cartoon depictions of each president since Lyndon Johnson in a series of bronze sculptures. His images of Richard Nixon as a haunting and malevolent Napoleon, Gerald Ford as Band-Aided hollow mask, Jimmy Carter as an insignificant miniature, and George H. W. Bush as a wizened horseshoe player, remind us of the powerful impact of satiric portraiture.  "
25133,"Born New York City    Jonas Salk built his career on developing vaccines against influenza and polio. In the 1940s he helped revolutionize immunology by developing vaccines that did not expose recipients to the disease itself. In 1947, as America confronted a polio epidemic, Salk turned to finding a vaccine for the disease, reporting successful results by 1953; by 1955 the Salk vaccine was in widespread use and dramatically diminished the impact of polio, especially among children. Salk never claimed a patent for the vaccine, asking ""Could you patent the sun?"""
25140,"The assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy in the spring of 1968 unleashed a heated debate over America’s passion for personal firearms and the ease with which anyone could procure a rifle or pistol. By late June, Time was reporting on this debate in its cover story, which focused on, among other things, the mounting cry for new curbs on citizens’ right to bear firearms. The story got people’s attention, based on the volume of mail the magazine received.   Pop artist Roy Lichtenstein also created a vivid, riveting cover for the issue. He had long recognized the gun as an important element in American culture, and his image for Time was simply a variant of the pistol-gripping hand that he had produced on a felt banner several years earlier.     La pistola en Estados Unidos     Los asesinatos de Martin Luther King Jr. y Robert F. Kennedy en la primavera de 1968 desataron un candente debate en torno a la pasión de los norteamericanos por las armas de fuego para uso personal y lo fácil que resultaba para cualquiera obtener un rifle o una pistola. A fines de junio, Time cubrió esta controversia como tema de portada, analizando entre otros puntos en el creciente reclamo de nuevos frenos al derecho de los ciudadanos a portar armas. El reportaje acaparó la atención de los lectores, a juzgar por el volumen de cartas que recibió la revista.               La vívida portada que creó el artista pop Roy Lichtenstein para esta edición también causó impacto.

25161,"In 1983, as tensions mounted between the two superpowers, disarmament talks halted, and the arms race intensified. In January 1984, Time bestowed its “Man of the Year” award on the two men it held accountable for this escalation, President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Yuri Andropov. Reagan blamed the Soviets, “the focus of evil in the modern world.” Their recent placement of powerful missiles in Europe and the downing of a civilian South Korean plane confirmed for him that Soviet leaders viewed détente as “a one-way street . . . to pursue its own aims . . . to commit any crime, to lie, to cheat.” Reagan believed not in coexistence but in winning the Cold War. He told a Notre Dame graduating class, “The West won’t contain Communism, it will transcend Communism . . . dismiss it as some bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages are even now being written.” "
25196,"Miguel Covarrubias’s 1938 caricature, Radio Talent, depicted a cloud of popular celebrities who came to fame during the heyday of American radio broadcasting. At the depths of the Depression, radio’s two major networks—NBC and CBS—provided a cultural glue that helped bind the country together in the worst of economic times. Because everyone listened to the same thing, the vast listening audience shared a mainstream culture that was broadcast daily. Programs radiating both high and low forms of entertainment wafted through the airwaves and reached not only big cities but also small towns everywhere. Here, Covarrubias captured the most famous stars ""on the air,"" including Jack Benny, Rudy Vallee, W. C. Fields, Burns and Allen, Kate Smith, Benny Goodman, Arturo Toscanini, and Bing Crosby."
25212,"Architect Frank Lloyd Wright was past sixty when this portrait was taken in the early 1930s, and in the face of dwindling commissions, it seemed possible that his fame would rest mostly on the broadly eaved ""prairie style"" architecture he had originated several decades earlier. In fact, Wright was only getting his second wind. Over the next several years, he completed two of his most acclaimed commissions-Fallingwater, a woodland retreat cantilevered over a Pennsylvania stream, and the Johnson Wax offices in Racine, Wisconsin. In the wake of those successes came many others. Included among his later works were his ""Usonian"" experiments in creating modest-priced housing without sacrificing aesthetic excellence, and the inverted spiral structure housing New York's Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. By the time ground was broken for the Guggenheim in the early 1950s, Wright was American architecture's universally acknowledged giant."
25253,"Zachary Taylor-who rose to national prominence for his leadership in the Mexican War-is seated in this daguerreotype portrait next to his army chief of staff, William Bliss. A career military officer, Taylor served more than three decades on the western frontier, where he earned the nickname ""Old Rough and Ready"" for his unpolished demeanor and courage under fire. In 1846 Taylor was ordered to the Rio Grande, the southern boundary claimed controversially by Texas. This action upset Mexican authorities, who ordered a large force to drive out Taylor's army. Taylor distinguished himself in a series of battles that followed-most famously at Palo Alto, Monterrey, and Buena Vista. After the war, he reluctantly agreed to run for president and went on to win the 1848 campaign. Intent on unifying the nation, Taylor instead contributed to sectional tensions by adamantly refusing to extend slavery into the territories. He died unexpectedly in 1850 after only sixteen months in office."
25351,"The career of Ira Aldridge illustrates the costs that racism inflicted on African Americans and on America itself. Aldridge was one of the great actors of his age-but he was black. Unable to work in America, he moved to England in the 1820s and lived abroad until his death. Aldridge's most famous role was Othello, in which he is shown here, a part that he invested with the poignancy of his own experience; a Russian critic wrote in 1858 that ""he was Othello himself, as created by Shakespeare."" Yet Aldridge was not bound by color in his acting. He played most of Shakespeare's main characters, especially the tragic heroes. Aldridge's career foreshadows the fate of many African American artists, such as dancer Josephine Baker or jazz musician Dexter Gordon, who chose to go to Europe to find wide acclaim.   "
25355,"The Vietnam War was a Pandora’s box for President Lyndon Johnson right from the start: expanding the war might get the United States into a fight “with 700 million Chinese,” and retreating would be “strategically unwise and morally unthinkable.” But in early 1965, North Vietnam launched several surprise attacks across the border, which forced Johnson to retaliate into the neutral demilitarized zone separating North and South Vietnam, thereby escalating both the war and America’s involvement. The president’s escalation policy was welcome news to army general William C. Westmoreland, commander of 23,500 American troops and the top military advisor to the South Vietnamese army. No longer would he be ordered to fight just a defensive war; he could now strike out at the enemy offensively as well. Escalation was initially effective, and Westmoreland was later named Time’s Man of the Year for 1965.   General William C. Westmoreland  1914–2005     La guerra de Vietnam fue una caja de Pandora para el presidente Lyndon Johnson desde el principio: si la guerra se intensificaba, Estados Unidos podría verse enfrentado “con 700 millones de chinos”, pero retirarse sería “insensato en términos de estrategia e impensable en términos morales”. Sin embargo, a principios de 1965 Vietnam del Norte lanzó una serie de ataques sorpresivos al otro lado de la frontera y Johnson se vio obligado a contestar y entrar a la zona desmilitarizada que separaba Vietnam del Norte y del Sur, lo cual intensificó la guerra y la participación estadounidense. La política de recrudecimiento bélico fue bien recibida por el general William C. Westmoreland, comandante de 23,500 soldados norteamericanos y principal asesor militar del ejército de Vietnam del Sur. Ya no tendría que luchar una mera guerra defensiva, sino que podría montar la ofensiva contra su enemigo. Esta política resultó efectiva inicialmente y Westmoreland fue designado Hombre del Año 1965 por Time.

25356,"In 1821, John Summerfield, a young Methodist evangelist, arrived in New York from England to preach a gospel of salvation. A religious revival was stirring in the United States, and Summerfield found a receptive audience. In Washington the crowds that came to hear him were so great that he was forced to move outside and preach on the steps of the Capitol. ""When he becomes animated,"" a newspaper account reported, ""he appears as if the very breathings of the Spirit were on him and his countenance is lighted with a fire bright and holy.""   Summerfield was painted by his fellow Methodist William Jewett before ""disease marred his youthful beauty."" He died of tuberculosis at the age of twenty-seven, a month after he helped found the American Tract Society, established to carry the gospel across the expanding country.  "
25425,"Edward Rickenbacher and Amelia Earhart were pioneers in the early history of American aviation. Rickenbacker became a national hero during World War I as a member of the first American aerosquadron to enter combat on the western front. During that conflict he shot down more German airplanes and balloons than any other America pilot, an achievement that led to a career in the burgeoning aviation and automobile industries. Earhart achieved similar fame as a pilot. The first women to fly solo across the Atlantic, Earhart tirelessly promoted opportunities for women in aviation before losing her life in 1937 during an attempt to circumnavigate the globe.  This photograph was taken at the 1935 Indianapolis 500 auto race. As the owner of the Indianapolis Speedway and an official at the American Automobile Association, Rickenbacker had invited Earhart to serve as the referee at this Memorial Day classic."
25523,"It was one of General Ulysses S. Grant's small good fortunes after the Civil War, as he began settling into the White House as the eighteenth president, to count one of the nation's leading political cartoonists, Thomas Nast, as a friend. In part, Grant attributed his election to the presidency in 1868 ""to the pencil of Nast""; the cartoonist  was a staunch supporter of both Grant and the Republican Party. NastHe developed a camaraderie with the president and the first family, as this watercolor drawing of Grant might suggest. On the other hand, Nast had unleashed all of his satiric talents in criticizing the former administration of President Andrew Johnson for being too lenient toward the unreconstructed former Confederate states. Yet Nast's drawing of Grant has, in hindsight, become a caricature of his ""armchair"" presidency, one in which he relegated too much authority to untrustworthy subordinates, an interpretation that the artist never intended to suggest.  "
25554,"Vladimir Horowitz's triumphant return to his native Russia in 1986 took place after nearly sixty years of international success as a pianist. American citizen Horowitz, his wife Wanda, and his $40,000 Steinway piano arrived in Moscow to adoring fans and rioting Russian crowds, all hoping to experience the passion aroused by Horowitz's powerful playing. Time magazine chose this event, a parting of the Iron Curtain in the name of music, for its cover story on May 5, 1986. R. B. Kitaj illustrated Horowitz at his piano. Kitaj had begun working in pastels after admiring an Edgar Degas exhibition in 1974. He felt the medium would help him capture not just the likeness of the sitter but also the personality. The rough surface of Kitaj's pastel, unlike Degas's smoother approach, adds a muscular vitality to his image.  "
25570,"James Butler Hickok received his nickname ""Wild Bill"" after he shot and killed a man-supposedly in self-defense-during an argument over money in 1861. Seated at the right in this tintype portrait, Hickok served as a scout during the Civil War and later worked in law enforcement in Kansas. Although he accepted William F. Cody's invitation in 1873 to perform together in the play Scouts of the Plains, he found the stage was not to his liking and returned to his preferred full-time work as a professional gambler. Back in the West, he earned a wide reputation for his skill as a card player and for his adeptness as a gunfighter. While dime novelists exaggerated many of his feats, he was nonetheless a deadly fighting man. This photograph was taken around 1876, the year Hickok was shot and killed while playing poker in a saloon in Deadwood, Dakota Territory."
25632,"Born Santa Monica, California  In 1932, when she was three, Shirley Temple appeared in a series of movie shorts called Baby Burlesks. Two years later, she starred in Bright Eyes and won an Academy Award. One critic wrote, “the enormous charm of Shirley Temple is potent enough to make almost any character do almost anything!”  Mothers enrolled their daughters in tap lessons and curled their hair into ringlets. Shirley Temple products flooded the market; in 1941, $45 million worth of Shirley Temple dolls alone were sold.  President Franklin Roosevelt said, “It is a splendid thing that for just fifteen cents an American can go to a movie and look at the smiling face of a baby and forget his troubles.” She topped the box office for several years and was so famous that when her mother took her to a department store to meet Santa Claus, “he asked me for my autograph.”"
25671,"George Tames's photograph pictures politician Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (left) and civil rights activist Stokely Carmichael laughing together in a congressional office corridor. Born thirty-three years apart, Powell and Carmichael represented two different generations in the campaign for civil rights. Powell-the son of Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Sr.-was New York City's first black congressman, having been elected to that office in 1944. From this position, Powell became famous for fighting segregation in the military, public education, and organized labor. During the 1960s especially, he helped to develop and pass a number of important civil rights bills. Raised in New York City, Carmichael shared Powell's commitment to civil rights. As the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) beginning in 1966, Carmichael conducted his work principally in the streets, rather than in the halls of Congress."
25677,"Rufus King was one of the last of the Founding Fathers. A delegate from Massachusetts to the Continental Congress, an active framer of the Constitution, minister to Great Britain, opponent of the War of 1812, senator from New York, and the Federalist Party's last candidate for the presidency (overwhelmingly defeated by James Monroe in 1816), King had a public career that extended through the administrations of the first six presidents of the United States. His portrait was painted in 1819-20, a time when he tried to rouse opposition to the admission of Missouri as a slave state, defending before the Senate ""the natural liberty of man and its incompatibility with slavery in any shape."" John Quincy Adams recorded: ""He spoke with great power, and the great slaveholders . . . gnawed their lips and clenched their fists as they heard him.""  "
25717,"During World War II, John Steinbeck noted that there were two conflicts being reported in the press. The one getting the most attention was about grand strategy and generals, and the other was the war of the common soldier. No journalist told that latter story more poignantly than Ernie Pyle. His chronicling of the enlisted man's discomforts, terrors, and heroism touched civilians and G.I.s alike. By 1944, he was as much a war hero as any combat medal winner.  When Pyle died while covering the taking of the Pacific island Ie Shima, soldiers marked the spot with a sign declaring that they had ""lost a buddy.""  "
25731,"In explaining the transformation of the American presidency from the limited executive of the Constitution to Lincoln’s expansion of the office, historians point to Thomas Jefferson and Andrew Jackson. However, James K. Polk may have been the strongest president in antebellum America. Polk, the youngest to occupy that office up to that time, had his cabinet officers sign a form letter agreeing to support his program and made it clear that although he desired harmony, ""I intend to be myself President of the U.S."" He confronted the two most difficult boundary issues in American history. In the matter of the disputed northern border, Polk looked John Bull ""straight in the eye"" and secured more of the Oregon Territory than the British wanted to give up. On the southern border, his resoluteness, seen by many as bellicosity, led to war with Mexico, resulting in the new American states of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona."
25784,"Born Vendrell, Spain     Born in Catalonia, Pau Casals was the twentieth century’s foremost cellist and a spokesman for democracy and peace. The son of a musician, Casals studied cello, piano, and composition in Barcelona and started touring in 1900. By age thirty he had performed extensively throughout Europe, Russia, and the Americas. Back in Catalonia in the 1930s, he recorded his signature J. S. Bach Suites for Unaccompanied Cello, lifting them from the mere status of studies to that of masterpieces. With the victory of Francisco Franco’s regime after the Spanish Civil War (1936–39), Casals went into exile. He served in refugee relief efforts during World War II and advocated in the 1950s for the end of atomic weapons testing. From 1955 until his death he lived in Puerto Rico, where he founded the Festival Pablo Casals of classical music, which endures.   Known for his experimentalism in printmaking and his progressive politics, Antonio Frasconi made numerous portraits of social justice leaders and musicians through his career. "
25847,"Soon after assuming the presidency, President Kennedy approved a CIA plan originating with his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, for toppling Fidel Castro with an army of Cuban refugees who had been covertly trained in the U.S. But within hours after the start of the ""Bay of Pigs"" invasion on April 17, 1961, Castro's army defeated the refugees on the beach where they landed. The fiasco exposed Kennedy to harsh criticism. Some lambasted him for not providing air cover for the amphibious landing, others just for endorsing the invasion. Kennedy moved rapidly to gain support from Eisenhower. In this photograph, JFK and Ike walk the grounds of Camp David. Publicly Eisenhower declared that Kennedy acted wisely, but privately Ike, who knew something about amphibious invasions, was bitter about Kennedy's rejection of air cover and called him a ""profile in timidity and indecision.""  "
25974,"As the Manhattan Project for developing an atomic weapon took shape in the months following America's entry into World War II, Robert Oppenheimer's prominence among physicists inevitably drew him into the effort. By late 1942, he was presiding over the project's laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Over the next three years, his skill in encouraging cooperative openness on a staff heavily peopled with arrogant geniuses and his own remarkable ability to absorb new data became crucial to the project's progress. But when success finally came, with the explosion of the world's first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer's sense of triumph was mixed with sadness. All he could think of, he later recalled, was a passage from the Hindu poem ""Bhagavad Gita"": ""I am become Death, the shatterer of Worlds."""
25985,"“Let us have faith that right makes might. . .”    On February 27, 1860, Lincoln held an overflow crowd at New York’s Cooper Union spellbound as he delivered a careful, comprehensive, and eloquent elucidation of the Republican Party’s opposition to slavery, ending with a near-biblical plea of moral conviction. His speech convinced his audience that he was not a country bumpkin but a serious constitutional thinker and an eloquent representative for the party. Before the speech, Lincoln had his portrait taken by Mathew Brady, and this picture became known as the “photograph that made Lincoln president.”   "
25986,"Allen Ginsberg’s photograph of William Burroughs pictures the thirty-nine-year-old writer in 1953, the year his first novel, Junkie, was published. This thinly veiled autobiographical tale of an ""unredeemed drug addict"" offended many readers on account of both its grim subject matter and its hallucinogenic, stream-of-consciousness literary style. Burroughs’s next novel, Naked Lunch, originally published in Paris in 1959, was equally controversial for its unabashed rendering of heroin use and gay sexuality. Banned in the United States for several years, it solidified his reputation as one of the formative members of the Beat generation. A quiet, deeply private man, Burroughs wrote knowingly about alienation from the social norm and defiance of authority and helped to lay the foundation for the cultural dissonance of the 1960s. He once remarked that his purpose was ""to make people aware of the true criminality of our times, to wire up the marks."""
26007,"In the spring of 1861, Ulysses Grant hardly seemed destined for greatness. Having resigned his army captain's commission in 1854, this West Point graduate was eking out a living as a clerk. But the Civil War marked a dramatic shift in his fortunes. Reenlisting in the army, he was soon made a general. By war's end, he was commander of all Union land forces and, as the chief architect of the South's defeat, had become one of the country's heroes.  Grant's popularity led to his election to the presidency in 1868, but his weak control over his administration spawned an outbreak of federal corruption that made ""Grantism"" synonymous with public graft. Nevertheless, his charisma persisted through his two terms.  Grant posed for this portrait shortly after he returned from a triumphant world tour following his presidency. The largely self-taught artist Thomas LeClear painted two versions. This one was originally owned by Grant himself, while the second one became part of the White House collection.  "
26023,"With its African American origins reaching back to the days of slavery, the ""blues"" had been around for a long time when W. C. Handy began using it as the basis for his own musical compositions in the early 1900s. But Handy gave the blues a twist that substantially broadened its appeal, and the publication in 1914 of his ""St. Louis Blues"" marked a watershed in the transformation of blues into one of American music's most important strands. A musician and music publisher as well as a composer, Handy continued to broaden popular appreciation for African American music traditions, and by the 1920s he was widely known as ""Father of the Blues."" Among the many testimonials paid to him on his sixty-fifth birthday in 1938 was a Hollywood concert featuring fifteen renditions of ""St. Louis Blues"" by fifteen different bands. "
26026,"In his decision to “go South” instead of remaining with the Union, Lee never made any larger statements about Confederate nationalism, just as he never said much about slavery or other issues. Instead he pitched his decision as the result of the atavistic appeal of his home soil over larger, abstract, claims of the nation. Once in the army, Lee kept his attention firmly on the Old Dominion. He resisted attempts to move elements of his army to other theaters, and he rebuffed any attempts that he be transferred to another command. His main contributions to Confederate grand strategy were his two invasions of the North, which attempted to drive the Union out of his home state and force a negotiated peace. The emphasis on the battles fought by Lee, and the glamour that has accrued to him, has given short shrift to the way that the Union dominated in the West and Southeast, with many of its signal victories won by U. S. Grant.  Robert E. Lee     En su decisión de “ir al sur” en lugar de permanecer con la Unión, Lee nunca realizó mayores declaraciones sobre el nacionalismo de la Confederación, y nunca dijo mucho sobre la esclavitud u otras cuestiones. En cambio, guió su decisión como resultado de la atávica atracción a su tierra natal sobre las mayores y abstractas demandas de la nación. Una vez en el ejército, Lee mantuvo firmemente su atención en el Viejo Dominio. Resistió los intentos de mover elementos de su ejército a otros escenarios y despreció cualquier intento de ser transferido a otro cargo. Sus principales contribuciones a la gran estrategia de la Confederación fueron sus dos invasiones al norte, que intentaron expulsar a la Unión de su estado natal y forzar una paz negociada. El énfasis en las batallas peleadas por Lee y el glamour que se le atribuía, destinó poca atención a la manera en que la Unión dominaba en el este y el sudeste, con muchas de las notables victorias ganadas por U. S. Grant.     William Sartain (1843 – 1924), en el estilo de Mathew Brady  Mezzotinto, c. 1865  National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution"
26176,"“Hendrick” Tejonihokarawa was one of the Mohawk leaders, or sachems, who traveled to Queen Anne’s court in the spring of 1710 to request British support in territorial battles against the French. He is often confused with sachem Hendrick Peters Theyanoguin (c. 1691–1755). Recent scholarship discusses these two powerful individuals’ joint efforts to negotiate a place for the Mohawk and the Iroquois Confederacy in the volatile North Atlantic world.  Tejonihokarawa’s visit to England was documented in multiple painted portraits that Queen Anne commissioned from John Verelst, among others, and disseminated widely in prints such as this mezzotint by John Simon. Tejonihokarawa is presented here as a diplomat and peacemaker, holding a wampum belt rather than a weapon."
26177,"Although any fictitious face would have passed as a likeness of Washington at the start of the American Revolution, an authentic image, based on a 1776 portrait by Charles Willson Peale, soon spread rapidly in prints and illustrations. Peale's own modest little mezzotint engraving of ""His Excellency Gen. Washington"" featured a long nose, almond-shaped eyes, and curls of hair at either side. That face was copied so frequently over the next two decades-appearing in engravings, books, magazines, almanacs, broadsides, and children's primers-that Washington's contemporaries recognized even the crudest versions. Various prints by engraver John Norman added cannon, banners, drums, and swags to the Peale image and were subsequently copied in relief for such ephemeral publications as The Federal Almanack. This unprecedented dissemination of a famous face suggests that Washington's legendary symbolic status began during his own lifetime."
26207,"Born New York City  In the 1930s, James Cagney was Warner Bros.’ highest-grossing star. He mainly played gangsters, but appeared as a hoofer in Footlight Parade and Something to Sing About.   Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), a patriotic film biography of Broadway great George M. Cohan, allowed Cagney to dance full-throttle. He also adjusted his own Irish clog to incorporate Cohan’s idiosyncratic, strutting tap style.  The film’s premiere in May 1942 came in the early days of America at war, and reviewers raved about “the spirit of Americanism” that Cohan’s flag-waving music embodied. Cagney’s performance “glowed with energy,” and the film was said to convey “both superb entertainment and inescapable inspiration.”  In the final scene, Cagney/Cohan—emerging from a conversation with President Franklin Roosevelt—taps down a marble staircase at the White House. The title tune surges, and hearts swell. Even in black and white, it’s a red-white-and-blue finale."
26234,"In a time when musicians were seen as leaders in a cultural revolution, this pill-shaped poster, highlighting the drug-related deaths of Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin at tragically young ages, questioned the lifestyle choices of such trendsetters. Hendrix shot to fame with his groundbreaking guitar playing. Joplin, a bluesy rock singer with a powerful voice, electrified audiences with her explosive performance style. Their deaths in 1970 propelled the emerging anti-drug movement, which would eventually lead to President Richard Nixon declaring a war on drugs in 1971 and creating the Drug Enforcement Administration in 1973. The juxtaposition of these popular icons with the question ""Winner?"" summarizes the grip of the era's drug culture and the beginning of a concerted effort to curtail its power."
26267,"Aimee Semple McPherson's mother was determined from early on that her daughter should dedicate herself to the work of God. Yet she had little inkling of just what that meant for American religion. By her mid-twenties, armed with a theatrical flair and limitless energy, McPherson was traveling the East Coast, stirring up religious fervor wherever she stopped. Before long, she had her own magazine and was crisscrossing the entire country, preaching several times a day and leaving in her wake countless stories of miraculous faith healings. Cynics dismissed her, but they could not deny her extraordinary power to hold audiences spellbound.  When she posed for this portrait in the Gerhard Sisters' St. Louis studio, McPherson was in midst of a multicity gospel tour, preaching to overflow audiences three times a day."
26296,"As playwright Arthur Miller stands here in this photograph in the doorway of a New York theater in late 1946, the only staged play that he could list in his credentials had been a total flop. But All My Sons, his new drama about a man who sacrifices principle in pursuit of wartime profits, was in rehearsal, and at its Broadway opening a few months later, Miller found himself proclaimed a ""genuine new talent."" The tributes to Miller became warmer yet with the premier of his Death of a Salesman in 1949. One critic proclaimed it ""a great play of our day""; another said that its production provided one of those rare moments when ""all is right and nothing is wrong."" With that, Miller took his place as one of the foremost American playwrights of his time."
26323,"On paper, the New Deal programs enacted to ease the economic sufferings of the Depression were open to everyone, but in practice, racial discrimination often kept African Americans from sharing in their full benefits. A black educator and founder of Bethune-Cookman College, Mary McLeod Bethune was determined to correct that inequity. As an official in the National Youth Administration, she proved remarkably effective in assuring blacks access to its employment programs. But her efforts did not stop there. In 1936 she was the chief organizer of a group of Washington-based African American leaders known as the ""black cabinet,"" whose self-appointed mission was to maintain steady pressure on the federal government to create better job opportunities for blacks.  Bethune had no physical need for the cane she holds in her portrait. She used it, she said, to give herself ""swank.""  "
26323,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
26335,"Twentieth president, March-September 1881    Through repeated balloting at the Republican convention of 1880, delegates remained deadlocked in naming a presidential candidate. Finally, after thirty-five ballots, they were ready for a compromise. Rejecting both front-runners-James Blaine and Ulysses S. Grant-the delegates endorsed Ohio congressman James A. Garfield, whose aspirations had been limited to becoming a senator.  The patronage-driven factionalism that led to Garfield's nomination continued to fester following his assumption of the presidency. On July 2, 1881, angered that Garfield had not awarded him a public office, a member of a GOP faction shot the president as he went to board a train. Eleven weeks later, Garfield was dead from his wound.  This staid portrait by Norwegian artist Ole Peter Hansen Balling may have captured Garfield's physical traits accurately, but it did not convey his spellbinding impact on people. Having once been a lay preacher, Garfield was at his most impressive when speaking. According to one observer, his thoughts sometimes seemed to issue forth at the podium ""like solid shot from a cannon.""  "
26337,"When Franklin D. Roosevelt took the presidential oath in March 1933, his wife Eleanor entered the White House declaring that she was ""just going to be plain, ordinary Mrs. Roosevelt. And that's all."" The promise was not long kept. Soon Eleanor Roosevelt was deeply engrossed in the politics of her husband's New Deal. Touring the nation's depression-ridden communities, she returned to Washington to promote federally sponsored planned communities. She made speeches and gave press conferences where she addressed such matters as child labor and sweatshops. Most important, she was her husband's conscience, urging him toward measures that he might otherwise have avoided in the name of expedience. As she herself put it after FDR's death, ""I think I sometimes acted as a spur even though the spurring was not always welcome."""
26374,"Director Elia Kazan's 1954 film On the Waterfront, depicting the gritty life of mob-ruled longshoremen, was nominated for twelve Academy Awards and won eight, including a Best Actor Oscar for Marlon Brando. In this Italian poster, designer Anselmo Ballester placed a terrifying baling hook in the foreground and added blood, a gun, and a looming mob to suggest the violent melodrama of the picture. The striding figure of Brando as ex-boxer Terry Malloy conveys more than just the film's story line. At nearly life size, it also expressed the actor's powerful physical intensity, grace, and sexual magnetism. In his early films, Brando ""strode through American popular culture like lightning on legs,"" one critic wrote. His ""method"" approach to acting influenced many, and the electric presence he brought to his troubled characters projected an attitude-conflicted and vulnerable-that spoke to the disaffected youth of the postwar period."
26463,"Diana Ross achieved international stardom as the lead singer of the Supremes. With songs such as ""Where Did Our Love Go"" and ""Stop in the Name of Love,"" the Supremes became the most successful female group in pop music history; during the 1960s, only the Beatles sold more records. Bruce Davidson's photograph pictures Ross in 1965 in Detroit's Motown Records studio between the other two members of the famous singing trio- Florence Ballard (left) and Mary Wilson (right).Described as a ""total entertainer,"" Ross electrified audiences with a voice that could put ""swerves into the most unsupple lyrics."" In 1970 she left the group to pursue a solo career as a singer and an actress. Ross's portrayal of singer Billie Holiday in the 1972 film Lady Sings the Blues received a Best Actress Oscar nomination."
26464,"As heir to a modest fortune, Peggy Guggenheim never had to work. By her late thirties, however, she had tired of her aimless bohemian existence in Europe, and in 1938 she opened an art gallery in London. Soon she was an avid advocate and collector of such contemporary artists as René Magritte, Georges Braque, and Alberto Giacometti. When she moved her gallery to New York in the early 1940s, she offered an array of European modernism such as the American art world had rarely seen. Although the gallery lasted only until 1947, it exercised substantial influence. Through her patronage of such artists as Jackson Pollock, Guggenheim provided significant impetus to American art's most significant contribution to mid-twentieth-century modernism-Abstract Expressionism.  This photograph shows Guggenheim in her New York apartment. Behind her is The Break of Day, a surrealist painting by Paul Delvaux from her own collection. "
26547,"Born Dinwiddie County, Virginia    A veteran of the War of 1812 and a hero of the Mexican War, General Winfield Scott, the Union's senior commander at the start of the Civil War, had served under fourteen presidents, beginning with Thomas Jefferson. Yet Scott, seventy-five, once known as ""Old Fuss and Feathers"" for his strict attention to military codes of dress and conduct, was now in declining health; gout and dropsy, coupled with the corpulence of his six foot, five inch frame, had reduced him to being an armchair general, no longer able to ride a horse.  Still, Scott's mind was alert and focused on military matters. Although his ""Anaconda Plan""-which would blockade the enemy's seaports and divide the Confederacy in two by taking control of the Mississippi River-was seen to be largely impractical at the start, it ultimately proved to be a winning strategy for the Union."
26553,"Born Whitingham, Vermont    Brigham Young converted to Mormonism in 1832, and gradually rose in the leadership structure until he became the head of the Twelve Apostles under Joseph Smith. After Smith’s murder by an anti-Mormon mob in 1844, Young assumed leadership of the larger portion of the church. In 1847 he led the Mormons from Nebraska to the Great Basin in Utah, where he founded Salt Lake City as the new church headquarters. He oversaw the migration of tens of thousands of Mormon converts to the West and the founding of hundreds of settlements. The Mormon majority elected Young as governor, but he was soon replaced by an appointed territorial governor. Political conflicts and challenges to the Mormons’ separatist communal and theocratic venture led the United States to dispatch troops to Utah in 1857 and assert federal authority. "
26563,"As commander in chief of the Texas army during the Texas Revolution in 1835-36, Sam Houston led the forces that secured Texas's independence from Mexico. Wounded at the climactic Battle of San Jacinto, he was elected shortly thereafter as the first president of the new Republic of Texas. In this position Houston encouraged the annexation of Texas to the United States, a decision that legislators ultimately agreed upon in 1845. The following year he was elected to the first of three terms in the U.S. Senate. This autographed photograph shows Houston at the end of his Senate career, a period when he worked hard to preserve the Union during the fractious years before the Civil War. Elected governor of Texas in 1859, he was removed from office two years later when-Texas authorities having voted to secede-he refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy.  "
26671,"At the First Battle of Manassas in July 1861, the unrelenting vigor with which Confederate General Thomas Jonathan Jackson held his position inspired a general nearby to rally his troops with the cry, ""There is Jackson standing like a stone wall."" From that moment on, he was known as ""Stonewall"" Jackson, a name that he repeatedly lived up to, fighting under the command of General Robert E. Lee.  The deeply religious Jackson believed intensely in the righteousness of the southern cause, and a key to his success was his ability to instill his own fighting fervor in his men. One of his most brilliant victories came at Chancellorsville in the spring of 1863. Tragically for Jackson and the South, this would prove to be his last battle, as he died of wounds accidentally inflicted by his own men."
26736,"Telling his wife, whom he left in France, that ""the welfare of America is ultimately connected with the happiness of all mankind,"" the nineteen-year-old Marquis de Lafayette arrived to fight for the cause of liberty in early 1777. His moment of glory came during the Yorktown campaign, when he cut off General Cornwallis's path of retreat. An appreciative Virginia legislature commissioned his bust, and Lafayette is seen here in the uniform of a major general in the Continental army, displaying the badge of the Order of the Cincinnati, the fraternal society which united Washington's officers."
26869,"Showman Phineas T. Barnum opened the curtain on modern mass entertainment. He dazzled in the era before technology facilitated the broadcasting of performance-just before the advent of the recording, radio, and motion picture industries; before the rise of the advertising industry; before the mass distribution of photography in the new rotogravure sections of the Sunday newspapers. Yet Barnum still succeeded with such orchestrated events as the introduction of the diminutive General Tom Thumb in the 1840s, the American tour of songbird Jenny Lind in 1850-51, and the creation, in 1881, with James Bailey, of the Barnum & Bailey Circus."
26904,"The polarizing issue of slavery and its extension into the West is the crux of this political cartoon depicting the presidential candidates in 1860. In their attempts to cross “Salt River,” Abraham Lincoln teeters on a rail balanced by the abolitionist Horace Greeley. Stephen Douglas, the champion of popular sovereignty, a doctrine that lets voters decide their region’s political and economic destiny, is falling off of the “Non Intervention” rope, while President James Buchanan carries John C. Breckenridge across the rope labeled “Slavery Extension.” John Bell and his running mate, Edward Everett, stand on the “Constitutional Bridge,” proclaiming that it is “the only structure that connects these two shores [North and South] in an indissoluble bond of union.”   The name “Blondins” in the title refers to the Frenchman Charles Blondin, who created a sensation in the summer of 1859 when he crossed the Niagara River repeatedly on a tightrope. "
26905,"Politics and religion were the two great preoccupations of public culture in nineteenth-century America and were reflected in everything from great public debates to the smallest aspects of personal conduct. Politics was intensely partisan, and citizens followed politics with the fervor of modern sports fans. Voting rates were very high, and political campaigning was designed not only to get out the electorate but also to bind voters to a particular party. Parades, illuminations, and visual displays of all kinds, including this banner for the 1844 Democratic national ticket, all involved voters in the rituals of popular democracy. Widely disseminated by campaign machines, printed materials had helped revolutionize democratic politics by the middle of the nineteenth century. "
26947,"The son of a prominent Howard University law professor, Charles H. Houston attended Harvard University Law School, where he edited the Harvard Law Review, and graduated in 1922. Between 1929 and 1935, he served as vice dean of Howard University Law School. A member of the NAACP legal staff, he was the architect of numerous decisions striking down segregation in labor unions (1944), higher education (1938 and 1945), and housing (1948). His success in prosecuting those cases developed the strategy that led to the landmark Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education (1954), which declared that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional."
26947,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
26971,"Thomas Eakins's photographs and portrait of the aged poet were not well liked by Whitman's admirers. Yet the poet praised them, especially the photographic series of 1888, saying, ""they are honest."" Complementing these pictorial studies of Whitman's decline were a series of farewell poems that Whitman wrote as he prepared to take leave of this world. ""After the Supper and Talk"" (1887) begins         after the day is done,     As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging,     Good-bye and Good-bye with emotional lips repeating  and ends:        O so loth to       depart!     Garrulous to the very last.   "
27061,"Born Los Angeles, California  During a long career as attorney general and governor of California, and then as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren profoundly changed his views on race. In the 1920s he was a member of a number of nativist organizations and possessed a particular hostility to Asian Americans. After the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he enthusiastically supported the internment of Japanese Americans. Then, as governor (1943–53), he surprised Californians by becoming a progressive Republican. President Dwight Eisenhower appointed Warren as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court in 1953, expecting a moderate on such issues as race. But in the Court’s historic 1954 decision Brown v. the Board of Education, Warren placed himself in the vanguard of those fighting for racial equality. Writing for the Court, he declared, ""In the field of public education the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place. Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal."""

27070,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    One of the outstanding voices of the twentieth century, contralto Marian Anderson-like many African American artists of the time-first achieved success in Europe. Impresario Sol Hurok convinced her to return to America, and a triumphant 1935 concert secured her reputation. In 1939 she became embroiled in a historic event when the Daughters of the American Revolution banned her appearance at its Constitution Hall because she was black. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt intervened and facilitated Anderson's Easter Sunday outdoor concert at the Lincoln Memorial-an event witnessed by 75,000 and broadcast to a radio audience of millions. In 1955 Anderson was invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera, becoming the first African American to sing an important role with that company.    Laura Wheeler Waring painted this portrait for the Harmon Foundation, an organization that promoted appreciation of African American heritage. The picture was part of a collection of likenesses that the foundation circulated around the country for many years."
27093,"Much of the blame for Washington’s lack of defense fell on the shoulders of Secretary of War John Armstrong, who had recklessly dismissed the notion of a British attack on the capital. Although he was a Revolutionary War veteran, diplomat, and U.S. senator, Armstrong was not well liked. Despite his experience and connections, he suffered from the reputation of ""indolence and intrigue."" It was said that his ""nature and habits forbid him to speak well of any man."" In the days after the burning, Armstrong stubbornly refused to accept any responsibility for the outcome. He had a surprising confrontation with the ""great little Madison,"" who rebuked the secretary for the city’s demise. Armstrong resigned, indignant. ""It is obvious,"" Armstrong wrote, ""that if all the troops assembled at Bladensburg had been faithful to themselves and to their country, the enemy would have been beaten and the capital saved."" "
27094,"Clint Eastwood established his acting reputation in a series of westerns and police dramas beginning in the late 1950s. As a tough loner who never hesitated to confront his enemy, he crafted a stoic acting mode that favored action over words. As a bounty hunter known as the “Man with No Name,” he established his trademark scowl in a trilogy of spaghetti westerns starting with A Fistful of Dollars (1964). As Harry Callahan in Dirty Harry (1971), Eastwood became an icon of urban backlash, often playing violent characters who chafe under the law. As a director, he made films in which the line between good and evil is often a matter of perspective, such as Unforgiven (1992). Yet his earliest heroes were jazz musicians: the first film Eastwood directed was about a jazz DJ, and he made the first biopic about a black jazz musician, Bird (1988). Philippe Halsman’s photograph of Eastwood holding a .44 Magnum was the poster likeness used to promote Dirty Harry."
27122,"Born New York City  Until Eugene O’Neill turned to writing drama in the early twentieth century, American plays had consisted largely of forgettable comedies and romantic melodramas. O’Neill broke with that tradition and, through his staged probing into the human condition, became the first American dramatist to achieve lasting recognition.  Raised in a theatrical family, the reclusive O’Neill experienced his first major triumph in 1920 with the New York production of his Pulitzer Prize–winning Beyond the Horizon. In the next ten years, he enjoyed many other successes. But his most enduring achievements were the plays he wrote toward the end of his life, among them Long Day’s Journey into Night and The Iceman Cometh.   The strong, spare lines and bold forms of this print convey O’Neill’s brooding personality. This is one of a series of color prints that Harry De Maine made in the 1920s, based on drawings by etcher and caricaturist William Auerbach-Levy."
27214,"The reverse of this medal is similar to those created for the presidents from Thomas Jefferson through Zachary Taylor: two clasped hands—Euro-American (with a uniform sleeve) and Indian (with a crossed pipe and tomahawk)—and the words “PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP.”    El reverso de esta medalla es similar a los que se crearon para los presidentes desde Thomas Jefferson hasta Zachary Taylor: dos manos entrelazadas, una euro-americana (dejando ver el puño de un uniforme) y una indígena, coronadas por una pipa y un hacha cruzadas y con las palabras “PAZ Y AMISTAD”.

27238,"President Richard Nixon's plan to end the Vietnam War combined exploratory negotiations with a fierce military campaign to drive the North Vietnamese to the peace table, if not actually to win the war. In addition, to help quell domestic unrest about the draft and casualty rate, a campaign began in which ground fighting was gradually to be taken over by the South Vietnamese. After fractious negotiations between the United States, North Vietnam, and South Vietnam, and against the backdrop of fierce fighting, the Paris Accords, which combined American withdrawal with democratic elections in South Vietnam, were signed on January 27, 1973. However, military conflict continued unabated until April 1975, when a concerted North Vietnamese offensive overthrew the South Vietnamese government. On April 28, President Gerald Ford ordered the withdrawal of all American personnel; the Saigon government surrendered two days later.  "
27256,"In this 1864 photograph, Union cavalry General Philip Sheridan stands beside his headquarters’ flag in the company of his division officers. The exact location is unknown, but that fall he was making a name for himself as his army began winning control of Virginia’s verdant Shenandoah Valley. This was an indispensable breadbasket for the Confederacy, which Sheridan systematically put to the torch. His victory at Cedar Creek, near Winchester, in mid-October earned him lasting fame and provided an important win for the Lincoln administration, which was seeking political momentum on the eve of the presidential election."
27313,"Having worked on cattle ranches as a young man growing up in the Midwest, actor William S. Hart brought a degree of authenticity to his roles as a western cowboy and an outlaw. An accomplished stage actor on Broadway, Hart moved to California in 1913 to act in The Bargain, the first of more than thirty western-themed movies in which he starred. Hart wanted his films to be as realistic as possible, and he insisted on performing his own stunts. In many of these works, crooked government officials interfere with the business of settling the frontier-a not-so-subtle commentary on contemporary western politics. By the mid-1920s, movies with more action, younger actors, and less symbolism eclipsed Hart's films. This portrait of Hart holding a revolver and wearing a Mountie-style hat and scarf captures the classic cowboy image that he popularized during the 1910s and 1920s."
27370,"The image of President Richard Nixon shaking hands with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev appeared on Time's cover on the eve of the 1974 Moscow summit meeting. Nixon hoped that this summit would advance the policy of détente-the easing of Cold War tensions-and also divert attention from the growing Watergate scandal. Watergate began when men on the payroll of Nixon's reelection campaign broke into Democratic National Committee headquarters. Mounting evidence of Nixon's direct involvement in the cover-up following the break-in had diverted his and the nation's attention away from foreign affairs. A sign of Nixon's diminished effectiveness was the increasing boldness with which critics challenged his foreign policy. One of his fiercest foes, Democratic senator Henry Jackson, is pictured here trying to pull Nixon away from Brezhnev. The Moscow summit ended with no strengthening of détente.  "
27377,"Rarely in presidential politics have two men representing the same party been so dissimilar as the 1836 Democratic candidate, Martin Van Buren, and his running-mate, Richard Mentor Johnson. Van Buren was a gentleman of refinement and a savvy New York politician, a master of political circumspection who never gave cause for offense. Johnson, a Kentuckian, paid no heed to the social etiquette of his day and lived openly with his mulatto slave, claiming two children by her, much to the consternation of his constituency. Yet both men, particularly Van Buren, enjoyed the patronage of outgoing president Andrew Jackson, whose popularity influenced the election in their favor. Typical of vice presidents at this time, Johnson never played an active role in Van Buren's single-term administration and became a liability largely because of his lifestyle. This 1840 reelection broadside, however, reminded voters of Johnson's credible military service in the War of 1812. "
27476,"Ornette Coleman #1   At some point in the mid-1960s, Elaine, who had always been fond of jazz, made a series of drawings of Ornette Coleman (born 1930) with his saxophone. The album Free Jazz (1961) by the Ornette Coleman Double Quartet—with its lengthy track and freewheeling, atonal, and discordant sound—changed the shape of jazz.  Through erasure, stumping, and improvisational graphite lines, Elaine created drawings that capture Coleman’s likeness while giving a visual sense of jazz’s rhythm and movement. She made at least three likenesses: this improvisational sketch, a drawing focused entirely on Coleman’s disembodied head (displayed to the right), and a more finished image that includes Coleman’s hands and his saxophone (in a private collection).    En algún momento de mediados de los sesenta, Elaine, eterna aficionada del jazz, hizo una serie de dibujos de Ornette Coleman (nacido en 1930) con su saxofón. El álbum Free Jazz (1961) del Ornette Coleman Double Quartet, con sus largas pistas y su sonido libre, atonal y discordante, cambió el rumbo del jazz.  Valiéndose de borraduras, difuminados y líneas improvisadas en grafito, Elaine creó dibujos que captan la imagen de Coleman y transmiten una sensación visual del ritmo y el movimiento del jazz. Hizo por lo menos tres retratos: este boceto improvisado, un dibujo de la cabeza sin cuerpo de Coleman (mostrado a la derecha) y una imagen más terminada que incluye las manos y el saxofón (ahora en una colección privada)."
27574,"Bertram Hartman  1882-1960    Kansas-born artist Bertram Hartman, posing with arch solemnity in a studio littered with cats and portfolios, was once well known in the artistic circles of New York and Paris. A close friend of writer Ernest Hemingway and artists John Marin, Gaston Lachaise, and William and Marguerite Zorach, Hartman exhibited his oils and watercolors alongside works by prominent American modernists. Critics admired the multiple perspectives and cubist patterning of his landscapes and skyscrapers, and particularly liked his watercolors. ""Forms, light, and patterns of color interplay in sweeping rhythms,"" one reviewer noted. Hartman used the same playful repetition of geometric shapes to animate this wry, attenuated self-portrait. The artist was also recognized for his batik textiles, book illustrations, stained glass, mosaics, and designs for rugs hooked by his wife. Ultimately his reputation suffered when he abandoned his decorative designs to focus exclusively on mural and easel painting."
27671,"Born New Rumley, Ohio  In June 1861—just two months after the start of the Civil War—George A. Custer graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point and entered the Union army as a second lieutenant in the Second Cavalry. One of the army’s rising stars, Custer was only twenty-three when he became the youngest officer promoted to brigadier general, in 1863. By the war’s end, his conspicuous bravery and battlefield daring had earned him the rank of major general in Philip Sheridan’s cavalry corps. Custer was still a West Point cadet when he posed for this portrait holding his Colt pocket pistol."
27727,"When FDR officially declared his willingness to be the Democrats' presidential standard-bearer for a fourth time, his long-delayed declaration of availability surprised no one. When Wendell Willkie, Roosevelt's Republican opponent in 1940, heard about it, he asked, ""Is that news?"" After all, Roosevelt had already broken with precedent by seeking a third presidential term in 1940, and it was obvious that he did not intend to leave office until he had seen the country to final victory in World War II.  "
27754,"In this sketch Volck satirizes the lives of ""free negroes"" in the North. The well-dressed man in the center offers a tract on slavery to a beggar instead of alms, while nearby, a physician bargains with two black men over a dead body, probably to be used for dissection. They stand just outside a ""Colored Home,"" in which scenes of riot and orgy are taking place. Volck, in the most graphic way, raised questions that seemed to ask if free blacks in the North were really better off than slaves in the South."
27784,"Born Louisville, Kentucky(?)     “Yet do I marvel at this curious thing,/to make a poet black and bid him sing!” With these words, Countee Cullen described the ambiguous position of the black artist in American society in the 1920s. By the age of twenty-two, Cullen had graduated with honors from New York University and completed Color (1925), his first volume of verse. He would become a leading figure of the literary and artistic movement known as the Harlem Renaissance. Winold Reiss’s portrait of Cullen appeared in the “Harlem” issue of Survey Graphic magazine, an overview of the Harlem Renaissance that would be republished as The New Negro. Here, Reiss conveys the poet’s introspection with tilted head and averted glance. Celebrating Cullen’s literary accomplishments, the portrait also captures the progressive spirit of the Harlem Renaissance and its quest for a new social awakening. "
27888,"Thirty-third President, 1945-53    The occasion for this Time cover portrait was President Harry Truman's dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur as commander of United Nations forces in the Korean conflict in April 1951. MacArthur's public criticism of Truman's refusal to expand Korean military operations into China-which was aiding Communist North Korea in its war on South Korea-clearly undermined Truman's credibility as commander-in-chief. Yet Time was not sympathetic to Truman's viewpoint and believed that MacArthur's criticisms were justified. While declaring MacArthur ""the personification of the big man,"" Time described Truman as ""almost a professional little man.""   Truman's cover portrait was the work of the Russian-born artist Boris Chaliapin. Capable of producing a meticulous likeness in a matter of hours, Chaliapin was for years the artist Time used when it needed one of its portraits completed on short notice.    Time cover, April 23, 1951"
27902,"President Theodore Roosevelt's dynamic view of the presidency infused vigor into a branch of government that had been dominated by Congress during the last three decades of the nineteenth century. His personal energy mirrored his executive activities. Riding and hiking were almost daily pastimes; one senator joked that anyone wishing to have any influence with the president would have to buy a horse.   This photograph by Peter Juley of Roosevelt dressed in his riding clothes appeared on the cover of Harper's Weekly on July 2, 1904.  "
27925,"Carte de visite portraits of Confederate generals <Edmund Kirby Smith>    During the Civil War, the Union blockade of southern ports effectively halted the flow of most goods, including materials needed by Confederate photographers to continue their operations. Although some photographic supplies were smuggled through, by January 1862 it was reported in the North that ""the Photographic Art down South has completely died out in consequence of the war."" Because southern cameramen had virtually ""nothing to work with,"" photographs representing Confederate leaders, such as these portraits of Generals Jubal A. Early, Edmund Kirby Smith, and Fitzhugh Lee, typically circulated in the form of retouched copy images produced in the North by firms such as E.& H.T. Anthony rather than as original life portraits created in the South."
27948,"Born near New London, Connecticut    Born into the Mohegan tribe, Samson Occom became a convert to Christianity during the evangelical movement known as the Great Awakening. Often called the ""pious Mohegan,"" Occom devoted his life to bringing the gospel to Native Americans in New England and New York. He was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1759 and undertook various missionary activities in the years prior to the American Revolution. Particularly noteworthy was his 1765 trip to Great Britain, during which he delivered more than 300 sermons to raise money on behalf of a school for Native children run by his former mentor, Eleazar Wheelock. Wheelock ultimately used the money to help establish Dartmouth College in 1769. To Occom's disappointment, Dartmouth was organized as a school for white missionaries.   This mezzotint by the English engraver Jonathan Spilsbury is based on a lost painting by Mason Chamberlin created during Occom's visit to Great Britain.

28002,"Born Ithaca, New York     By the early 1960s, Alex Haley had interviewed such prominent figures as Miles Davis and Martin Luther King Jr. for Playboy magazine; in 1965, he collaborated with Malcolm X in writing The Autobiography of Malcolm X, the acclaimed memoir of the civil rights activist. But it was Haley’s 1976 work about his ancestors, Roots: The Saga of an American Family, that made him a household name.  This charcoal portrait by artist/author Barnaby Conrad Jr. depicts a thoughtful Haley two years before the publication of his Pulitzer Prize–winning book. Conrad became acquainted with Haley while teaching creative writing, later introducing him to the agent who would eventually publish Roots. In 1977 the television miniseries based on the book captivated a record-breaking 130 million viewers. Although the book has since been acknowledged for weak historical scholarship, its significance is irrefutable, marking a sea change in the national understanding of African American history and genealogy."
28007,"Born Kingston (formerly North Kingstown), Rhode Island     Sarah Goodridge, a New England miniaturist who took informal instruction from Gilbert Stuart in the early 1820s, painted this miniature at Stuart’s request around 1825. He was then the most famous artist in Boston, and Goodridge was taken with his formidable personality and craggy features. As Stuart’s daughter recorded, “[Goodridge] seemed to be quite overcome at the idea. . . . [The miniature] is the most life-like of anything ever painted of him.” Goodridge made at least three nearly identical miniatures, and the image was engraved.   "
28026,"As a central figure in framing the Constitution, James Madison had a good deal of influence over shaping the American presidency. But helping to conceive that office did not guarantee success in occupying it, and much of Madison's own presidency was marred by his inept handling of the War of 1812 and the bitter criticism that it engendered. Derisively labeled ""Mr. Madison's War,"" the conflict, one commentator railed, had been ""commenced in folly . . . carried on with madness, and . . . will end in ruin.""  The advent of peace in late 1814, however, mellowed feelings toward Madison. Although many of the issues that had spawned hostilities remained unresolved, the war had produced enough military glory to satisfy national pride. In the process, Madison emerged as the American David who had dared to take on the British Goliath.  In 1829, Madison came out of retirement to attend a convention for revising Virginia's constitution. While there, he posed for this portrait by the Massachusetts painter Chester Harding.  "
28216,"Theodore Roosevelt posed for this photograph at Montauk, Long Island, shortly before his First Volunteer Cavalry Regiment-which fought in Cuba during the Spanish-American War-was mustered out of service in September 1898. Later, Roosevelt described in a letter how he looked and dressed in the war. Unlike his image here, he said, ""In Cuba I did not have the side of my hat turned up.""  "
28332,"It Talks! It Sings! It Laughs! The startling assertions of this poster undoubtedly attracted the curious to demonstrations of Thomas Edison's newly invented phonograph. In 1878, after filing his patent, Edison went to Washington, where he had his portrait made at Mathew Brady's photography studio and showed off his ""talking machine"" at the Capitol, the White House, and the American Academy of Sciences. The same year, five hundred demonstration models of his phonograph toured around the country on the lyceum circuit.   This large wood-engraved poster, with a blank space over the Brady image for inserting the specific time and place for the demonstrations, is similar to the color posters that promoted circuses. It tells us more about the man than the machine, which was eventually redesigned. Far from being a lone genius, Edison was a famous personality, and his ability to stay in the public eye was an important factor in his career."
28383,"Born Hardin County, Kentucky  As the fledgling Republican Party’s candidate for the U.S. Senate from Illinois in 1858, Abraham Lincoln challenged Democratic incumbent Stephen A. Douglas to a series of debates on the issues. Lincoln ultimately lost the election, but his debates with Douglas propelled him to national prominence. Two years later, Lincoln was elected president. This portrait was taken by a local photographer in Monmouth, Illinois, on October 11, 1858, two days before the sixth debate. After the sitting, Lincoln indulged the photographer’s six-year-old son William by taking him ""next door and fill[ing] him up with candy and figs."""
28481,"  Time's cover for January 27, 1975, addressed what the magazine reported as ""the worst economic slump since the Great Depression."" What today may seem like a familiar story against the backdrop of the latest recession, the crisis thirty-five years ago was being fueled by runaway inflation at a rate of almost 14 percent and a ""dangerous dependence"" on foreign oil. In his State of the Union address, President Gerald Ford had declared flatly that ""the State of the Union is not good"" and that he did not expect ""much, if any, applause."" Ford's proposed cure was a ""three-stage operation"" involving tax rebates, tax cuts, and new energy taxes. In this caricature, artist Mort Drucker adapted the medical analogies employed in the cover story: Ford is depicted dressed in a surgical gown and is working frantically alongside Speaker of the House Carl Albert to revive what appears to be a deathly ill patient.

28484,"Endowed with high-minded and spiritual inclinations as well as beauty, Ruth St. Denis moved twentieth-century dance from the realm of variety shows to a serious art form. Stimulated by an interest in Eastern philosophy and mysticism and, reportedly, a 1904 cigarette poster with an Egyptian motif, St. Denis created a new form of theatrical dance, incorporating exotic costumes, contemporary music, innovative choreography, and inspirational themes. From 1906 onward, St. Denis and her company toured the United States and Europe, performing a series of dances based on Eastern motifs. In 1915 she and her husband, Ted Shawn, opened the Denishawn School in Los Angeles, where they trained such young dancers as Doris Humphrey and Martha Graham. For this photograph, St. Denis collaborated with Vanity Fair photographer Adolph de Meyer to recreate the illusion of modern dance in two dimensions.  "
28520,"The first casualties of the War of 1812 resulted from Americans fighting Americans. On the night of July 27, 1812, Baltimore erupted into violent riots against those who opposed the weeks-old war, including Revolutionary War hero ""Light-Horse Harry"" Lee. Lee found himself barricaded in a house with supporters of a Federalist newspaper editor who had spoken out against war. When the mob attacked, the besieged men defended themselves, causing the death of a ringleader and further inciting the pro-war mob. Near morning, city leaders finally intervened, escorting the Federalists to jail for their own protection. That night, angry citizens broke in and brutally attacked the men, killing sixty-year-old veteran James McCubbin Lingan. Lee was smuggled out of the city and survived, although he never recovered from his wounds. He died six years later, when his son Robert E. Lee was only eleven. "
28581,"The media frenzy of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago centered foremost around the nominated candidates—Hubert Humphrey for president and Edmund Muskie, his surprise choice for a running-mate. But it also focused on the turbulent demonstrations that enveloped the convention venue and appalled the nation watching on television. The presence of thousands of antiwar demonstrators had been expected. Consequently, Chicago mayor Richard J. Daley, “the last of America’s big-city bosses,” assembled a security detail of 23,000 police, national guardsmen, and federal troops to maintain order. What shocked viewers worldwide was the “breakdown of police discipline” as “they flailed blindly” with billy clubs “into the crowd of some 3,000 then ranged onto the sidewalks to attack onlookers.” Daley, whose image is seen in the background of this cover, defended his city’s response by noting that no one was killed.  La papeleta demócrata     El frenesí mediático que generó la Convención Nacional Demócrata de 1968 giraba en torno a los candidatos nominados: Hubert Humphrey para presidente y Edmund Muskie, su inesperado compañero de papeleta. Pero también acapararon la atención las turbulentas protestas que rodearon la sede de la convención y conmocionaron a la nación que las observaba por televisión. Esperando la llegada de miles de manifestantes contra la guerra, el alcalde de Chicago, Richard J. Daley, “el último gran jefe” entre los alcaldes del país, reunió un contingente de 23,000 policías, guardias nacionales y tropas federales para mantener el orden. Lo que consternó a los televidentes de todo el mundo fue el “colapso de la disciplina policíaca” mientras los oficiales “repartían golpes a ciegas” con sus macanas “entre unos 3,000 manifestantes para luego atacar a los que observaban desde las aceras”.

28583,"Edmonia Lewis achieved international recognition as a sculptor during the second half of the nineteenth century. Educated at Oberlin College, she settled first in Boston, where she created portrait busts and medallions of prominent politicians, writers, and abolitionists. In 1865 she relocated to Rome and joined an active community of American and British artists living abroad. Adopting a neoclassical style then widely popular, she found inspiration in stories from the Bible and classical mythology, as well as from African American history. Her sculpture Forever Free (1867) depicts an African American couple as they first hear news of the Emancipation Proclamation. The work led one critic to exclaim, ""No one, not born subject to the 'Cotton King,' could look upon this piece of sculpture without profound emotion."" Although Lewis enjoyed unprecedented success for several decades, she died in obscurity."
28584,"The oldest of the Beat poets, Lawrence Ferlinghetti played the role of founding father and elder statesman with wit and good humor. After service in the U.S. Navy, he settled in San Francisco and its burgeoning art scene. There he co-founded City Lights Books, one of the most famous imprints in American poetry. He also published the magazine Beatitude, whose title suggested both a sense of grace and the political imperatives of the Beat generation. ""Beat"" was not entirely affirmative: it signaled a sense of resignation and fatigue. (""We’re beat."") Ferlinghetti demonstrated a manic quality in which outrageous euphoria and madcap schemes, fueled by experiments with various mind-altering drugs, oscillated with black moods of despair. He could not sustain the pitch of rage that animated Allen Ginsberg; he was not wholly consumed by politics, which perhaps made him a more interesting, if not greater, poet. "
28720,"Born The Gambia, Africa    Phillis Wheatley was the first African American to publish a book and the first American woman to earn a living from her writing, no small feat considering that she came to the colonies as a slave. Although most slaves had no opportunity for an education, within two years of Wheatley's purchase in 1761, she had learned to read and begun to write poetry. Her book Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773), published in London, drew the praise of Washington, Franklin, and Voltaire and helped Wheatley gain her freedom. The frontispiece engraving emphasized Wheatley’s demure appearance and creative intelligence."
28723,"This caricature of Chester Arthur, drawn by noted political satirist Thomas Nast, appeared on the July 16, 1881, cover of Harper's Weekly. The depiction appeared two weeks after President James A. Garfield was shot and mortally wounded by a deranged office seeker. It was especially embarrassing for Arthur because at the time he had been furthering the interests of his own New York State political machine called the Stalwarts. Led by Roscoe Conkling and Thomas Platt, the Stalwarts were actively fighting certain presidential appointments President Garfield was proposing. (Arthur is depicted shining his cronies' shoes.) Yet upon his assumption to the presidency, Arthur, to his credit,  distanced himself from the system of political patronage in which he had risen. By signing the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883,"" which endorsed a  nonpolitical system based on merit, he ironically became known as ""The Father of Civil Service."". "
28782,"Paul Colin and Le Tumulte Noir    The jazz age had taken hold in Paris and with it, le tumulte noir, an intense fascination with black culture. African sculpture had inspired such artists as Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso; African American ragtime and jazz stimulated avant-garde composers; dancers were captivated by the Cakewalk, the Black Bottom, and the Charleston. Many people perceived in non-Western art forms a ""pure"" and intuitive creative impulse, in contrast to the overrefined artifice of white European culture. African American expatriates fleeing segregation at home were welcomed.   In 1927 Paul Colin published his portfolio Le Tumulte Noir, featuring forty-five lithographs with pochoir, or stenciled, color, in an edition of 500. Colin's dynamic images were inspired by cubism and art deco modernism. Several lithographs directly evoke Baker's slim form, costumes, and energetic dancing. Others feature jazz bands, prominent white music-hall entertainers depicted as black, or amusing images of the French attempting new dances.    Le Tumulte Noir is not without racist overtones drawn from imagery prominent in American and European popular culture. Nonetheless, it does not just celebrate the ""primitive""; its tone is more admiring than condescending. "
28923,"Born Adrian, Mississippi   Visionary industrial designer Norman Bel Geddes was best known for creating the Futurama exhibit at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. He helped popularize the streamlined aesthetic in the 1930s and 1940s by designing products ranging from sleek cocktail shakers to teardrop-shaped cars. The 1939 fair was dedicated to ""building the world of tomorrow,"" and Bel Geddes’s installation at the General Motors pavilion showcased a one-acre scale model of a futuristic city populated by 500,000 buildings and 50,000 cars that moved on automated highways. Spectators sat above the diorama on seats that moved along a conveyor belt to give them an airplane-like view of the city. The exhibit drew crowds of 30,000 visitors a day and was the smash hit of the fair. Another lasting Bel Geddes contribution was the book Magic Motorways, a 1940 study that foreshadowed the Interstate Highway System."
28935,"Poet, novelist, playwright, and songwriter Langston Hughes was one of the most prolific and versatile writers in the history of African American letters. With the publication in 1926 of his first volume of verse, The Weary Blues and Other Poems, he emerged as a figure of national prominence. Although at times faulted for his use of dialect and for dwelling on the negative aspects of his race's experience in America-a Chicago critic once labeled him the ""poet 'low-rate' of Harlem""-Hughes created moving works that transcended the unpleasant realities he portrayed. Born into humble circumstances, he identified with ""low-down folks"" and praised them for maintaining ""their individuality in the face of American standardizations."" Yet his work also showed the influence of literary modernism, a tradition to which he contributed. This portrait was created in California on the occasion of a reading at the artists' colony in Carmel."
28936,"Born Hanover County, Virginia  Between 1820 and 1850, charismatic statesman Henry Clay championed a series of legislative compromises that for a time forestalled the breakup of the Union. Clay’s first success as a mediator and conciliator came with ratification of the Missouri Compromise (1820), which preserved the existing balance of slave and free states. In 1833, when South Carolina challenged federal authority and threatened to secede, it was Clay who crafted the compromise that averted this crisis. His crowning achievement in mediating the opposing interests of the North and South came during his final term in the Senate, when he orchestrated passage of the Compromise of 1850."
28938,"Hilda Doolittle met Ezra Pound as a young woman and became one of his first great protégées. He was the one who named her, signing her work “H. D. Imagiste” when her poems were sent to the publisher. Pound played a crucial role, as he did with T. S. Eliot, in editing and cutting Doolittle’s verse, paring it down to the bare essentials of word and meaning, rather like his reduction of her name to two letters. Pound’s editing came with a cost, however; Doolittle bridled against male control, whatever its literary benefits.              Doolittle had an exotically tempestuous and dramatic private life that gave her no peace, and she underwent treatment from Sigmund Freud. Worshipped by many, she became poetry’s acolyte as a way out of making meaning out of life’s vicissitudes. Doolittle hoped for the escape offered by the forest nymph Oread, whom H. D. urges in her poem to “hurl your green over us, cover us with your pools of fir.”"
28956,"Born Raleigh, North Carolina     Andrew Johnson was a self-educated tailor living in Greeneville, Tennessee, when he launched his political career in 1829. Beginning as a town alderman, he eventually held offices as mayor, governor, and U.S. congressman and senator. In 1861, at the start of the Civil War, Johnson was the only southern senator to remain loyal to the Union. The next year, Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Largely for his efforts “to eradicate all pro-Confederate influences in the state,” Johnson was tapped to be Lincoln’s running mate in the 1864 election. "
28957,"One of the most agile minds of the Confederacy was encased in the gaunt and consumptive frame of Alexander Hamilton Stephens. No other southern statesman better embodied the paradoxical elements inherent in the new nation itself. During his long tenure in Congress, Stephens had been a staunch Unionist, a devotee of the nationalist ideology of Daniel Webster over the sectionalism of John Calhoun, and a friend and supporter of his Whig colleague Abraham Lincoln. When secession came, however, he cast his destiny with his native Georgia and accepted the Confederate vice presidency. In one of the most notable speeches of the hour, he proclaimed that slave ownership and its underlying assumption of racial inferiority was the ""corner-stone"" on which the new republic rested.  "
28964,"In 1841, teacher, humanitarian, and reformer Dorothea Dix launched a vigorous campaign to secure humane treatment for those afflicted with mental illness. At a time when such individuals were more often imprisoned and abused than cared for and treated, Dix became a tireless advocate for their welfare. Personally investigating the ""cages, cellars, stalls, [and] pens"" where sufferers were confined, she reported her findings in speeches and articles, and in petitions she submitted to lawmakers. Thanks to her efforts, facilities for the mentally ill were greatly expanded and improved. This daguerreotype alludes to the role that writing played in Dix's work by picturing her with pen and paper at hand.  "
29010,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
29066,"For its February 25, 1966, cover story on world-renowned pianist Arthur Rubinstein, Time editors assigned a small team, one of whom followed Rubinstein around for ""just over three weeks"" as he performed a series of concerts from Toronto, Canada, to Columbia, South Carolina. ""The process,"" reported Time, ""was not unlike covering a war or an election or an ecumenical council. . . . Most Time stories are handled with such intensity."" Boris Chaliapin was part of that team effort, only his contribution was extraordinary because he routinely worked mostly from photographs to produce his art. Not so with Rubinstein, whose finished portrait was based on life sittings. Time published a photograph of one of these sittings, showing the prolific artist, brush in hand, and the accomplished musician seated nearby. Topics of discussion between the two invariably included Chaliapin’s famous father, the great Russian operatic basso Feodor Chaliapin, with whom Rubinstein had been friends many years prior. "
29075,"Mary Todd married Abraham Lincoln much against the wishes of her relatives, who considered him socially inferior. But she was perhaps the first to realize Lincoln's potential for national leadership.  This photograph of Mrs. Lincoln, wearing a meticulously fashioned black dress, may have been taken in the autumn of 1863. She would have been still in mourning for her eleven-year-old son, Willie, who had died of typhoid fever in February 1862. His death, followed three years later by the assassination of her husband, precipitated her rapid psychological decline, which continually worsened during her lifetime."
29096,"Midway through the first term of Ronald Reagan's presidency, Time magazine ran this cover and an accompanying story, titled ""How Reagan Decides."" At the time, Reagan and his chief advisers were preparing a budget with a proposed deficit of about $155 billion, more ""than twice as large as any recorded by a previous administration"" and contrary to Reagan's major tenets of restrained government spending and balanced budgets. In spite of the record-high tallies, in Reagan's mind he was not violating his long-held principles, but rather working toward them in the long run. He believed that his tax cuts, ""slashes in social spending,"" and a revived economy would soon shrink the deficits. Reagan's reelection in 1984 was yet another testament to his optimism and to his uncanny ability to communicate with the American people.

29148,"Katharine Cornell once confessed that she never stopped suffering from stage fright and noted that it ""got worse as the years went on."" Here was compelling proof indeed of the constructive powers of pre-performance jitters. Writing at Cornell's death, one critic who had watched her over many years claimed that whenever she stepped onto a stage ""something electric happened."" Even when she was cast in a mediocre piece, her performance could leave audiences with an illusion that the play was really quite worthwhile. Among her most celebrated roles was Elizabeth Barrett in The Barretts of Wimpole Street. In it, said one reviewer, her acting was ""as remarkable for the carefulness of its design as for [its] fire.""  Cornell appears in this photograph dressed for her part in George Bernard Shaw's The Doctor's Dilemma. "
29178,"John D. Rockefeller may have been a model for many aspiring businessmen, but he was mercilessly lampooned in artists' and writers' caricatures. Henry Major, for instance, shows him in profile, humorously highlighting his wizened features. In a verbal caricature in Vanity Fair entitled ""See the Conquering Heroes,"" a journalist lampooned Rockefeller as ""a man of sufficient private means to employ two golf caddies-one to carry his bag and one to beseech him, by all that is oily, to keep his head down.""   "
29214,"Born Colts Neck Township, New Jersey  From 1933 to 1938, radio’s ""Town Crier"" opened his CBS radio program by ringing a bell and shouting ""Hear ye, hear ye. . . . This is Woollcott speaking."" What followed was a mélange of gossip about show business and literature that drew on Woollcott’s position as a New York Times drama critic, New Yorker columnist, and member of the Algonquin Round Table of wits. Woollcott was a larger-than-life personality, and his ""Town Crier"" program won a large following because he was such an animated storyteller. He became the inspiration for Sheridan Whiteside, the main character in George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart’s play The Man Who Came to Dinner, and he even starred in the role himself. One critic said that he ""can persuade you there are truffles on his tonsils."" In January 1943, Woollcott had a heart attack while broadcasting and collapsed at the microphone; he died four hours later."

29324,"As befitting his nickname, Robert ""King"" Carter was arguably the most powerful Virginian during the first third of the eighteenth century. First elected to Virginia's House of Burgesses in 1691, Carter actively involved himself in politics, twice serving as Speaker of the House and once as governor. Like many Virginians, he was proud of his English heritage, yet was also passionate in defending Virginia's rights within the British empire. As a merchant and tobacco planter, Carter amassed one of the largest fortunes in colonial America. At his death he owned 300,000 acres of land-roughly half the size of Rhode Island today-and oversaw the operation of forty-five plantations and more than 700 slaves. In this portrait, he conveys the self-assured sense of independence that was characteristic of those Virginians who would later revolt against their English rulers.  "
29344,"Born St. Louis, Missouri  When she debuted at Paris’s Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in 1925, nineteen-year-old Josephine Baker created a sensation that rivaled the explosion that Sergei Diaghilev’s ballet The Rite of Spring sparked on that same stage in 1913.  A fascination with Africa and a rage for American jazz permeated Paris after the horrors of World War I, and “Negro Vaudeville” was greatly in vogue. Capitalizing on this fervor, young Baker was brought from New York City to star in La Revue Nègre. Her appearance was such a success that she was soon engaged by the Folies Bergère, where her signature performance was a dance in which she wore nothing but a belt of bananas.  Baker was also adept at cultivating her exotic public image offstage, endorsing beauty products and strolling down boulevards with her pet cheetah, Chiquita.   She melded the spirit of the moment into her own: “Paris is the dance, and I am the dancer!”"
29367,"Family was vitally important to Theodore Roosevelt, both personally and for his political philosophy. He was proud of his family’s genealogy and had been nurtured in the harmonious household of his parents. The importance of family was driven home to him by devastating losses: first the death of his father at an early age, then the staggering simultaneous passing in 1884 of both his wife, Alice, and his mother. Mourning, he withdrew to his ranch in the Dakotas. In 1886 he returned to New York City and to politics and also married Edith K. Carow, who raised his daughter, Alice Roosevelt Longsworth. They had five children of their own between 1887 and 1897. A large family was emotionally necessary for Roosevelt, and it also undergirded his political view that western civilization depended on a strong birth rate."
29517,"A member of one of New York's great landowning families, Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania-where he had set up his law practice-at the Constitutional Convention of 1787. As chairman of the committee on style, Morris saw to it that the ""whole of the Constitution"" was ""expressed in the plain, common language of mankind.""   Morris had a deep-rooted distrust of the masses and a tenacious regard for the rights of private property, yet he was well ahead of most of his contemporaries in calling for absolute religious liberty and the abolition of slavery. ""In adopting a republican form of government,"" Morris reflected in 1802, ""I not only took it as a man does his wife, for better or worse, but what few men do with their wives, I took it knowing all its bad qualities.""  "
29575,"No writer at midcentury conveyed the outrage felt by African Americans about racial injustice more passionately than James Baldwin. Soft-spoken, physically slight, and gay, Baldwin devoted his writing career to an investigation of the deep-seated inequalities in American society. In novels such as Go Tell It on the Mountain (1953) and essay collections such as Notes of a Native Son (1955), he described a society unhinged by the problem of race. ""No society can smash the social contract and be exempt from the consequences,"" he once wrote. To Baldwin, racism was an illness centered in white society that only the power of love could eradicate. Though he longed for a more tolerant society, the bigotry in his midst caused him to relocate to France in 1948. He returned periodically and during the 1960s became an influential though reluctant spokesman for the burgeoning civil rights movement."
29600,"On October 9, 1973, Spiro Agnew, facing bribery and tax evasion charges, resigned the vice presidency. Although Nixon first wanted to nominate John Connally (who had switched parties to be his secretary of the treasury) to replace Agnew, the president knew that it would require a lengthy confirmation battle in Congress. Nixon and Gerald Ford had been good friends since they both entered Congress. A well-respected, hard-working congressman, Ford was loyal to Nixon, and most important, he would be quickly confirmed.   This cartoon shows Agnew walking on a tightrope, with Nixon, who was no longer supporting his vice president, on one side and George Brooke Beall, who was investigating Agnew, on the other side. Speaker of the House Carl Albert, who denied Agnew's request for a trial in the House of Representatives, is holding up the Constitution. "
29622,"This photograph was taken at the 1972 Republican convention, in which Richard Nixon was nominated for a second term. Nelson Rockefeller, the four-term governor of New York, and Reagan, the two-term governor of California, had been serious contenders for the 1968 Republican presidential nomination, representing, respectively, the party’s liberal and conservative wings. While commentators believed that Nixon’s most serious challenge in 1968 would come from Rockefeller, Nixon himself most feared a Reagan challenge. In 1972, with Nixon headed to a landslide victory, the consensus of pundits—reflected in a Newsweek story entitled “Ronald Reagan’s Slow Fade”—was that Reagan’s political career would end in Sacramento. His political demise, to paraphrase Mark Twain, was greatly exaggerated: in 1976 Reagan mounted a serious challenge to President Gerald Ford’s nomination.    "
29655,"Born Jamestown, New York  Best known for delighting television audiences with her hilarious antics, comedienne Lucille Ball had hoped to make her mark as an actress on the big screen. From 1929 to 1950, she appeared in more than seventy films, but Hollywood stardom remained elusive. Weary of roles that offered steady work but little satisfaction, Ball was delighted when CBS offered her the chance in 1950 to star in a new television show based on her radio program, My Favorite Husband. When she proposed casting her husband, Desi Arnaz, as her costar, CBS balked at the idea of pairing Ball with the Cuban-born bandleader. The network relented after the couple agreed to pay for and produce the show’s pilot through their own newly formed company, Desilu Productions. A huge hit with the public when it debuted on CBS in October 1951, I Love Lucy proved to be the perfect showcase for Ball’s comedic talents."
29662,"Casey Stengel built his reputation as one of baseball's greatest managers by guiding the New York Yankees to ten American League pennants and seven World Series championships in just twelve seasons (1949-60). But it was during his stint as the charismatic shepherd of the fledgling New York Mets (1962-65) that Stengel earned a place in the hearts of baseball lovers everywhere. Unable to budge his hapless team from the National League's cellar, Stengel nonetheless helped the Mets amass legions of loyal fans, thanks to his memorable quips, his tireless zest for the game, and his confident prediction that ""the Mets are gonna be amazing."""
29798,"The presidential election of 1860 was the second time that Stephen Douglas had faced Abraham Lincoln in a political contest. The first had occurred in 1858, when Lincoln unsuccessfully tried to take Douglas's seat in the U.S. Senate. This carving is thought to be a memento of that occasion, and its unknown maker probably intended it as a mate to a similar surviving carving of Lincoln. A contemporary once described Douglas as a ""lively five-footer full of brains, bounce, and swagger."" Despite its primitive aspect, the carving seems to bear out that description."
29802,"Born Salinas, California     Although he was a great contributor to American literature, John Steinbeck retreated from fame. This portrait of the author by James Fitzgerald was executed in 1935, the same year that Steinbeck’s first commercially successful novel, Tortilla Flat, was published. Steinbeck claimed to be “scared to death of popularity,” saying “it has ruined everyone I know.” In the 1930s and 1940s, both Steinbeck and Fitzgerald belonged to a loosely organized group of artists, writers, and intellectuals in Monterey, California. Although they often argued violently, both men respected each other’s talent and shied away from public recognition. Steinbeck’s famed novels Of Mice and Men (1937) and The Grapes of Wrath (1939) earned him even more acclaim, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1962. Fitzgerald expresses Steinbeck’s reclusive personality by casting half of the author’s face in dark shadow."
29853,"Duke Ellington was a jazz pianist and America’s greatest composer. He maintained his cool through an elegant aristocratic front that refused to recognize the country’s entrenched racism. Born and raised in the nation’s capital, Ellington established a national audience with a residency at Harlem’s Cotton Club. He wrote dance songs, three-minute concertos, spiritual works, thematic compositions about black life and culture, classics of the American songbook, and extended suites featuring Asian and Latin American motifs. His main instrument was his orchestra: he wrote for musicians as individuals. When he left space on the music score to improvise (""ad lib here""), he validated jazz as a democratic musical form. In 1965 he was denied a Pulitzer Prize by a judge who refused to give it to a black man. ""Fate doesn’t want me to be famous too young,"" was his diplomatic reply. He is still worshipped by musicians the world over."
29995,"In her younger days, Dorothy Day had sympathized with the ideals of socialism and communism. After her conversion to Catholicism, though, she sought to express her reformer's impulse in ways more in keeping with her new religious convictions. In the early 1930s, she co-founded the Catholic Worker, a newspaper dedicated to redressing injustice while promoting the communal values of Christianity. As the paper's circulation soared to 150,000, Day and her allies began implementing its editorial message by making the New York tenement that housed its offices into a refuge for the poor and hungry. Soon similar Catholic Worker ""Houses of Hospitality"" sprang up across the country. Day's dedication to improving the human condition led some to call her ""a saint."" She had no patience with that, however, claiming that ""when they say you are a saint what they mean is that you are not to be taken seriously."""
30110,"Civil War sheet music  Civil War music usually fell into one of several categories: songs to rally the troops, spirituals sung by enslaved peoples, songs sung by families at home, and songs that reflected the homesickness many soldiers felt. The sheet music covers displayed here commemorate the lives of Confederates Jefferson Davis, Simon B. Buckner, and Stonewall Jackson, and Union general Ambrose Burnside."
30125,"On April 4, 1968, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed by an assassin's bullet in Memphis, Tennessee, where he had gone to organize a march in support that city's striking sanitation workers. The murder that deprived the nation and the world of an unparalleled champion for civil rights also deprived King's four children of a beloved father. When King lay in state in Atlanta at Sisters Chapel, Spelman College, thousands of mourners paid their respects as they passed his open casket. Photographer Benedict Fernandez was there to record the moment when five-year-old Bernice King, flanked by her older sister Yolanda and brother Martin Luther King III, first caught sight of her father's body. Bernice's shocked expression serves as a reminder that while King's death was a loss for the world, it was deeply personal tragedy for his young family."
30195,"One of the enduring myths of America is that it has no history but exists in the liberating freedom of the present moment. Nathaniel Hawthorne's novels, fables, and ""tales"" were a cautionary lesson to Americans who ignored the past. (Hawthorne knew the more optimistic writers represented in this room but was friends with none of them.) His writings secularized the harsh Puritan worldview of his Salem birthplace to remind Americans that actions had consequences, both for individuals and communities. His novels turn on the clash of the individual will-from the lovers in The Scarlet Letter (1850) to the naive philanthropist of The Blithedale Romance (1852)-against the implacability of society and nature. Hawthorne's sympathies are often with his rebels, but his philosophy requires their defeat. It was perhaps the irreconcilability of these viewpoints that led to his artistic decline in the 1850s.  "
30197,"Today Abraham Lincoln is universally regarded as one of our greatest presidents. But from the start of his administration, Lincoln, guiding the nation in a time of civil war, was beset with criticism from all sides. Some charged him with moral cowardice for initially insisting that an end to slavery was not one of his wartime goals; others accused him of overstepping his constitutional powers; still others blamed him for military reverses in the field. But as Union forces moved toward victory, Lincoln's eloquent articulation of the nation's ideals and his eventual call for an end to slavery gradually invested him with grandeur. Following his assassination in 1865, that grandeur became virtually unassailable.  The original version of this portrait was a template for artist George P. A. Healy's large painting The Peacemakers, depicting Lincoln in consultation with three of his main military advisers at the end of the Civil War. But Healy recognized that this made a fine portrait in its own right and eventually made three replicas, including this one.  "
30215,"After helping his sons to found the Meade Brothers daguerreian business, Henry Richard Meade took an active part in the enterprise during its formative years. But when the brothers opened their gallery in New York City in 1850, their father’s role appears to have lessened. It was not until two years after Charles Meade’s death that Trow’s New York City Directory for 1860–61 identified the senior Meade as a photographer working at the firm’s 233 Broadway address. "
30309,"Since the late nineteenth century, the editorial cartoon has played a provocative role in presidential politics, countering partisan advertising with irreverence. Australian-born Pulitzer-Prize winner Pat Oliphant (born 1935) hones a distinctive, repeatable caricature of each incoming president. When each fails to live up to expectations, those exaggerated figures begin to age, sag, shrink, weaken, or bloat. Oliphant has summarized his cartoon depictions of each president since Lyndon Johnson in a series of bronze sculptures. His images of Richard Nixon as a haunting and malevolent Napoleon, Gerald Ford as Band-Aided hollow mask, Jimmy Carter as an insignificant miniature, and George H. W. Bush as a wizened horseshoe player, remind us of the powerful impact of satiric portraiture.  "
30364,"Garry Winogrand's double portrait of John F. Kennedy accepting the Democratic presidential nomination at Los Angeles's Memorial Coliseum calls attention to one of the most historic developments associated with the 1960 election: the introduction of television as a medium of mass communication. The handsome forty-three-year-old senator from Massachusetts adapted quickly to the demands of the new medium. His success in four televised debates against his visibly awkward opponent, Richard Nixon, proved a decisive factor in his electoral victory in November. The Democratic convention was also memorable for Kennedy's speech. Mindful of the rhetoric of his Democratic predecessors Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry Truman, Kennedy spoke of America ""on the edge of a New Frontier . . . a frontier of unknown opportunities and perils, a frontier of unfulfilled hopes and threats.""  "
30380,"The enfant terrible of postwar American letters, Truman Capote escaped his hardscrabble and scarring adolescence to vault to literary prominence with his semiautobiographical Other Voices, Other Rooms (1946). A coming-of-age novel that dealt explicitly with the protagonist's homosexuality, the book gained notoriety for the jacket photograph of a boyishly sexual Capote lying on a sofa. Arnold Newman's picture mimics that pose by showing the aging Capote surrounded by the trappings of wealth and fame. Perhaps best known for Breakfast at Tiffany's (1958), Capote belied his reputation as a writer of light fiction by producing In Cold Blood (1966), a tautly written account of the murder of an ordinary Kansas family. Calling the book a ""nonfiction novel,"" Capote, along with Norman Mailer, created a new form of American journalism. Thereafter, though, Capote became enmeshed in New York's high society and published only sporadically.  "
30517,"Throughout the 1948 presidential campaign, only Harry Truman's staunchest supporters held out hope that he could prevail against Republican challenger John E. Dewey. Poll after poll predicted a solid Dewey victory, and when early returns on election night showed the Republican in the lead, the banner headline in the early morning edition of Chicago Daily Tribune confidently proclaimed ""DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN."" But the final vote tally told a very different story. To the astonishment of pollsters and pundits alike, Truman scored a stunning come-from-behind victory with 303 electoral votes. After celebrating his triumph at an impromptu gathering in his hometown in Missouri, the president boarded the train for Washington. During a brief stop in St. Louis, where a cheering crowd filled the station, the jubilant Truman held aloft the now-famous newspaper with the erroneous headline.  "
30535,"In 1955, Althea Gibson contemplated retiring from competitive tennis. Had she done so, she would have denied herself her greatest moment. Two years later, this ""lanky jumping jack of a girl,"" who had begun her sports career playing paddle tennis in New York’s Harlem, was arriving home from England, winner of the women’s singles and doubles titles at the prestigious Wimbledon championships. Within another two months, she had won the U.S. women’s singles crown at Forest Hills and emerged triumphant as America’s clay court champion as well. ""Althea Gibson,"" Time told its readers in the wake of these victories, ""is not the most graceful figure on the courts, and her game is not stylish."" Nevertheless, it was clear that at thirty—an age when most tennis players lose their competitive edge—she was still sharp."
30559,"Perhaps the poverty he endured as an immigrant led Jacob Riis to his life's work as a reformer. In 1877 he joined the staff of the New York Tribune as a police reporter and was drawn to stories involving the disadvantaged. Massive immigration from southern and eastern Europe had a profound effect on American cities such as New York, where poverty and squalor were endemic. Riis voiced his outrage over their misery in his masterpiece, How the Other Half Lives (1890). Setting the foundations for modern photojournalism, Riis used technical innovations to photograph the dark interiors of tenements. He formed a close friendship with Theodore Roosevelt, who, as police commissioner and later governor of the New York, worked with Riis to improve tenement conditions. "
30614,"On May 20, 1927, Charles Lindbergh took off from New York in his single-engine Spirit of St. Louis. He landed thirty-three and one-half hours later at Paris's Le Bourget Aerodrome, greeted by 100,000 cheering Frenchmen. His instant fame in Europe was echoed by millions in the United States, and he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Later, before World War II, Lindbergh's admiration for German efficiency and industry, his campaign against America's entry into the war, and his anti-Semitism could not fully dim the luster. The battle of the ""lone eagle"" against the elements and the machine struck a chord in America's psyche that reverberates today."
30657,"In his Memoirs, Grant described how he had a superstitious aversion to retracing his steps when traveling; he kept going forward until he found his way. More colorfully, a staff officer noted that Grant “habitually” looked like “he had determined to drive his head through a brick wall, and was about to do it.” Grant was used to hard slogging, both in the drawn-out siege campaigns he had conducted on western rivers and at battles like Shiloh or Lookout Mountain, when he rallied his troops from near-defeat. He fit his temperament to his method of waging war, telling his commander, “Lee’s army will be your objective point. Wherever Lee goes, there you will go also.” War would not be total in the twentieth-century sense, but it would become continual.  Ulysses S. Grant     En sus Memorias, Grant describió como tuvo una aversión supersticiosa de retroceder sobre sus pasos cuando estaba viajando; siguió avanzando hasta que encontró su camino. Lo que es más interesante, un oficial del personal se dio cuenta de que Grant ""generalmente"" parecía que ""tenía decidido atravesar una pared de ladrillos con su cabeza y estaba a punto de hacerlo"". Grant estaba acostumbrado al agotamiento extremo, tanto en las eternas campañas de sitio que dirigió en los ríos del oeste como en las batallas como Shiloh o en la montaña Lookout, cuando motivaba a sus tropas ante una derrota inminente. Adaptó su temperamento a su método de guerra al decirle a su comandante: “el ejército de Lee será tu objetivo; donde vaya Lee, ahí también irás tu"". La guerra no fue total como en el siglo veinte pero se volvió continua.     John C. McRae (activo 1850–1880)  Aguafuerte y gravado, 1865  National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution"
30669,"Born Whitingham, Vermont    Brigham Young converted to Mormonism in 1832, and gradually rose in the leadership structure until he became the head of the ""Twelve Apostles"" under Joseph Smith. After Smith's murder by an anti-Mormon mob in 1844, Young assumed leadership of the larger portion of the church. In 1847 he led the Mormons from Nebraska to the Great Basin, where he founded Salt Lake City as the new church headquarters. He oversaw the migration of tens of thousands of Mormon converts to the West and the founding of hundreds of settlements. The Mormon majority elected Young as governor, but he was soon replaced by an appointed territorial governor. Political conflicts and challenges to the Mormons' separatist communal and theocratic venture led the United States to dispatch troops to Utah in 1857 and assert federal authority. Young was notorious for his many wives, a practice taught as a religious principle by his predecessor, Joseph Smith."
30705,"Born Florida, New York  William H. Seward was a vocal advocate for reform, first as governor of New York (1839–43) and later as a U.S. senator (1849–61). He argued strongly against passage of the Compromise of 1850, which included a stipulation that the vast New Mexico territory be organized without any prohibition of slavery. Seward instead declared that America’s western territories should remain “unencumbered, and free from the calamities and sorrows of human bondage.” A staunch Republican, he later served as President Lincoln’s secretary of state. On the night of Lincoln’s assassination, Seward nearly lost his life when he was brutally attacked by John Wilkes Booth’s co-conspirator, Lewis Powell."
30708,"Press conference in Birmingham, Alabama, April 11, 1963  After the frustrating stalemate in Albany, Georgia, Martin Luther King and members of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference were determined to see their next effort succeed. On April 3, 1963, following months of careful planning, King initiated a massive desegregation campaign aimed at ""the breaking of racial barriers in Birmingham [Alabama], the most thoroughly segregated big city"" in America. When marchers took to that city’s streets in peaceful protest, they were brutally attacked by police acting on orders from Public Safety Commissioner Eugene ""Bull"" Connor. At a press conference, King declared a state injunction prohibiting further protests to be ""raw tyranny under the guise of law and order"" and announced his willingness to defy it. Arrested on Good Friday, King remained in jail for nine days, during which time he wrote his ""Letter from Birmingham Jail""—an eloquent and brilliantly argued response to those who maintained that racial issues should be left to the courts."
30757,"Elizabeth Catlett created this serial portrait of Angela Davis in 1972 during a period in which the twenty-eight-year-old political radical and university professor was incarcerated and awaiting trial in connection with a shoot-out outside a California courthouse that left a judge and three others dead. Davis had not been present but was alleged to have purchased the guns used in the incident. Catlett admired Davis's activism. Angry that Davis was being held without bail, she organized the ""Free Angela Davis Committee"" and created this print to support the cause. Davis was ultimately acquitted after a trial that made international headlines. Since then, she has continued to champion various social causes, including prison reform."
30857,"Born Nantucket, Massachusetts  Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention that launched the women’s movement in the United States. Both as a Quaker and as a reformer Mott was drawn to the antislavery cause and helped found Philadelphia’s Female Anti-Slavery Society. This experience convinced her that women had a special role in reform movements and that the struggle for women’s rights would be essential in paving the way for future reform causes in America. She urged women to “go on—not asking favors, but claiming as a right the removal of all hindrances to . . . elevation in the scale of being.”"
30881,"    When critic Mary Fanton Roberts urged William Glackens in 1919 to paint a portrait of actor Walter Hampden, the artist found the request startling. ""I have never considered portraiture as one of my best points,"" he wrote her, ""but painting a Hamlet is not exactly portrait painting."" He promised to see the play the next afternoon. Hampden's renowned Hamlet helped establish the actor as the leading Shakespearean on the American stage. This pastel sketch, one of several preparatory studies for the National Portrait Gallery's full-length oil, shows both Glackens's rapid delineation of a characteristic pose-a legacy of his newspaper sketch-artist days-and the lightened palette that critics compared to Pierre-Auguste Renoir. Roberts praised the final portrait for depicting both the ""rarely sensitive soul"" of the actor and the ""spiritual bewilderment"" of the character he played.  "
30882,"One of America's most skilled trial lawyers, Clarence Darrow won national prominence for his successful defense of labor leaders Eugene V. Debs, Thomas I. Kidd, and ""Big Bill"" Haywood. In 1924 he defended Nathan Leopold and Richard Loeb in a sensational murder trial. Darrow had them plead guilty to avoid a jury trial, and his eloquence saved them from the death penalty. A year later he defended John Thomas Scopes, a Tennessee schoolteacher tried for violating a state statute criminalizing the teaching of evolution. Although Scopes was convicted and fined $100, Darrow turned the trial into a defense of science and enlightenment principles.  "
30903,"Born Topeka, Kansas    ""Blackness is what I know best. I want to talk about it, with definitive illustration,"" said writer Gwendolyn Brooks. From her sensitive autobiographical novel Maud Martha to her popular rhythmic poem ""We Real Cool,"" Brooks devoted her work to portraying urban African American life with poignancy, artistry, and pride. During the course of her career, Brooks received two Guggenheim Fellowships and became the first black writer to receive the Pulitzer Prize and earn election to the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Brooks wrote of this sculpture: ""Sara, thank you for extending my life; for sending my life into bronze and beyond."""
30920,"Davidson made this portrait of eighty-one-year-old Nebraska senator George W. Norris at the time of his electoral defeat after forty years in Congress. He and Norris talked about Norris's role in creating the federal government's regional rural electrification project-the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)-the reform measure passed during Roosevelt's first one hundred days in office. Norris spoke of ""the wonder of it [the reform measure] and its possibilities."" Davidson told him about his visit to Norris Dam and his attempt to adapt his figure, The Stemming of the Tides, to the dam that bore Norris's name. Davidson later wrote, ""There was a dignity about this old man."""
30926,"Thirty-ninth President, 1977-81    Early in the presidential election year of 1976, a frequent quip on Jimmy Carter's campaign trail was ""Jimmy Who?"" Yet by November, that sardonic question had been answered in an unexpected way. Not only had this obscure former Georgia governor had not only claimed the Democratic nomination, he had also won the presidency itself. For achieving that ""political miracle,"" he received an unexpected bonus: in its January 3, 1977, issue, Time declared him its Man of the Year. The cover story noted that in keeping with his distaste for pomp, the president-elect intended to forgo the usual morning attire and limousine at his inauguration. Instead, he would wear a business suit and ride to the oath-taking in an unpretentious Ford. The blue-jeaned informality of Carter's Man of the Year cover portrait by Jamie Wyeth anticipated those departures from the formal traditions.     Time cover, January 3, 1977"
30943,"One of America's foremost nature photographers, Eliot Porter helped support the growth of the environmental and ecology movements, especially with the books he published with the Sierra Club. Trained as a biochemist, Porter gave up science for professional photography after receiving encouragement from photographers Ansel Adams and Alfred Steiglitz; Steiglitz launched Porter's career with a one-man show at his famous gallery in 1938. Unlike Adams, Porter worked in color, perhaps because his scientific background attuned him to technical advances in color processing. Porter's popular breakthrough came in 1962, when the Sierra Club sponsored his photographic manifesto on the environment, In Wilderness Is the Preservation of the World. Porter's series of books for the club helped make it America's leading environmental organization. Eliot was the brother of painter Fairfield Porter, who captures him here in a moment of quiet repose."
31089,"Seven Ages of Man  The Meade Brothers exhibited numerous examples of their work at the ""Great Exhibition"" held in New York City’s Crystal Palace (1853–54), including a series of daguerreotypes by Charles Meade illustrating Shakespeare’s ""seven ages,"" as described in Act II of As You Like It. Lauded by the Photographic Art Journal for reflecting ""much talent"" and ""a high degree of cultivated taste,"" the Meade Brothers’ Seven Ages of Man—Infant, Schoolboy, Lover, Soldier, Justice, Pantaloon, and Second Childishness—later circulated in the form of card-mounted photographs known as cartes de visite."
31107,"Henry and Mary Ann Meade   As the daguerreotype was gradually eclipsed by a succession of other photographic processes in the latter part of the 1850s, the firm of Meade Brothers adapted its offerings to accommodate new technologies and changing tastes. Ivorytypes and paper-print photographs were introduced, and in 1861 the gallery’s staff included an ""artist in oil, etc.,"" who could embellish images by hand-coloring them. The work of such a colorist is reflected in this pair of portraits of Henry and Mary Ann Meade."
31286,"Melding lyric poetic forms with the bitter realities of American racism seemed an unlikely combination. But poet-novelist Claude McKay made it work, and Harlem Shadows, his collection of poems published in 1922, is regarded as a major catalyst in unleashing the cultural ferment of the Harlem Renaissance. Of the poems in Shadows, the best remembered was ""If We Must Die."" Inspired by the rash of American race riots in 1919, it ended with the lines ""Like men we'll face the murderous cowardly pack,/ pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!"" The universality of appeal in those eloquently defiant words made this poem a call to action, not only for the emerging American civil rights movement but also for such figures as Winston Churchill, who used the lines to rally the Allies during World War II."
31311,"This cartoon highlights the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas (1813–1861) in the tumultuous 1860 presidential election. The contest—portrayed as a cockfight—is between the Democratic Party’s southern and northern branches. Douglas, from the North, stands on former president Buchanan, crowing that he can beat Abraham Lincoln and ""Old Kentucky too."" Vice President John C. Breckinridge (1821–1875), a Kentuckian who represented the South, is being placed into the ring. The Pennsylvania-born president James Buchanan (1791–1868 ) sided with Southern Democrats and excluded Douglas—the only man who might have avoided the party’s rupture—from his cabinet. Buchanan had hoped to defuse sectional tensions; instead, his failures intensified animosities and split the Democratic Party. At the 1860 Democratic convention in Charleston, South Carolina, Buchanan supporters joined with southerners to prevent Douglas’s nomination, and instead selected Breckinridge. Northern delegates bolted and held a convention in Baltimore, nominating Douglas. With the Democrats divided, the Republican Lincoln won the election. "
31312,"Paul Colin and Le Tumulte Noir    The jazz age had taken hold in Paris and with it, le tumulte noir, an intense fascination with black culture. African sculpture had inspired such artists as Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso; African American ragtime and jazz stimulated avant-garde composers; dancers were captivated by the Cakewalk, the Black Bottom, and the Charleston. Many people perceived in non-Western art forms a ""pure"" and intuitive creative impulse, in contrast to the overrefined artifice of white European culture. African American expatriates fleeing segregation at home were welcomed.   In 1927 Paul Colin published his portfolio Le Tumulte Noir, featuring forty-five lithographs with pochoir, or stenciled, color, in an edition of 500. Colin's dynamic images were inspired by cubism and art deco modernism. Several lithographs directly evoke Baker's slim form, costumes, and energetic dancing. Others feature jazz bands, prominent white music-hall entertainers depicted as black, or amusing images of the French attempting new dances.    Le Tumulte Noir is not without racist overtones drawn from imagery prominent in American and European popular culture. Nonetheless, it does not just celebrate the ""primitive""; its tone is more admiring than condescending. "
31314,"General Lesley McNair’s fondness for academic pursuits inspired one of his superiors to dub him ""the brains of the Army."" On the eve of World War II, McNair was charged with orchestrating the organization and training of all army ground troops. Among the traits that fit him for this task was his willingness to try any new war technique that came to his attention. Sent to Europe in July 1944 to observe the performance of American forces at Normandy, McNair was killed on his first day at the front, the victim of friendly fire from American airplanes.  This portrait appeared on the December 28, 1942, cover of Time magazine with a story that reported McNair’s concern that army inductees were not taking their training seriously enough. He had every faith that American soldiers could learn ""quickly and well in battle."" But that method of education, he warned, was often costly."
31332,"After caricaturist Ralph Barton published an illustration in Vanity Fair highlighting the film-world elite dining at Hollywood's legendary Cocoanut Grove restaurant, the design was chosen for an Americana series of silk fabrics. One young flapper chose the Cocoanut Grove silk to make into this simple frock. Famous profiles of John Barrymore, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and Eddie Cantor pop out of the picture; Charlie Chaplin scurries in late; film industry regulator Will Hays serves as the maître d'hôtel. The dress, still stained from its partygoing career, undoubtedly evoked for its owner the tempo, glamour, and theatricality of metropolitan life. To her elders, though, it must have seemed shockingly revealing of arms and legs.  "
31347,"In 1961, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy brought an elegance and glamour to the White House that has rarely been matched. At times public interest in her seemed to overshadow even that of her husband, President John Kennedy, who during a state visit to France good-humoredly introduced himself as ""the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris."" Her quiet dignity after her husband’s 1963 assassination only increased public admiration for her. In 1968 she married Aristotle Onassis, a Greek shipping magnate. After his death, she had a long career in publishing, remaining an object of popular fascination until her own death.  This likeness appeared on Time’s cover on the eve of President Kennedy’s inauguration in 1961. Mrs. Kennedy was not especially relishing the prospect of being first lady; Time reported that she found it all rather ""frightening."" The baby carriage on the White House balcony is a reference to John F. Kennedy Jr., born on November 25, 1960."
31400,"The decade of the 1960s was an era of inordinate social unrest, especially in cities across the country where African Americans, frustrated by poverty, prejudice, and uncertainty about the future, took to the streets and rebelled. Rioting occurred in the summers of 1964, 1965, 1966, and what Time called the “violent summer of 1967.” The cover story for August 4 reported on Detroit, the nation’s fifth-largest city. During five days of looting and arson that left “skeletons of gutted homes, shops, supermarkets” smoldering over fourteen square miles, “there were 41 known dead, 347 injured, 3,800 arrested,” and some 5,000 people were made homeless. With 2,700 businesses ruined and estimates of $500 million in damages, Time called the mayhem in Detroit “the most sensational expression of an ugly mood of nihilism and anarchy that has ever gripped a small but significant segment of America’s Negro minority.”  Disturbios en Detroit      La década de 1960 fue un momento de suma agitación social, sobre todo en ciudades del país donde la población afroamericana, frustrada por la pobreza, el prejuicio y la inseguridad ante el futuro, se echó a las calles para rebelarse. Los disturbios ocurrieron durante los veranos de 1964, 1965, 1966 y lo que Time llamó el “violento verano de 1967”. El artículo principal del 4 de agosto era sobre Detroit, la quinta ciudad más grande de la nación. Durante cinco días de saqueos e incendios que dejaron humeantes “esqueletos de casas, tiendas y supermercados” en un área de catorce millas cuadradas, “hubo 41 muertos, 347 heridos, 3,800 arrestados” y unas 5,000 personas quedaron sin hogar. Con 2,700 negocios en ruinas y daños estimados en $500 millones, Time calificó este caos de Detroit como “la expresión más dramática de hostilidad, nihilismo y anarquía jamás vista en un segmento de la minoría negra estadounidense que, aunque pequeño, es significativo”.

31401,"Described by a contemporary as ""the apostle of individuality in an age of association and compromise,"" author Henry David Thoreau followed his own moral compass and lived a life largely unfettered by convention. In such works as Walden and ""Civil Disobedience,"" Thoreau encouraged readers to question popular wisdom and to seek universal truths from simple facts. When an admirer wrote from Michigan in 1856 asking for Thoreau's daguerreotype and enclosing money to defray its cost, the author reluctantly obliged. A visit to Maxham's Daguerrean Palace yielded this 50-cent portrait, which Thoreau dutifully sent to the requestor along with $1.70 in change.  "
31423,"Counterclockwise from left: Howard da Silva (1909–1986), Marc Blitzstein (1905–1964), Blanche Collins (1910–1968), Olive Stanton (active 1930s), and Bert Weston (active 1930s)    In 1937, composer Marc Blitzstein made national headlines with his musical The Cradle Will Rock. The strongly pro-union play was directed by Orson Welles and produced by John Houseman for the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Theatre Project. Just as it was to open, word of the play’s ideological slant reached Washington. Congressional conservatives threatened the WPA’s funding. The Federal Theatre Project cancelled the play, and Actors’ Equity told Welles that none of the actors could appear on stage in the production. So Welles and Houseman moved the play to a different site, and had the actors perform from the audience, with Blitzstein narrating at the piano. Columnist Walter Winchell called the play a great ""diversion"" and New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson praised it as ""the best thing militant labor has put into the theatre yet."""
31447,"Elizabeth Bishop seemed able to thrive as a writer precisely because she could draw strength from the instability of her daily life. Writing filled the voids for her. Bishop’s voluminous and sharp-eyed correspondence created a web of relationships on which she could rely. And her hard-earned poems grew, like desert plants, out of the absence of things. Bishop was galvanized by having, she thought, nothing to lose and thus everything to gain. Concluding her poem “One Art,” she breaks the inviolate seamlessness of her verse with a parenthetical exhortation to herself: “the art of losing’s not too hard to master / though it may look like (Write it!) like disaster.” Bishop’s sense of a wound, however it was inflicted—poverty, lack of family, alcohol, depression—meant that she always kept her guard up in her work, writing slowly and meticulously, carefully fashioning the world of words that she could control."

31560,"Billy Martin was always a wild card. As an infielder with the Yankees in the 1950s, he contrasted average regular-season play with postseason sparkle that produced World Series victories for New York in 1952 and 1953. Unfortunately, the combative behavior that cost Martin his job with the Yankees in 1957 remained a liability as he later bounced around the league. After retiring from play in 1961, Martin switched to managing and built a reputation for his ability to turn underperforming ball clubs into winners. Named Manager of the Year on three occasions, Martin won five division titles, two American League pennants, and one World Series championship with the five franchises he piloted. Despite his successes, Martin's volatility on and off the field made it difficult for him to keep a job, and his serial firings by Yankees owner George Steinbrenner became legendary."
31561,"In the spring of 1851, a band of Apache men in present-day Arizona captured thirteen-year-old Olive Oatman and her younger sister. They killed or seriously injured the rest of the family during the attack. At the time, the Oatman family-originally from Illinois-was headed west to California to start their lives anew. Shortly thereafter the Apache sold the two sisters to a Mohave family. While living with this family, Oatman was tattooed on the chin, a custom common among members of the tribe. In 1856, after enduring five years in captivity and the death of her sister, Oatman had her freedom negotiated, and she was given over to authorities at Fort Yuma. Accounts of her release were published widely, and her biography became a best-seller. Though Oatman stated that her Mojave family treated her well, stories such as hers reinforced commonly held assumptions that Native Americans were violent savages. "
31786,"Born Sumner, Missouri    Arkansas senator J. William Fulbright was one of the leading internationalists of the post-World War II era, convinced that the responsibilities of war and peace were too grave for America to retreat into the isolationism that marked the end of World War I. First elected to the Senate in 1944, Fulbright was a fervent supporter of international organizations and treaties such as the Marshall and Truman plans, as well as NATO and the United Nations. Fulbright came to national attention in the 1960s as he broke with President Lyndon Johnson's foreign policy, especially on Vietnam. Fulbright became convinced that America's unilateralism was turning the country into an imperialist power. The televising of Fulbright's Senate hearings on Vietnam in 1966 helped catalyze public opinion against the war. "
31820,"Civil War Sheet Music  Civil War music usually fell into one of several categories: songs to rally the troops, spirituals sung by slaves, songs sung by families at home, and songs that reflected the homesickness many soldiers felt.

Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson, and Robert E. Lee.  Our Generals"
31842,"Born eastern Tennessee  In 1762, a three-man Cherokee delegation from the Tennessee frontier traveled to England as part of a wave of diplomacy missions by delegations of Mohawks, Cherokees, and Creeks. Thomas Jefferson, who witnessed Cherokee chief Ostenaco’s farewell oration on the eve of his departure, recalled, “His sounding voice, distinct articulation, animated action, and the solemn silence of his people . . . filled me with awe and veneration, altho’ I did not understand a word he uttered.” Soon after the chief arrived in London, Joshua Reynolds and other prominent British artists made his portrait.  This engraving, after Reynolds’s painted portrait, appeared in the July 1762 issue of the Royal Magazine. Scholars have questioned the degree of accuracy to which the portraits of Ostenaco reveal a true likeness. Ostenaco’s portrayal as “noble savage” contributed to a visual phenomenon that matched his spectacular image in written descriptions on both sides of the Atlantic."
31892,"Born Brooklyn, New York   In 1916 Jacob Gershvin, born of Russian Jewish immigrants, published, on Sophie Tucker’s recommendation,""When You Want ’Em, You Can’t Get ’Em—When You’ve Got ’Em, You Don’t Want ’Em,"" earning him five dollars. From such inauspicious beginnings came George Gershwin, one of the great American composers of the twentieth century. Initially drawn to stage musicals, Gershwin had several Broadway hits in the 1920s, most notably Lady Be Good with his brother Ira. His style evolved from hits like ""Swanee"" to sophisticated ballads like ""Someone to Watch Over Me"" and ""The Man I Love."" Gershwin experimented with placing jazz in a symphonic form with Rhapsody in Blue, opening to mixed reviews but thrilling audiences since its debut in 1924. His 1928 An American in Paris remains a classic. Porgy and Bess (1935), ""an American folk opera,"" broke new ground in musical and social terms. Gershwin’s music remains immensely popular, a major fixture of the American songbook."
31912,"Young artists like Pavel Tchelitchew were immediately drawn to Stein but warmed more slowly to Alice, who was less visible and forthcoming. But many came to appreciate Alice’s quick tongue, sense of humor, and housekeeping skills, especially her needlework and cooking. They wrote and spoke of their lingering memories of the two women at leisure, Toklas bent over her sewing and Stein over a book. Here, Toklas, with her conspicuously overstated bangs and flowery blue dress, bends over her handiwork.    "
31962,"As assistant to ambassador Averell Harriman in Moscow in 1946, George F. Kennan could closely observe Russian postwar diplomacy. For Kennan, Soviet policies of expansion had more to do with Russian history than with Communist ideology. To ensure that Washington saw the situation correctly, he sent an 8,000 word telegram to his superiors. Kennan's ""Long Telegram"" depicted Russian leaders who cynically dismissed international law and agreements when it suited them. He emphasized Russia's sense of insecurity and its desire for more territory, and stated that Moscow did not believe in a permanent peace with the U.S. Kennan argued that America must assume the role of a ""great power"" to balance the power of the Soviet Union. When efforts to reach agreements with Russia regarding Germany and Eastern Europe failed, Kennan's doctrine of ""containment"" became a cornerstone of American Cold War policy.  "
31969,"As a member of the Senate, Henry Clay had always stood ready to use his substantial influence to make peace whenever issues threatened to divide North and South. His efforts on those occasions had generally been successful. In 1850, however, as the quarrel between the two regions over the westward extension of slavery reached an impasse, Clay seemed too old and frail to stem the crisis. Nevertheless, on February 5, he walked haltingly into the Senate and for two days defended his compromise proposals for achieving sectional peace. Although his measures would not pass through Congress for several months, Clay had again succeeded in disarming the forces of disunion. "
32094,"Of the twenty-three occasions that President Lyndon Johnson made it to the cover of Time, the magazine’s April 12, 1968, edition was doubtless the most personally devastating. For this man who had practiced politics with unrivaled zest and skill, a voluntary exit from public life would have been unthinkable a year earlier. But in the face of virulent, divisive hostility to his management of the Vietnam War, Johnson decided that he had to retire for the good of the country. Doing so, however, did not come easily. In fact, when Johnson appeared on television on March 31, 1968, to make the double-barreled announcement that he was going to seek a negotiated peace in Vietnam and bow out of the current presidential race, even his wife, Lady Bird, was not sure that he could bring himself to say the latter.   Lyndon B. Johnson  1908–1973     De las veintitrés ocasiones en que el presidente Lyndon Johnson apareció en la portada de Time, la edición del 12 de abril de 1968 fue sin duda la más devastadora en lo personal. Un año antes, este hombre que se había dedicado a la política con entusiasmo y habilidad sin par no habría siquiera considerado un retiro de la vida pública. Pero la hostilidad virulenta y divisiva ante su manejo de la guerra de Vietnam hizo que Johnson decidiera retirarse por el bien del país. Esto, sin embargo, no fue fácil. De hecho, cuando se presentó por televisión el 31 de marzo de 1968 para anunciar que buscaría una paz negociada con Vietnam y se retiraría de la contienda para el próximo término presidencial, incluso su esposa, Lady Bird, dudó que pudiera pronunciar esa última frase.

32165,"This portrait shows William Clark stoutly respectable as the governor of the Missouri Territory, concerned with organizing the government, normalizing relations with Indian tribes, and settling the vast area of the trans-Mississippi West. But Clark had cut a far different figure when he first entered the territory in 1804 as the co-leader, with Meriwether Lewis, of the government expedition that bore their names. Then, Clark was only briefly removed from an army career spent fighting Indians in the border wars that followed the end of the American Revolution. Clark provided the expedition with much-needed practical savvy about the logistical and political obstacles it faced as it trekked northwest to the Continental Divide and then to the Pacific Ocean. The speed with which Clark went from scout to governor embodied the speed with which the United States explored and settled western lands."
32213,"No other industry in America was as dependent on poster advertising as the circus. The thousands of sheets of paper that appeared on every barn and fence in town shortly before the circus arrived were as much a part of the show as the parade and the performance. In bright colors and large sizes, circus posters easily dominated other forms of commercial advertising. This crowded poster by the Strobridge Lithography Company, renowned for its theater, show, and circus advertising, enticed the reader with multiple offerings. In addition to the delightful center illustration and promises of three circuses in rings, two menageries in tents, and seven monster shows, the poster lured viewers with portraits, printed in contrasting black and white, of the legendary proprietors, Phineas T. Barnum and James Bailey, and their partner at the time, James Hutchinson."
32327,"There is a heft or weight, almost an implacability, to Wallace Stevens’s poetry that sets him off from his contemporaries, especially his main modernist rivals, Robert Frost and William Carlos Williams. Unlike them, and almost singularly among American poets, Stevens avoided the inheritance of Walt Whitman, both thematically and stylistically. His consideration was never American democracy, and he was never interested in the jauntiness of a more vernacular or popular verse. Harkening back to Ralph Waldo Emerson, Stevens made himself into the one modern American poet concerned with the metaphysics of belief and the one American modernist who transcended his nation. While Williams famously proclaimed “no ideas but in things,” Stevens rejoined, “It is easier to believe in a thing created by the imagination.” Unlike Emerson, Stevens believed that you could replace God with poetry and its “supreme fiction,” hence the necessary gravity and heft of his poems; even his humor is weighty."
32353,"Following the death of Vladimir Lenin (Soviet Union leader and founder of the Russian Communist Party) in 1924, Joseph Stalin transformed his position as Communist Party general secretary to that of all powerful dictator of the Soviet Union. He relied on the terror of the secret police, the party's control over the economy, and the development of a cult of personality. (By 1933 he was called ""Father of the Soviet People."") In a sense, Stalin's actions during and after World War II were an outward projection of his all consuming need for security. He remained convinced that the Allies' delay in opening a second European front to fight Germany was a plot to bleed Russia dry. He felt that the country's only safety in a postwar world lay in a divided, weakened Germany and the establishment of a Soviet sphere of influence in Eastern Europe."
32388,"Soprano Leontyne Price trained at Juilliard and first scored a major success in 1952, appearing as Bess in a touring production of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. In 1955 she appeared in an NBC telecast of Tosca and was subsequently in high demand by opera houses in London, Vienna, and Milan. It was not until 1961 that she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera-as Leonora in Il Trovatore-and she quickly became a Met favorite until her farewell performance there in 1985. Especially associated with the work of Verdi and Samuel Barber, Price sang the title role in Cleopatra-which Barber created for her-at the opening of the Met's new home at Lincoln Center. Price was also a tireless performer on the recital circuit and won fifteen Grammys for her recordings. She received a Kennedy Center Honors award in 1980."
32400,"Born in the Waxhaw Settlement, South Carolina     In October 1840, the city of New Orleans hosted a Silver Jubilee for Andrew Jackson and his spectacular victory over the British on January 8, 1815. This contemporaneous portrait of the aging hero, white-haired and in poor health, was created by James Tooley Jr., a young Mississippi miniaturist. Tooley, who was already working in the city, obtained permission to make a copy from a larger oil portrait of Jackson created during the Jubilee. Tooley gave the portrait to his great-grandmother, and it descended in his family until its acquisition by the Portrait Gallery.   "
32434,"After launching his professional boxing career in 1934, Joe Louis made short work of a string of opponents who fell victim to his punishing knockout punch. On his way to winning the heavyweight title in 1937, the heavily favored Louis was staggered by his 1936 defeat at the hands of German boxer Max Schmeling. When the two fighters met in an historic rematch in 1938, the outcome was dramatically different. Buoyed by a tremendous outpouring of support from blacks and whites alike, the ""Brown Bomber"" KO'd the myth of Aryan supremacy by taking just 124 seconds to pummel Adolph Hitler's champion and retain the world heavyweight crown. A hero to millions for the rest of his life, Louis successfully defended his title for twelve years to become one of the longest-reigning champions in the history of heavyweight boxing."
32563,"The son of an American merchant and a Jamaican slave, John B. Russwurm, one of the first blacks to earn a college degree, graduated from Bowdoin College in 1826. The following year, he became co-editor of Freedom's Journal, the first black newspaper published in the United States. ""We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us,"" the editors proclaimed. ""Our vices and our degradation are ever arrayed against us, but our virtues are passed by unnoticed.""   Initially Russwurm opposed the project to colonize freed slaves in Africa, but in 1829, he announced he had become converted to the idea, and shortly emigrated to Monrovia as an agent of the American Colonization Society. In 1836 Russwurm became the first black governor of the Maryland area of Liberia.  "
32581,"The nomination of Dwight D. Eisenhower for president in 1952 convinced Republican Party insiders that they needed a vice president who was young, Western, and conservative. California Senator Richard Nixon appeared perfect. But Nixon soon came under fire when it was revealed that his supporters had contributed to a campaign ""slush fund."" With calls for Eisenhower to drop him from the ticket, Nixon made dramatic and novel use of television by explaining himself directly to the American people. Critics found him maudlin when he referred to his wife's ""respectable Republican cloth [not mink] coat,"" and added that while no money from the fund went for personal use, he would not return the little cocker spaniel, Checkers, given to his daughters. But the huge TV audience loved the ""Checkers speech,"" and Eisenhower greeted Nixon with, ""You're my boy."""
32595,"Two months after Amy Guest’s invitation, Earhart—together with Wilmer ""Bill"" Stultz, seen at left, and Louis ""Slim"" Gordon, at right—left Boston in Guest’s plane, Friendship. Their immediate destination was Newfoundland, the jumping-off point for their transatlantic voyage. On June 17, 1928, after a series of unsuccessful take-offs, they departed from Trepassy Harbor and immediately encountered miserable weather. Although they feared that they had gotten off course and might have to ditch the plane in the ocean, they reached Burry Port, Wales, after twenty hours of flying. They were almost completely out of fuel. Stultz served as the pilot and Gordon as the chief mechanic. Guest paid both men handsomely for their services. Earhart, in contrast, received no money. Furthermore, she never piloted the plane during the flight, which she readily acknowledged. Privately, though, it bothered her. As she later said, ""I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes."""
32617,"Of the individuals leading America’s civil rights movement, Roy Wilkins sometimes seemed comparatively subdued, especially as the protests over discrimination escalated into militancy in the 1960s. Yet Wilkins’s quiet manner and emphasis on working through courts and legislatures did not mean that his determination to win justice was less than that of his more vocal allies. As a long-term official of the NAACP and for many years its executive secretary, Wilkins was a chief architect of the strategy that in 1954 led to the Supreme Court’s order to end school segregation. In the decade following, he played a central role in lobbying Congress for the most sweeping civil rights legislation in U.S. history.  Henry Koerner’s portrait of Wilkins ran on the cover of Time for August 30, 1963—Wilkins’s sixty-second birthday and two days after the historic March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.  Roy Wilkins  1901–1981     Comparado con los demás líderes del movimiento pro derechos civiles en Estados Unidos, Roy Wilkins parecía más sobrio, sobre todo a medida que las protestas por la discriminación escalaron hacia la militancia en los años sesenta. Pero su actitud discreta y su énfasis en trabajar a través de los tribunales y la legislatura no significan que estuviese menos resuelto a lograr justicia que sus aliados más extrovertidos. Wilkins fue por muchos años oficial de la NAACP (Asociación Nacional para el Progreso de las Personas de Color) y también su director ejecutivo. Como tal, fue uno de los arquitectos de la estrategia que en 1954 llevó al Tribunal Supremo a ordenar el fin de la segregación en las escuelas. Durante la década siguiente, tuvo un papel clave en el cabildeo ante el Congreso para lograr la más extensa y radical legislación en pro de los derechos civiles en la historia de Estados Unidos.              El retrato que le hizo Henry Koerner apareció en la portada de Time el 30 de agosto de 1963, el día en que Wilkins cumplía 62 años y dos días después de efectuarse en Washington la histórica Marcha por el Trabajo y la Libertad.

32680,"On July 4, 1919, challenger Jack Dempsey met reigning champ Jess Willard in an eagerly awaited bout for the heavyweight championship of the world. Having demolished a series of opponents to earn a shot at the crown, Dempsey was a decided underdog in the matchup with Willard, who was five inches taller and fifty-eight pounds heavier than his opponent and considered unbeatable. Yet when the two boxers met before a capacity crowd, the contest was brief and brutal. In the opening round, Dempsey (in white trunks) unleashed a torrent of punishing blows that felled Willard seven times. By the end of round three, Willard was finished, and Dempsey was the new champion. He defended his title until 1926, when he lost to Gene Tunney.   More than twenty years after upsetting Willard, Dempsey commissioned James Montgomery Flagg to commemorate the historic heavyweight contest. Basing his composition on photographs taken during the fight, Flagg produced this mammoth painting in which the crouching Dempsey bobs and weaves his way to victory. Flagg also pictured a number of celebrities at ringside, including satirist Damon Runyon and cartoonist Rube Goldberg. On November 14, 1944, the painting was unveiled at Jack Dempsey's Broadway bar and restaurant, where it occupied a place of honor until the popular watering hole closed in 1974. Notably absent at the unveiling was Jess Willard, who wired Dempsey, saying, ""Sorry I can't be there. But I saw enough of you 25 years ago to last me a lifetime."""
32706,"Born Phoenix, Arizona    Senator Barry Goldwater's failed 1964 presidential campaign laid the groundwork for the subsequent triumph of Republican conservatism. Challenging the Republican establishment for its timidity, Goldwater provided a full-throated critique of New Deal and Great Society liberalism. Goldwater lost to Johnson in a landslide, in part because he was depicted as a dangerous extremist who threatened prosperity at home and peace abroad through his reactionary programs. Goldwater returned to the Senate, where he rose to the status of Washington ""wise man,"" helping usher Richard Nixon from office in 1974. He lived long enough to see his more aggressive, populist vision of the Republican Party, one based in the South and West, triumph under Ronald Reagan. "
32758,"Born Nevis, West Indies     Illegitimate and orphaned at an early age, Alexander Hamilton possessed drive and intelligence that attracted wealthy patrons who sent him to North America to study at King’s College (now Columbia University). An early advocate for independence from Britain, he enlisted in the army and came to the attention of George Washington, who made him a member of his military “family.”                   After independence, Hamilton supported a stronger national government, assisting in the ratification of the Constitution by authoring, with John Jay and James Madison, the most original contribution to American political thought, the Federalist Papers. Washington, impressed with Hamilton’s mastery of economics, made him the first secretary of treasury. Hamilton’s policies—assumption of state debts, encouragement of commerce and manufacturing, and promotion of a national bank—are credited with laying the groundwork for a strong republic. He was killed in a duel with the vice president, Aaron Burr."
32797,"The articulate voice of the Democratic Party during the 1950s, Adlai Stevenson initially held several diplomatic posts during the Roosevelt administration. In 1948, friends convinced him to run for governor of Illinois, a post he won handily. Four years later, he ran for president. With the exception of his liberal foreign policy views, Stevenson was a conservative Democrat, friendly with the party's establishment and hesitant in his support of civil rights and organized labor. He had the misfortune to run against America's most popular war hero, Dwight Eisenhower, and was soundly beaten twice. This photograph was taken in March 1962 at the United Nations Security Council, where Stevenson served as U.N. ambassador. In little more than six months, Stevenson would deliver his famous ultimatum that he was willing to wait until ""hell freezes over"" for the Soviet ambassador to explain that nation's placement of offensive missiles in Cuba. "
32822,"Born Allegheny City, Pennsylvania      The American impressionist Mary Cassatt spent her career in Europe, settling in Paris. Stifled by tradition, she regarded her exposure to the work of Edgar Degas in 1874 as a “turning point in my artistic life.” She later wrote that “Degas’s art is for the very few,” recognizing a critical sophistication required to appreciate his innovations. After her rejection by the Paris Salon of 1877, Cassatt welcomed Degas’s invitation to exhibit with the impressionists in 1879. Cassatt and Degas engaged in lively dialogues about the depiction of modern life, and their vibrant artistic exchange is evident in her willingness to model for him on several occasions. They also collected each other’s work. Degas captures the collaborative nature of their friendship in this portrait, where Cassatt is shown in what may be a photography studio holding photographs, possibly reproductions of works of art, seated, as if in the midst of conversation."
32836,"Geena Davis born 1957  Born Wareham, Massachusetts  Susan Sarandon born 1946   Born New York City  In June of 1991, this photograph appeared on a Time magazine cover with the heading ""Why Thelma & Louise Strikes A Nerve."" Opening in the summer of 1991, the movie Thelma & Louise caused quite a stir—feminists rejoiced at the sight of two strong female leads, while a few newspaper reviews panned the movie as ""degrading to men."" Just over twenty years old, the movie is still without equal for exploring not only the friendship of two women, but also the path they take to escape from their past lives. Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were nominated for Best Actress Oscars, and Callie Khouri won an Academy Award for best original screenplay. Davis and Sarandon continue to star in movies today and both are involved in many social and political causes. In 2007 Davis started the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, and in 1999 Sarandon was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador."
32852,"Born Waldorf, Duchy of Baden, Germany   An early herald of the American dream, John Jacob Astor arrived in the United States in 1783, a poor immigrant. He made his first fortune in the fur trade in the Great Lakes region, shipping the furs, particularly beaver, to Europe. In 1811 he sent two expeditions to Oregon and founded the first American settlement on the Pacific coast, Astoria. After the War of 1812 and the British departure from the Northwest Territory, Astor’s American Fur Company established a trading post on Mackinac Island, in present-day Michigan, which became the center of the booming fur trade. Astor increased his fortune in the China trade and in the accumulation of New York real estate, becoming in the 1830s the richest man in America. “It’s all a matter of habit,” he said, “and good habits in America make any man rich.” "
32888,"Born Savannah, Georgia   During a series of expeditions into the West in the 1840s, John C. Frémont created detailed maps and reports that opened this region to American expansion. He joined the U.S. Army Corps of Topographical Engineers in 1838 and several years later led his initial western expedition to map the territory through which the Oregon Trail would pass. Frémont became a national hero for identifying a route through the Rocky Mountains, but his reputation suffered in 1847 when he was dismissed from the army for disobeying an order. Elected as California’s first U.S. senator in 1849, Frémont was the Republican Party’s first presidential candidate in 1856."
32922,"Adolf Dehn's portrait of author Leo Stein, huddled close to the table with brow furrowed and fingers clenched, evokes the intensity of the physical act of creation. Brother of Gertrude Stein, Leo was also a distinguished writer and art critic. Like his sister, Stein spent much of his adult life abroad, particularly in Paris. While he supported the early modernism of Paul Cézanne and Henri Matisse, Stein broke with his sister over his distaste for cubism.  Dehn, a regular contributor of drawings to the avant-garde journal The Dial, knew Stein well. Here, he mimics Stein's strenuous activity with his own labor-intensive approach to drawing. Employing a rubbed-ink technique, Dehn made vigorous use of his fingers to soften lines and create shadows. The clever juxtaposition of technique and image is matched by the humorous omission of a chair for the seated figure. "
33015,"Born Port Huron, Michigan  Silent screen star Colleen Moore, featured in such films as The Perfect Flapper and Flaming Youth, set new fashions for liberated females of the 1920s, underscoring the impact of moving pictures. But when Batiste Madalena made this hand-painted poster for the film Lilac Time in 1928, the movie industry was experiencing rapid change and growth. The first “talkies,” synchronizing dialogue with moving images, predicted the end of the silent era, and the building of grand “movie palaces” reached a peak, luring new middle-class audiences to feature-length films. In the advertising image for Lilac Time, the artist featured crisp art deco lettering, geometric styling, diving airplanes, and Colleen Moore’s classic bobbed-hair flapper look, even though she plays a curly haired French country girl to Gary Cooper’s World War I aviator."
33061,"After purchasing his freedom from slavery, Olaudah Equiano became a well-known abolitionist in England. He commissioned this image for his autobiography, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano . . . (1789), published to ""excite . . . a sense of compassion of the miseries which the Slave-Trade has entailed."" This book, together with Phillis Wheatley's Poems on Various Subjects . . . , form the genesis of the black literary tradition. Equiano stares directly at the viewer in this portrait, demanding that we consider him a social equal, a provocative notion in the eighteenth century.  "
33094,"Born Ames, Iowa     In 1891, Billy Sunday, the star left-fielder for the Philadelphia Phillies, was offered a contract paying him considerably more money per month than an industrial worker would earn in a year. But he left the game—for considerably less money—to become an evangelist and Bible teacher for the YMCA. Converted four years previously and having heard the call, Sunday would go on to become one of America’s most popular evangelists. Although his career waned in the 1920s, he was still in demand, and he traveled and preached until his death, eventually reaching more than 100 million people. Ironically, Sunday’s gifts as a preacher eventually earned him more fame and money than baseball.   In this lithograph, George Bellows, the great realist of the early twentieth century, captures the fiery, spiritual intensity of Sunday’s oratory skills by emphasizing his forceful gesture—one that delights his audience and charges the whole scene with a celestial glow. "
33108,"As a nurse on New York's crowded Lower East Side, Margaret Sanger saw firsthand how constant childbearing contributed to the cycle of poverty, and in 1912 she gave up nursing to devote herself to the promotion of birth control. Faced with laws forbidding dissemination of contraceptive information, Sanger's crusade had much opposition. But by 1921, when Sanger founded the Birth Control League, her movement had begun to win adherents in respectable quarters. Many years of battling were left before birth control would become part of mainstream social thinking, but with Sanger leading the way, that outcome increasingly seemed to be all but inevitable.  This photograph was taken shortly after Sanger's thirty-day imprisonment in 1917 for opening her first birth control clinic. Shortly before her release, the police ordered her to submit to fingerprinting. When she refused, a prolonged physical struggle ensued, from which she emerged the winner. "
33146,"Colonel John S. Mosby was the commander of the Forty-third Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, more commonly known as Mosby’s Rangers. At its peak the command numbered about 400 troopers, but routinely it operated behind enemy lines in bands of 20 to 150 men, mostly at night. Raids were designed to destroy enemy supply trains, disrupt communication lines, and isolate federal troops from their base commands. Mosby’s “Confederacy” was centered in Loudoun and Fauquier counties, where most of the raiders lived. Armed principally with Colt revolvers, the rangers were so effective in their hit-and-run tactics in 1863–64 that the aura of fear they created was itself a weapon. This photograph of Mosby with a cadre of rangers is believed to have been taken in Baltimore, Maryland, after the war. "
33163,"Born near Easton, Maryland  Frederick Douglass’s skill as an orator, political savvy, and impressive bearing made him one of the most influential African Americans in the nineteenth century. During the 1840s and 1850s, the abolitionist rhetoric of this ex-slave who had escaped bondage best articulated the evils of slavery to white sympathizers and made the case for the need to fulfill the Constitution’s promise of equality. Douglass’s growing frustration following the Fugitive Slave Act, and his friendship with the radical John Brown, eventually led him to advocate resistance to the law and even violence, forcing him to flee the country briefly. Douglass returned to America with the coming of the Civil War, his hopes revived. "
33259,"  ""The human soul would be a hideous object if it were possible to lay it bare,"" artist Ralph Barton wrote in 1926. In his haunting self-portrait, Barton reveals what he usually took pains to conceal: the turmoil of the psyche. Inscribed ""with apologies to Greco and God,"" the picture suggests the artist's own mental anguish and the dark portraits of El Greco. Despite his personal charm and an unrivaled reputation for stylized images of the famous, Barton could not escape his manic depression and committed suicide before his fortieth birthday. But he had helped to invent a new type of stylish, lighthearted celebrity caricature. ""It is not the caricaturist's job to be penetrating,"" he noted. ""It is his job to put down the figure a man cuts before his fellows in his attempt to conceal the writhings of his soul."""
33277,"Only four feet, eleven inches tall and weighing just ninety-eight pounds, Bill Shoemaker was one of horse racing's smallest and lightest jockeys; he was also one of the most successful riders in the history of the sport. During a career than spanned four decades, Shoemaker tallied more than 40,000 starts and 8,833 winning rides, with repeat victories in the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness, and the Belmont Stakes. Just twenty-three when he won the derby crown in 1955, Shoemaker was fifty-four when he rode to his fourth and final derby victory in 1986. Unlike some jockeys who whipped and harried their mounts to the finish line, ""The Shoe"" was admired for his ability to guide his horses through his skillful use of the reins and bit. As a contemporary observed, ""If one needed the blueprint for the perfect jockey, [Shoemaker] would be it."""
33279,"Born Washington, D.C.    Writer and philosopher Jean Toomer was an influential voice in the African American cultural resurgence known as the Harlem Renaissance. Best known for Cane (1923), a novel of innovative modernist style that juxtaposed scenes in the urban North with observations about the rural South, Toomer was sensitive to the role that race played in American society. Yet he tried to look beyond race as a category that defined individuals. The grandson of the first U.S. governor of African American descent and the product of an interracial marriage, Toomer bristled at being described as a “Negro writer.” Having “seen the divisions, the separatisms and the antagonisms,” he believed optimistically that “a new man was arising in this country—not European, not African, not Asiatic—but American.”"
33454,"William Howard Taft would have much preferred it if his White House predecessor, Theodore Roosevelt, had appointed him to the Supreme Court. But Roosevelt had other plans for this man who had been one of his most trusted advisers. In November 1908, the good-natured Taft found himself elected to the presidency as Roosevelt's hand-picked successor.  In many respects, Taft's administration continued Roosevelt's progressive reforms that sought to monitor the nation's economic life. But many of Taft's old allies questioned the sincerity of his commitment and ultimately regarded him as a betrayer of the Roosevelt legacy. As a result, in Taft's bid for reelection in 1912, he faced a challenge not only from Democratic hopeful Woodrow Wilson but also from the third-party presidential candidacy of the very man who had put him in the White House, Theodore Roosevelt. In the three-way contest, Taft came in a distant third.  "
33464,"Pennsylvania attorney Wayne MacVeagh was one of a group of liberal or independent Republicans-derisively referred to as Mugwumps-who jumped to the Democratic Party to support reform candidates in the late nineteenth century. Passionately opposed to slavery, MacVeagh joined the Republican Party in 1856, and seven years later he was a member of the small group that accompanied Abraham Lincoln to the dedication of the Gettysburg Battlefield cemetery. In 1892 he shifted his allegiance to the Democrats, supporting Grover Cleveland, but William Jennings Bryan's candidacy drove him back to the GOP in 1896. There, MacVeagh  continued to support reform measures, including taxation on both earnings and estates in order to redistribute wealth and aid the poor. Throughout his career, he served in several diplomatic posts and also as the country's chief counsel in arbitration before the Hague Court."
33522,"Performing one night at Harlem's fabled Cotton Club in the early 1930s, singer, composer, and bandleader Cab Calloway was suddenly unable to remember the lyrics to his own song ""Minnie the Moocher."" To fill the void, he launched into improvisational scat, singing ""hi-de-hi, hi-de-ho."" His performance soon had the audience joining in, and his raucous finale, Calloway later recalled, ""nearly brought the roof down."" Forever after, ""hi-de-ho"" was an integral part of his identity as one of the Big Band era's most popular and respected figures.     Much of Calloway's success was owing to his own rakishly vibrant style, which injected his band's performances with a festive exuberance. He also had a remarkable gift for recruiting and holding on to good musicians, and among his band members were such jazz greats as Dizzy Gillespie, Milt Hinton, and Cozy Cole. "
33524,"Created at the Factory, Andy Warhol's studio, during an intense three-month collaboration, Jamie Wyeth's portrait of Andy Warhol is not flattering. Wyeth accentuates the older artist's blemishes and rumpled clothing, compressing his slim frame into the lower half of the composition. He used ""palette, brush, fingers, everything-and a lot of white paint""-evident in his subject's hair and skin tones. As the two worked side by side, Wyeth absorbed Warhol's idiosyncrasies, producing brutally honest images of him. Yet the representation is fitting for Warhol, who advocated flaunting one's physical flaws.  Warhol and Wyeth found their collaboration mutually satisfying. As Wyeth later recalled: ""I think he was fascinated by the way I paint because it's so alien to the way he works."" Warhol told one critic, ""I wasn't concerned about how he would paint me. I love his work."""
33538,"Hark! O'Er the Southern Hills    Penned by an anonymous ""Southern Lady,"" this poem captured the spirit of southern patriotism that was especially prevalent throughout the South during the first year of the war. This version of the poem, printed in Norfolk, Virginia, in January 1862, likened the South's fight for independence to that of the Revolutionary patriots under General George Washington, who is mentioned twice. Although the image of Confederate president Jefferson Davis adorns the top of the paper, neither Davis nor any other southern leader is mentioned by name in the poem. At this early stage in the war, the future icons of the Confederacy were just beginning to emerge."
33593,"Gilbert Stuart's full-length portrait of George Washington was sent to London in the fall of 1796, where its owner, the Marquis of Lansdowne, gave James Heath permission to engrave it. The English print was published soon after Washington's death in December 1799. Heath erroneously identified the painter as ""Gabriel"" Stuart, not Gilbert Stuart, and gave an incorrect date of 1797. Stuart learned about Heath's engraving when he saw examples for sale in a Philadelphia print shop. Angry at the loss of artistic control of the engraving-as well as of the income its sales would bring-Stuart complained without success to William Bingham, who had, he thought, promised to secure copyright for the image. Stuart also drafted a letter to Lord Lansdowne about the publication of the print ""without my privilege and participation,"" which was never sent. "
33602,"As captain of the CSS Alabama, Raphael Semmes excelled at implementing the South's naval strategy of destroying Yankee commerce. In the war's first three years, Semmes captured or sank more than eighty merchant vessels, representing six million dollars of trade. The Alabama was built in Liverpool, England, in 1862 but armed in the Azores so as to not violate England's neutrality. In January 1863, only four months after Semmes acquired the Alabama, it was already a serious problem for the Lincoln administration. Navy secretary Gideon Welles vented his frustration in his diary: ""Thus far the British pirate Alabama, sailing under rebel colors, has escaped capture. As a consequence there are marvelous accounts of her wonderful speed, and equally marvelous ones of the want of speed of our cruisers. . . . She will be a myth . . . till taken."""
33642,"Pocahontas, the Indian princess who allegedly saved the life of English colonist John Smith, survives and flourishes as an example of an early American heroine. While Smith may have embellished the story of his rescue, the importance of Pocahontas to relations between colonists and Native Americans is undisputed. Following her conversion to Christianity and marriage to Englishman John Rolfe, Pocahontas journeyed to England with her family to demonstrate the ability of new settlers and native tribes to coexist in the Virginia colony. While in England, Pocahontas sat for her portrait, which was later engraved. That print served as the basis for this later portrait. The painter included an inscription beneath his likeness, copied from the engraving, but through an error in transcription misidentifies her husband as Thomas, the name given to their son."
33647,"Born Multnomah, Oregon  Robert Diez was one of the renowned Tuskegee Airmen, the first group of African American fighter pilots to serve in the U.S. Army Air Force in World War II. He served with distinction in the war, shooting down two enemy planes in Italy.  Betsy Graves Reyneau was in Tuskegee, Alabama, to paint George Washington Carver and to create an image for a poster. Diez had studied art and asked Reyneau if he could watch her work. After she consulted with his commanding officer, Reyneau chose Diez as the subject for the poster, representing all of the Tuskegee Airmen."
33765,"The partisan ballyhoo of prints, cartoons, song sheets, and broadsides was particularly effective during the raucous electioneering of the 1840 presidential campaign. Promoters transformed William Henry Harrison, the college-educated Whig candidate, into a champion of the common man. When a critic sneered that Harrison, if given a pension and a barrel of hard cider, would be content to retire to his log cabin, Whig campaigners seized upon the imagery, enlivening mass rallies with free cider, new campaign songs, and log cabin pictures. The words to ""The National Whig Song"" helped inspire Harrison's supporters: ""Come to the fight; we'll win the field-away with doubts and fears; The People's man is HARRISON-let's give him three good cheers."" The lower and middle classes had suffered keenly after the Panic of 1837, and populist symbols, slogans, and tunes greatly helped Harrison's cause. "
33787,"With this group portrait, Gardner turned his attention to the medical corps of the Army of the Potomac, spotlighting the importance of Dr. Jonathan Letterman, who was named its medical director, with the rank of major, in June 1862. Letterman is credited with revolutionizing battlefield medicine, and his work as both a physician and manager was essential in bringing care of the wounded up to standard after the early battles exposed the army’s shocking unpreparedness to care for its casualties. Letterman systematized treatment, adopting the triage system for categorizing the severity of wounds. He also made sure that the doctors and medical staff were as close to the battlefield as possible, and he created mobile field hospitals. Letterman’s reforms made a great difference, but the medical staff was always fighting a losing battle against mass casualties on the battlefield and the prevalence of disease in camp."
33841,"In 1916 Marcus Garvey immigrated to Harlem, where he recruited working-class blacks and West Indian immigrants to his cause of racial pride and the liberation of the African continent. His Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) thrived during the nadir of American race relations. By the early 1920s Garvey, a skilled writer and powerful orator, had increased UNIA membership to 75,000 in thirty American cities, the West Indies, Latin America, and Africa. Although he could not sustain the UNIA, partly due to disorganization and malfeasance-for which he served a five-year jail term-Garvey can be credited with creating the first African American mass movement. His emphasis on black pride, separatism, and self-reliance influenced such later leaders as Malcolm X and Louis Farrakhan.  In 1924, Garvey hired James VanDerZee to photograph the activities of the UNIA; this inscribed photograph was one of the results.  "
33895,"Born New York City  Just sixteen when he broke into show business by playing ragtime piano in honky-tonks from Coney Island to Harlem, Jimmy Durante found his true calling as a comedian in the early 1920s when he teamed up with two other performers to create a comic cabaret act. With the irrepressible Durante taking the lead, the madcap trio quickly made its way to Broadway. By 1927 the group was playing to capacity crowds at vaudeville’s top venue, the Palace Theatre. Singled out by critics for his show-stealing antics in Florenz Ziegfeld’s Show Girl (1929), Durante launched his career as a solo performer in 1931 when he signed a five-year contract with MGM. Although the ""Schnozzola"" made twenty-nine films and returned often to Broadway, he achieved his greatest success on radio and television, where his self-effacing humor, mangled syntax, and hoarse-voiced renditions of songs like ""Inka Dinka Doo"" endeared him to millions. "
33921,"Dean Acheson was a primary architect of American Cold War policies originating in the 1940s. As Harry Truman's undersecretary-and later secretary-of state, he became convinced that Soviet actions in Iran, Turkey, and Greece revealed much grander ambitions for worldwide expansion. If not checked by the U.S., these actions would lead to Communist dominance in these areas and also among European nations that had not recovered from World War II. U.S. policies of military response to Soviet aggression and economic aid to Europe were largely Acheson's ideas but would become known as the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan. It was Acheson, as much as anyone, who persuaded Truman and congressional leaders to see the Cold War as a world struggle between tyranny and freedom.  "
33934,"John Marin's celebrated art concerned monumental forms and forces: bridges, skyscrapers, mountains, sea, and sky. But late in his career Marin discovered a new interest in the human scale of portraiture. An individualist inspired by modern art but not adhering to any movement, Marin used bold strokes, rich colors, and a cubist-influenced linear structure to explore both urban and rural worlds. Marin's well-known face was frequently photographed, painted, or sculpted by other artists. ""John Marin is an American original,"" one wrote. ""His face is incredibly wrinkled and puckers into all sorts of criss-cross lines."" In this self-portrait, the painter of rugged coastlines observed the effects of time and weather on his own visage. ""He was born old,"" critic Henry McBride wrote of Marin, ""and has remained young."""
33945,"Born Albany, New York     As a young girl Theodosia Burr had the unusual opportunity of a rigorous education. Her father—lawyer and eventual vice president Aaron Burr—insisted that she study Latin, Greek, English composition, and mathematics, as well as more traditional female accomplishments. At age ten, after the death of her mother, Theodosia became her father’s hostess. As mistress of Burr’s estate outside of New York City, she entertained such notables as Mohawk chief Joseph Brant and the future French king Louis-Philippe, as well as many American statesmen. She soon gained a reputation for her intelligence, education, and charm. After her 1801 marriage to wealthy South Carolina planter Joseph Alston, Theodosia’s life took a tragic turn. Suffering through illness and the death of her son, she herself was lost at sea traveling north to see her controversial father, to whom she remained steadfastly loyal."
33988,"This crudely carved portrayal of Benjamin Harrison is a memento from his 1888 presidential campaign. One noteworthy aspect of the contest was the quantity of funds raised to promote Harrison's candidacy. Built up largely through donations from eastern businessmen who supported Harrison's call for a high protective tariff, his presidential war chest contained in excess of three million dollars. By modern standards, that figure seems almost paltry, but in the late nineteenth century it was an extraordinary sum of money."
34011,"Louise Bryant is a figure remembered more for the people with whom she associated than for her own accomplishments. In mid-1914 she fell in love with radical journalist John Reed, and by year's end she was leaving her husband to live with Reed in New York's Greenwich Village. In the summer of 1917, she and Reed sailed for Europe to report on the Russian Revolution firsthand. Arriving in time to see the Marxian Bolsheviks triumph, both Bryant and Reed were convinced that they were witnessing the dawn of a new, socialized Eden. That bias did not prevent them, however, from becoming respected chroniclers of the Bolshevik takeover. While Reed's Ten Days that Shook the World was much praised for its accurate picture of the Revolution, Bryant's Six Red Months won plaudits for its portrayal of the human texture behind those events."
34164,"It is little wonder that Cleveland Browns star fullback Jim Brown was sometimes likened to Superman. During his pro football career (1957-65), Brown's strength, speed, and agility made him all but unstoppable as he powered his way over, around, or through his opponents' defenses. As one lineman noted ruefully, the only way to tackle Brown was ""to hold on and wait for help."" Brown's versatility also made him a constant threat. Besides exceeding the 1,000-yards-rushing mark for seven out of nine seasons and ultimately scoring more than 100 rushing touchdowns, Brown caught passes, returned kickoffs, and even threw the ball for an occasional touchdown. Although his NFL game, season, and career rushing records have now been surpassed, experts continue to rank Brown as one of the greatest ball carriers of all time."
34170,"Time’s cover story about poverty in America was about “a nation within a nation,” a portrayal of the country’s needy eking out an existence in the midst of unprecedented wealth and affluence. Time reported that more than twenty-nine million men, women, and children—“black, white, red, yellow and brown”—were living below the poverty line. This figure represented 15 percent of the U.S. population and seemingly gave validity to President Lyndon Johnson’s “War on Poverty” initiative, the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964. Much of this legislation, however, was dismantled in 1996 during the Clinton administration. Still, programs such as Head Start, Volunteers in Service to America, and the Job Corps have proven to be successful and continue today.   La pobreza en Estados Unidos  El artículo de portada de Time sobre la pobreza en Estados Unidos hablaba de “una nación dentro de otra nación”, relatando cómo los más pobres del país apenas lograban subsistir en medio de una época de riqueza y abundancia sin precedentes. Time reportó que más de veintinueve millones de hombres, mujeres y niños (“negros, blancos, rojos, amarillos y marrón”) vivían por debajo del nivel de pobreza. Esta cifra constituía el 15 por ciento de la población estadounidense y parecía validar la iniciativa “Guerra contra la pobreza” del presidente Lyndon Johnson, plasmada en la Ley de Oportunidades Económicas de 1964. No obstante, gran parte de esta ley fue desmantelada en 1996 durante la administración de Clinton. Aun así, programas como Head Start, Volunteers in Service to America y Job Corps ha probado ser exitosos y continúan hoy en día.

34328,"Born New York City  For years Julia Ward Howe yearned to take a more active part in public affairs. But her husband, the noted Boston reformer Samuel Gridley Howe, insisted that she confine herself to running their home. In 1861, however, she unwittingly transformed herself into a minor celebrity by writing the ""Battle Hymn of the Republic."" Composed during a visit to Washington, this fiercely martial poem, dedicated to the Union cause, was set to the music of ""John Brown's Body."" By 1865 it had become the North's unofficial wartime anthem.  After the Civil War, Howe finally broke the constraints imposed by her husband to become one of the best-loved figures in the growing women's suffrage movement. This portrait was begun in Howe's last years by her son-in-law, who attempted to portray her as she might have looked years earlier, writing the ""Battle Hymn."""
34351,"When Joe Papp originated the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1956, his intent was to cultivate an audience broader than the middle class mainstream who flooded Broadway theaters in the mid-1950s-to reach those ""who might never have seen a play before and who were unable or unwilling to pay."" By the 1960s, Papp had become a catalyst for alternative theater, most notably the 1967 ""American tribal love-rock musical"" Hair. The Shakespeare Festival  produced the phenomenally successful musical A Chorus Line at Papp's Public Theater in 1975, but his repertory also included jazz workshops, chamber music, puppet shows, and a wide range of classic and contemporary theater. His commitment to multicultural entertainment helped to change the face of American theater from the 1960s onward."
34404,"The movie industry, growing out of vaudeville and theatrical traditions that had always used poster advertising, adopted this medium as its primary form of promotion. Charlie Chaplin, one of the most versatile and talented figures of the early film industry, was a successful actor, writer, director, and producer. His screen image-the harassed but gallant Little Tramp who rarely lost his grip on his dignity, his derby, or his cane-had universal appeal. Chaplin's tragicomic persona disguised an astute businessman and a perfectionist filmmaker who is still respected for such classics as Modern Times (1936) and The Great Dictator (1940). By World War I, Chaplin had already gained international fame for the antics of his Tramp, as indicated in this poster by Danish artist Sven Brasch. Images such as this one transcended language barriers and kept audiences returning for the next Chaplin film."
34416,"Beaming at the audience of 4,000 teenagers jammed into the Paramount Theatre on October 12, 1944, singing phenomenon Frank Sinatra said, ""the crowd is swell, but I am always afraid of someone getting hurt."" One newspaper described the 25,000 who had lined up to get in as ""squealing, shoving-yes, even fainting-youngsters, mostly of the bobby socks persuasion."" The ""Columbus Day Riot"" marked the peak of Sinatra's early career, when his hits included ""I'll Never Smile Again,"" ""All or Nothing at All,"" and ""I'll Be Seeing You."" Signed by Harry James in 1939, he sang with the Tommy Dorsey band from 1940 to 1942 before going out on his own. Sinatra's appeal to bobby-soxers marked a sea change in the broadcast and recording industry, which had previously marketed pop music mainly for adults."
34443,"In the twentieth century, the doctrine of African American separatism ran a straight line from Marcus Garvey, through Malcolm X's activist parents, to their son. After his father died and his mother was committed to a mental hospital, Malcolm Little, as he was then known, became a criminal and was imprisoned in 1946. There, his exposure to Nation of Islam teachings led to his rehabilitation, and later to his ordination as Minister Malcolm X. His spellbinding oratory quickly gained him national attention as he declared all whites ""devils"" and urged blacks to form a separate state and win their freedom ""by any means necessary."" Malcolm X dismissed Martin Luther King's strategy of nonviolence as ineffectual, but in 1964 he broke off from the Nation of Islam, rejecting its racialist ideology after a pilgrimage to Mecca, in which he viewed Muslims of all colors worshipping together. He was assassinated on February 21, 1965."
34457,"When Jimmy Connors burst onto the pro tennis scene in 1972, he quickly shattered the game's time-honored decorum with brash, bad-boy behavior that led Time magazine to dub him ""The Hellion of Tennis."" But while Connors's court antics and temperamental outbursts proved offensive to many, his skills with a racket were undeniable. Combining quickness, power, and enormous competitive drive with a double-fisted backhand, devastating ground strokes, and a great service return, Connors became the dominant men's singles player of the mid-1970s. Only twenty-one when he won his first U.S. Open championship, he would capture a total of five U.S. Open singles titles between 1974 and 1983, along with two Wimbledon singles crowns. Ranked among the world's top-ten players for sixteen years (1973-88), Connors was still competitive at thirty-nine, when he made it to the semifinals of the 1991 U.S. Open."
34460,"Calder met caricaturist Aline Fruhauf at a birthday party for Russian pianist Alexander Glazunov. Many dignitaries of the classical music world attended, and Fruhauf was hired by Top Notes to document the scene. While Fruhauf was busy sketching, Calder was apparently observing Fruhauf. As Fruhauf's editor wrote,  A young man sat watching intently the flying fingers of our Funny Picture-Maker. . . . Suddenly, he reached in his pocket, brought out a pad of paper and a pencil, and began to caricature the cartoonist. He succeeded in making her look remarkably like Eddie Cantor, and yet recognizably like herself. Onlookers smothered giggles, but the object of his sketch only whispered, ""Sign it!"" and straightaway took possession of the paper."
34494,"With a voice like a sultry purr, entertainer Eartha Kitt has claimed countless fans, including Orson Welles, who called her ""the most exciting woman in the world."" Kitt debuted as a featured dancer and vocalist with Katherine Dunham's dance troupe in 1945, before embarking on an international career as a cabaret singer and actress. Her singing style and provocative stage persona made her a top nightclub attraction, and her early 1950s recordings of ""C'est Si Bon"" and ""Santa Baby"" remain popular standards. Kitt's career has included performances on Broadway, in films, and on television, where she scored a hit as the villainous Catwoman on Batman (1967). She is also remembered for voicing her opposition to the Vietnam War during a 1968 White House luncheon hosted by Lady Bird Johnson-a move that caused Kitt to be blacklisted professionally for some time."
34596,"With the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, no nineteenth-century president wielded his powers more aggressively than Andrew Jackson, which is confirmed by his use of the presidential veto over Congress. Unlike his predecessors, who invoked that power on strictly constitutional grounds, Jackson vetoed key congressional measures, not because he deemed them illegal, but simply because he did not like them. In doing so, he set a precedent that vastly enlarged the presidential role in congressional lawmaking.  Among Jackson's opponents, this executive activism drew charges of dictatorship. Those accusations, however, carried little weight among yeoman farmers and laborers, who doted on Jackson's professed opposition to elitism.  This portrait, showing Jackson in military uniform, recalls his early fame as the general who roundly defeated the British at New Orleans during the War of 1812. The painter of the picture, Ralph E. W. Earl, eventually attached himself to Jackson's household and spent much of his time filling the considerable demand for Jackson's likeness.  "
34635,"When the Emancipation Proclamation formally opened the door to African American service in the Union army, Martin R. Delany—a longtime activist in the struggle for black equality—worked energetically to recruit soldiers for black Union regiments. Troubled by the fact that these units were led by white officers, Delany approached President Lincoln in February 1865 with a proposal to create a fighting force under the command of black officers, whose ranks would be filled largely by emancipated slaves. After Lincoln approved the plan and Secretary of War Edwin Stanton endorsed it, Delany became the first black major to receive a field command when he was commissioned to lead the 104th Regiment of U.S. Colored Troops. He was ordered to Charleston, South Carolina, to establish a training camp and recruit black officers and foot soldiers, but the war ended before Delany or his troops saw action on the battlefield."
34641,"Born Fairview, Kentucky    Destined to become the Confederacy’s only president, Jefferson Davis entered politics in 1845 when Mississippians elected him to Congress. After relinquishing his seat to fight in the Mexican American War, Davis resumed his public career with service in the U.S. Senate (1847–51; 1857–61) and as Franklin Pierce’s secretary of war (1853–57). A champion of southern rights and an outspoken protector of slavery, he nonetheless wished to avoid the breakup of the Union. Davis supported attempts to forestall secession after Lincoln’s election, but abandoned the effort when Mississippi seceded. He reluctantly accepted the Confederate presidency, having hoped for a command in the rebel army instead."
34656,"When the Confederate government decided to build an ironclad, it resurrected the sunken USS Merrimack, cut it down to its berth deck, and added a sloped wooden and iron-plated roof twenty-eight inches thick. The finished product, rechristened the CSS Virginia, reminded some of a huge turtle and others of a steel coffin. Meanwhile, the Union had John Ericsson working on an ironclad vessel with a tabletop deck and a round center turret. His design was described as ""the image of nothing in heaven above, or the earth beneath, or the water under the earth.""  On March 9, 1862, these two vessels clashed at Hampton Roads, Virginia. The success of the Virginia in sinking part of the federal fleet and the arrival of the smaller Monitor, which saved the rest, demonstrated the vast superiority of iron over wood in ship construction.  "
34740,"On August 3, 1948, Time magazine editor Whittaker Chambers testified before the House Un American Activities Committee (HUAC) that he and Alger Hiss, formerly a high level State Department official, had been Communist agents. Hiss denied that he even knew the editor until Chambers supplied a young California congressman and HUAC member-Richard Nixon-with extensive details about Hiss. Chambers also revealed that Hiss had given him classified State Department documents, microfilmed copies of which were hidden in hollowed-out pumpkins on Chambers's Maryland farm. Hiss was tried for perjury (the statute of limitations had expired for treason) and, after one hung jury, was retried and convicted. Hiss maintained his innocence. The case retains a central role in debates about the extent of Communist activity in the U.S. in the 1940s and 1950s.  "
34923,"Born Chester County, Pennsylvania    One of the most powerful politicians of his generation, Thomas McKean was a multiple officeholder in both Delaware and Pennsylvania, serving in the latter state as chief justice for twenty-two years and as governor for three terms. ""The violent raging rebel McKean""—Delaware's enthusiastic signer of the Declaration of Independence-also served in the Continental Congress. He was its president when General George Washington marched to Yorktown and, a diligent attendee, was on hand from the first meeting in September 1774 until the preliminary articles of peace with England were signed in 1782.   It is said that as governor of Pennsylvania, McKean had no warmer supporter than Charles Willson Peale. Peale undertook several portraits of his long-time friend—one of them for his museum of ""Illustrious Personages"" who had distinguished themselves in the American Revolution—and portrayed members of the McKean family as well.　"
34991,"Born Whitingham, Vermont    Brigham Young converted to Mormonism in 1832 and gradually rose in the leadership structure until he became the head of the Twelve Apostles under Joseph Smith. After Smith’s murder by an anti-Mormon mob in 1844, Young assumed leadership of the larger portion of the church. In 1847 he led the Mormons from Nebraska to the Great Basin, where he founded Salt Lake City as the new church headquarters. He oversaw the migration of tens of thousands of Mormon converts to the West and the founding of hundreds of settlements. The Mormon majority elected Young as governor, but he was soon replaced by an appointed territorial governor. Political conflicts and challenges to the Mormons’ separatist communal and theocratic venture led the United States to dispatch troops to Utah in 1857 and assert federal authority. "
35020,"Born Prince Edward County, Virginia   A Virginian by birth, Sterling Price is remembered foremost for his service to the Confederacy in the West and his defense of his adopted state of Missouri. Price was a veteran of the Mexican American War and his popularity easily won him the Missouri governorship, serving from 1853 to 1857. In 1861, Price, initially opposed to secession, sided quickly with the Confederacy after Union forces seized the state militia’s Camp Jackson at St. Louis. Price served throughout the war, reaching the rank of major general, and saw action in Missouri, Mississippi, and Arkansas, including the battles of Wilson’s Creek, Iuka, and Pea Ridge, respectively. But a series of reverses in the western theater minimized his effectiveness and ultimately forced him and his depleted army into Texas. At war’s end, rather than surrender his broken army, he led what was left of it into Mexico."
35057,"Indicative of the cultural changes of the 1960s, Time’s film critic suggested that the “new cinema” was more than just telling stories chronologically; it was also about the technical and thematic freedom with which directors were experimenting. Bonnie and Clyde, directed by Arthur Penn and starring Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway, was the “sleeper” film for 1967. Beatty also produced the picture and used humor and horror to draw “the audience in sympathy toward its antiheroes,” both ordinary people—who robbed banks. The surprise ending, in which the law catches Bonnie and Clyde in a deathly barrage of gunfire—all dramatically filmed in slow motion—left audiences quietly subdued as they exited theaters.   Pop artist Robert Rauschenberg’s graphic cover art, in keeping with cinematic trends, juxtaposed Bonnie and Clyde’s blood-splattered getaway car with more glamorous images of their characters, based on real life.   El nuevo cine     Reflejo de los cambios culturales de los años sesenta, el “nuevo cine” estadounidense, indicaba el crítico de Time, era más que la mera narración cronológica de una historia; se trataba también de la libre experimentación técnica y temática por parte de los directores. Bonnie and Clyde, protagonizada por Warren Beatty y Faye Dunaway, fue el éxito inesperado de 1967. Beatty también dirigió la película, alternando elementos de humor y horror para “lograr que el público simpatizara con sus antihéroes”, ambos gente común y corriente que... robaba bancos. El sorpresivo final en que la policía atrapa a Bonnie y Clyde en medio de un mortal tiroteo, todo filmado teatralmente en cámara lenta, dejaba al público pasmado a la salida del cine.               El artista pop Robert Rauschenberg creó una portada impactante, afín con las tendencias cinematográficas del momento, donde yuxtapuso el ensangrentado automóvil en que escapaban Bonnie y Clyde con imágenes más glamorosas de estos personajes tomados de la vida real.

35156,"In 1955, with only seven years of seniority, Johnson was elected Senate majority leader. Through his successful courting of the ""old bulls"" of the ""southern caucus,"" particularly Richard Russell of Georgia-Johnson controlled the agenda of the Senate as no majority leader has before or since. Another element of his mastery was the ""Johnson treatment,"" as displayed here with Senator Theodore Green of Rhode Island. Newspaper columnist Mary McGrory described it as ""an incredible, potent mixture of persuasion, badgering, flattery, threats, reminders of past favors and future advantages""; Washington Post editor Ben Bradlee recalled feeling that ""a St. Bernard had licked your face for an hour, [and] had pawed you all over""; and Hubert Humphrey described it as a ""tidal wave."" Johnson's most notable victory as majority leader was the passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Act, the first such legislation since Reconstruction."
35167,"Born Hanoverton, Ohio     Thomas Corwin Mendenhall, a physicist and professor at Ohio State University, became president of Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 1894. This miniature of him was painted in 1918 by his former Ohio State pupil Annie Ware Sabine Siebert. Wallace Siebert, the artist’s brother, wrote of her talents: “You always seem to get the essence of a man, that which does not change with lapse of time.” A remarkable woman of her era, Siebert became the first recipient of a master of arts degree from Ohio State in 1886 and one of the first women to earn an architecture degree from MIT. "
35206,"Hopes for a short war had already waned months before President Lincoln’s new commander, General George B. McClellan, posed for this photograph. Shown with ten of his senior generals at Fortress Monroe, Virginia, in the spring of 1862, prior to the start of the Peninsula Campaign, McClellan stands beside and to the left of his predecessor, General Irvin McDowell. McClellan was called the “young Napoleon” for the self-confidence he exuded following his minor victories of the previous summer in western Virginia. Although a brilliant organizer of the Union army in northern Virginia, he was proving to be slow at engaging the enemy, and he would soon demonstrate a proclivity for retreating. In the fall of 1862, Lincoln would sack him for not pursuing General Robert E. Lee’s army after the Battle of Antietam. "
35274,"One of the great field geologists of his era, Ferdinand V. Hayden played a key role in the scientific exploration of the West. Although he trained for a medical career, Hayden became fascinated with the study of natural history while at Oberlin College. In the decade before the Civil War, he made several trips west to study the region's unique geology and to collect specimens. He did this work with the support of different sponsors, including the Smithsonian and the Corps of Topographical Engineers. The expeditions that earned him a national reputation occurred under the auspices of the Department of the Interior during a twelve-year period beginning in 1867. Hayden traveled widely but was especially well known for his work in Yellowstone. A prolific author who wrote for scholars and the general public alike, Hayden did much to encourage the founding of Yellowstone National Park in 1872."
35320,"Although he lived in the East, Theodore Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in the American West. After his first wife died during childbirth in 1884, the young New York assemblyman relocated to a ranch in western Dakota Territory, where he contemplated leaving politics for a career as a rancher and a writer. During this period he authored several books, including a biography of Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton and his four-volume epic, The Winning of the West. This interest in the American West continued during his presidency. Believing that America needed to utilize its natural resources more rationally, he made conservation a national issue. In a series of legislative acts, he laid the foundation for twentieth-century land-use policy. Native American history and culture also fascinated Roosevelt, and in 1907 he wrote the foreword to the first volume of Edward S. Curtis's photographic study, The North American Indian. Curtis created this portrait of the twenty-sixth president in 1904. "
35410,"By January 1953, when this portrait of Thornton Wilder appeared on the cover of Time, Wilder had won many distinctions as both a novelist and playwright. Best known for his innovations in drama, he had claimed three Pulitzer Prizes—one for his novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey and the other two for his plays Our Town and The Skin of Our Teeth. At this time he was in Europe, where he had gone intending to finish two new works. His gregarious nature and impulse to teach, however, were getting in the way, and he was instead spending most of his time lecturing on his craft to a succession of admiring European audiences."
35413,"Like George Gershwin before him, Leonard Bernstein exulted in the staccato rhythms of the city, especially the city--New York. His career flourished on a parallel course as a composer, pianist, and conductor: he was hailed as an overnight sensation in 1943 when he replaced an ailing Bruno Walter as conductor of the New York Philharmonic. Shortly afterward, he met choreographer Jerome Robbins, and they created the ballet Fancy Free (1944). Bernstein was intent on creating music with a fast-paced, authentic American voice, and-with his own heyday paralleling the golden age of the American musical-he captured the pulsing energy of the city in his most popular works-On the Town, Wonderful Town, and West Side Story. He also helped popularize music of all kinds in his legendary ""Young People's Concerts,"" which were broadcast on television to wide audiences in the 1950s."
35427,"In 1945 golfer Byron Nelson accomplished a feat that remains unequaled to this day. During that single season of professional play, he captured an astonishing eighteen tournament titles-a tally all the more remarkable because it included eleven consecutive victories. But Nelson's impact on his sport was not limited to rewriting the record books. Besides winning nearly every major title between 1937 and 1946, he is widely credited with developing the modern golf swing at a time when clubs with steel shafts were replacing the more flexible hickory-shafted models of an earlier era. By harnessing the strength of his lower body to power both his take-away and his downswing, Bryon unleashed prodigious drives that were breathtaking in their accuracy. After setting an enviable standard for others to follow, the golfer dubbed ""Lord Byron"" retired from professional play at the age of thirty-two."
35434,"Join the Conspiracy (Chicago Eight)  This poster was a call to arms for the “Days of Rage,” street demonstrations that the radical antiwar left organized in Chicago in October 1969; protesting the trial of the Chicago Eight was one of its goals. The Eight had been charged with conspiracy to incite the rioting that marked Chicago’s 1968 Democratic convention. The Chicago Eight were (clockwise from bottom) Jerry Rubin, Rennie Davis, Bobby Seale, John Froines, David Dellinger, Abbie Hoffman, Lee Weiner and (center) Tom Hayden. (Seale’s case was separated, making the Chicago Eight the Seven.) All were well-known members of groups that were adopting increasingly confrontational tactics. The trial lasted four months, and Judge Julius Hoffman lost control of proceedings early on, so that the trial became a theatrical protest in its own right. The defendants were found guilty only on lesser charges, and those verdicts were overturned on appeal. "
35449,"The individual who amasses great wealth, declared Pittsburgh steelmaker Andrew Carnegie in his 1889 essay ""Gospel of Wealth,"" must in the end apply his fortune for the benefit of all. Having built one of the world's largest fortunes, Carnegie took his mandate seriously. During his lifetime, he turned over a staggering $350 million, or nine-tenths of his total wealth, for benevolent purposes. Carnegie's unprecedented largesse was matched only by its social impact. His Teachers Pension Fund raised instructional standards in colleges; his many library endowments provided Americans with a national system of public libraries; and the Carnegie Corporation, established in 1911, became the prototype for the great philanthropic foundations of the modern day. During the last years of his life, Carnegie devoted his energies to world peace, encouraging the great powers to settle their conflicts through arbitration rather than war.  "
35465,"Suspense movie director Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980) ventured into the new arena of television in 1955 with Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Beginning with the trademark, ""Good Evening,"" Hitchcock would emerge from a silhouette cutout and introduce the episode. His mocking of sponsors and offbeat humor endeared him to audiences.  This 1957 TV Guide cover featuring a caricature by Al Hirschfeld (1903-2003) captures Hitchcock, down to the silhouette cutout. In the accompanying article, Hitchcock noted that he had been given ""more latitude in TV than I ever had in motion pictures."" Nevertheless, he continued to produce feature films during the show, including Vertigo (1958) and Psycho (1960).  "
35480,"James Cagney became famous during the Great Depression playing the prototypical movie gangster. His tightly coiled, sexually aggressive characters represented the dreams and energy of big-city America while often revealing something of the country’s dark side. Cagney’s characterizations were based on his own experiences growing up on the mean streets of New York City, having to use his fists in order to survive. He was urban but not urbane, a symbolic representative of the working class who sometimes made mistakes. According to Norman Mailer, ""Cagney was as tough as they come, and yet you always had the feeling this was a very decent guy"" because he showed us the humanity of his characters. On screen and off, Cagney was a rebel with integrity who projected speed, motion, and noise at the dawn of sound film. His ability to convey rough and charming hoodlums made thievery dangerously attractive."
35499,"Martin Luther King Jr. addresses a rally in Birmingham’s Sixteenth Street Baptist Church   Birmingham’s black churches served as vital community rallying points and training centers for nonviolent protest throughout the direct-action campaign known as ""Project C""—for confrontation. On May 2, 1963, from the city’s Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, King launched his controversial yet highly successful ""children’s crusade,"" in which protesters ranging in age from six to eighteen marched to demand their freedom. Televised scenes of those children being blasted by high-pressure fire hoses, menaced by police dogs, and loaded into paddy wagons did much to turn public opinion against Birmingham city officials. On May 10, King and his SCLC colleagues announced that a four-point settlement had been reached. It provided for desegregation of various facilities in all downtown stores within ninety days; adoption of nonracial hiring and promotion practices by those stores within sixty days; release of all imprisoned protestors; and establishment of permanent avenues of communication between white and black leaders."
35571,"In June 1776, as eight British warships stood poised to put a quick end to the rebellion in the South, William Moultrie, a planter with some experience as a militia captain, was in charge of the hastily built fort on Sullivan's Island in Charles Town harbor. The soft palmetto logs of the fort successfully absorbed bombardment from one hundred guns, whereas Moultrie's men discharged their twenty-five guns with a deliberation that demolished ship rigging and slaughtered enemy sailors. After eleven and a half hours, the British slipped away, giving South Carolina a three-year respite from war.   In the background of this portrait-showing Moultrie, risen to a general in the Continental army-can be glimpsed the famous fort, renamed in Moultrie's honor.  "
35582,"Dancer Isadora Duncan scorned the rigid rules of classical ballet and instead defined her art as an expression of natural instinct and inner feeling. Raised in a bohemian atmosphere that almost preordained her departures from convention, she began devising spontaneously choreographed works in the 1890s. By the early 1900s, she was touring in Europe, where her work won a considerable following. In the United States, however, many were scandalized by her minimal costumes, the sensual quality of her performances, and her numerous, well-publicized love affairs. Nevertheless, Duncan had her American defenders, including painter John Sloan, who observed, ""She dances a symbol of human happiness as it should be, free from unnatural trammels.""    Duncan was a favorite of modernist photographers, such as Steichen, who likened her struggle to free dance from traditional constraints to their efforts to win acceptance of photography as a fine-art medium."
35610,"Let fiction cease to lie about life; let it portray men and women as they are, wrote William Dean Howells in 1887, in celebrating the work of his close friend Mark Twain. A tireless writer who shared Twain's concern for social justice, Howells led an often-controversial campaign for realism in literature. In such novels as The Rise of Silas Lapham, which chronicled the progress of a self-made man among Boston's old social elite, he revealed his interest in ""common American lives."" As the editor of the prestigious Atlantic Monthly and later Harper's, Howells was not only the most widely read author in America, but he was also influential in promoting the careers of many emerging literary talents. Augustus Saint-Gaudens's likeness depicts Howells reading to his daughter Mildred.  "
35693,"In the early 1940s, the young jazz trumpet player Dizzy Gillespie began meeting with several other musicians, including Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker, at a New York City nightclub to explore a new form of musical expression. Out of these sessions came the infectious energy of bebop, with Gillespie as one of its pioneers and eventually its elder statesman. Aimed at evolving jazz out of its earlier swing mode, the new music initially offended some jazz traditionalists but ultimately found a niche in the popular-music mainstream. In the 1970s a critic proclaimed Gillespie ""the world's greatest trumpet [player] in or out of jazz."" His interest in African American culture is reflected in this portrait, where artist Marc Klionsky-following conversations with the musician about his heritage-flanked Gillespie with African masks."
35878,"Ex-Confederate soldier Lewis Powell (alias Lewis Payne/Paine) was one of the conspirators in John Wilkes Booth’s plot to incapacitate the government by assassinating Abraham Lincoln and other high-ranking officials. As the largely improvised plot evolved, Booth tasked Powell to kill Secretary of State William Seward. The night of April 14, as Booth went to Ford’s Theatre, Powell gained entry to Seward’s Washington home by saying he had medicine for the secretary, who had been injured in a carriage accident. Powell forced his way into Seward’s bedroom and stabbed him repeatedly, although not fatally. Rushing from the house, Powell discovered he had been abandoned by two other conspirators who were to help with his getaway. Powell returned to his residence at Mary Surratt’s boardinghouse, where he hid until his arrest on April 17. The trial began in May; Powell was sentenced to death and was hanged on July 7. Powell is seen here in manacles on the ironclad Saugus; the prisoners were held on ships for security reasons. "
35911,"Carte de visite portraits of Confederate generals    During the Civil War, the Union blockade of southern ports effectively halted the flow of most goods, including materials needed by Confederate photographers to continue their operations. Although some photographic supplies were smuggled through, by January 1862 it was reported in North that ""the Photographic Art down South has completely died out in consequence of the war."" Because southern cameramen had virtually ""nothing to work with,"" photographs representing Confederate leaders, such as these portraits of Generals Jubal A. Early, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and Fitzhugh Lee, typically circulated in the form of retouched copy images produced in the North by firms such as E.& H.T. Anthony rather than as original life portraits created in the South."
36048,"One of the earliest known photographs of Ulysses S. Grant, this tintype likely depicts him after his graduation from West Point Military Academy in 1843. Known for his distaste for military garb, Grant is atypically pictured clean-shaven and in stiff, ornamented military attire. Grant, who wished to end his military career after graduation, planned to become a mathematics professor and marry his sweetheart, Julia Dent. However, in 1844, as war with Mexico became inevitable, he was forced to relinquish his dream of a quiet, professorial life and postpone his marriage. Grant was anxious throughout the conflict to return home. This unaffected image portrays Grant simply as a young lieutenant, more concerned with the toils of love than of military and war.   Ulysses S. Grant     Una de las primeras fotografías conocidas de Ulysses S. Grant, este ferrotipo probablemente lo muestra después de su graduación de West Point Military Academy en 1843. Conocido por su rechazo a los atuendos militares, es raro observar a Grant recién afeitado y tieso en sus decorados atavíos militares. Grant, quien deseaba terminar su carrera militar después de la graduación, planeaba ser profesor de matemáticas y casarse con su novia, Julia Dent. Sin embargo, en 1844, cuando la guerra contra México se volvió inevitable, fue obligado a abandonar su sueño de una calma vida profesional y postergar su matrimonio. Durante todo el conflicto, Grant estaba ansioso por volver a su hogar. Esta imagen espontanea muestra a Grant como un joven teniente, más interesado por los problemas del amor que por los de los militares y la guerra.      Fotógrafo no identificado  Ferrotipo, c. 1847–51   National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution; donación del señor Ralph Connor y su señora"
36078,"Al Frueh's 1909 portrait of John Barrymore pictures the twenty-seven-year-old actor as Nat Duncan in The Fortune Hunter, the role that catapulted him to fame. Frueh saw a latent intensity in Barrymore's performance that the script hardly suggested. In addition to the heavy-browed profile that would soon become a Barrymore trademark, Frueh captured a clench-fisted, glowering desperation, evoking not only the matinee idol but the legendary Hamlet that Barrymore would eventually become.  After attending the theater, Frueh would sketch the full-length figure of a performer from memory, painstakingly eliminating lines and honing a quintessential likeness. When Alfred Stieglitz, an advocate of modern trends in photography and art, exhibited more than fifty of these portraits at his 291 Galleries, critics marveled at Frueh's economy of line. In 1922 Frueh translated the Barrymore and other portraits into a popular portfolio of linocuts."
36092,"Although largely forgotten now, Major General James Wilkinson committed more acts of treason than his former mentor, Benedict Arnold, ever did. Wilkinson shrewdly endeared himself to those in power, despite being considered an ""unprincipled imbecile"" by his contemporaries. Every president from Washington to Madison trusted him, and he was put in charge of the entire army. Unbeknownst to them, Wilkinson was a valued spy for the Spanish government. Wilkinson is also believed to have conspired with former vice president Aaron Burr in a plot to separate the western territories from the rest of the United States to create their own kingdom. When Burr was arrested, Wilkinson turned on his co-conspirator to save himself. Although Wilkinson was court-martialed, he was acquitted. In the end, charm could not save him from two failed invasions of Canada, and his military career ended in disgrace. Only after his death did his treason become known. "
36266,"Born and educated in Ireland, Anglican clergyman Berkeley was a religious and intellectual leader in Great Britain. ""Westward the course of empire takes its way,"" he prophesied in 1726, and two years later he departed for Britain's American colonies, settling in Newport, Rhode Island. He hoped eventually to establish a seminary on Bermuda. Accompanying Berkeley was the Scottish-born artist John Smibert, whom Berkeley had invited to serve as an art teacher at his new missionary college. Painted on the eve of their departure, Smibert's likeness represents Berkeley in his clerical robes, book in hand, pointing toward Bermuda, his desired destination. Despite his hopes, Berkeley did not receive the financial support necessary to realize this dream and returned to London in 1731. Smibert, however, stayed on in the American colonies, becoming one of the first professionally trained portraitists in the region.  "
36281,"During World War I, posters seemed to promise a fast, efficient medium for communicating with the home front, and painters, cartoonists, and illustrators volunteered their artistic talents as a patriotic gesture. California artist K. M. Bara's You Are Wanted by U.S. Army recruiting poster depicted General John J. Pershing, the renowned commander of the American Expeditionary Force. Because of two famous advertising campaigns-Uncle Sam's ""I Want You for the U.S. Army"" and Lord Kitchener's ""Your Country Needs You"" in England-the pointing or outstretched hand became a frequent motif for poster propaganda during the war. In addition to that exhorting gesture, Bara used bold coloring and a lively composition of crossing diagonals with the upward-charging horse and the twisting figure. For those who missed the reference to a famous equestrian portrait-Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David-Pershing's recognizable figure was authoritative all on its own."
36332,"The cool blonde star of Rear Window and High Society, Grace Kelly began acting on Broadway and in early television before pursuing a movie career in the early 1950s. She won a Best Actress Oscar in 1954 for The Country Girl, co-starring with Bing Crosby. In 1956 she retired from movies to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco in one of the most thoroughly covered news events of the 1950s. Princess Grace lived in Monaco until her death in an automobile accident-said to be at the spot on the Riviera where the picnic scene from the movie To Catch a Thief was filmed in 1954."
36369,"Born Hardin County, Kentucky     Lincoln was becoming a national celebrity during the summer of 1860, but some worried that his looks might cost him votes. Philadelphia supporter John M. Read hired John Henry Brown to make a good, small portrait that would serve as the basis for a printed campaign image. Brown had five sittings with the candidate but also based the image on several ambrotypes taken in Illinois. Lincoln’s secretary thought the result was “so well executed that when magnified to life size one cannot discover any defects of brush marks on it at all.” Mrs. Lincoln requested that Read give the portrait to her, and it descended in the family until 1975."
36417,"Charles Cotesworth Pinckney posed for his portrait around 1773 in the red coat (traces of which remain) of the Charles Town colonial militia. By 1775, despite formative years spent in England, Pinckney was an enthusiastic rebel. He asked artist Henry Benbridge to repaint the uniform, showing him as a captain in the second South Carolina regiment raised to go against the British. Pinckney, a friend remarked, had ""a passion for glory and Zeal for the cause of his country.""   Military glory eluded Pinckney-he was fated to participate in a string of defeats, never in victory-but seven years of faithful service won him the rank of brigadier general at the close of the war. Pinckney made his mark not as a soldier, but as a framer of the Constitution, an envoy to revolutionary France, and a Federalist presidential candidate."
36510,"In the mid-1890s, when publishers started commissioning posters from leading illustrators and artists instead of large lithographic printing firms, the artistic poster craze that had started in Paris was launched in America. Numerous commissions and exhibitions followed, enticing enthusiastic collectors and encouraging specialized dealers. So keen was the interest that there was even a demand for poster books, magazines, and calendars, such as this one by Edward Penfield. A deluxe edition for collectors, it includes four black-and-white lithographic proofs along with four color calendar pages. The cover, depicting the artist at work, uses the opposing diagonals of the figure and the cat to suggest the depth of his work space, while the areas of flat color add to the boldness of the design. Penfield's subtle humor is also evident: the cat, seemingly painted with those very inks it is eyeing so intently, appears ready to pounce on the uncorked bottles."
36537,"With his thrilling brand of ""go for broke"" play and his charismatic appeal, Arnold Palmer propelled professional golf to unprecedented heights of popularity in the 1960s. After capturing his first Masters trophy in 1958, Palmer went on to win three more Masters titles, a U.S. Open, and two British Opens over the next six years. Such a string of victories was impressive by any measure, but it was Palmer's amazing ability to surge from behind to overtake the leader in the final round of play that helped make him an overwhelming favorite with the public. At a time when televised coverage of the pro tour was in its infancy, Palmer succeeded in making golf an exciting spectator sport for home audiences as well as for the legions of fans known as ""Arnie's Army"" who turned out to follow their hero from tee to green."
36569,"With a voice that routinely brought audiences to their feet, soprano Leontyne Price was the first African American opera singer to achieve stardom at home and on the international stage. Following vocal studies at the Juilliard School, Price earned glowing reviews in 1952 for her performance as Bess in a popular revival of George Gershwin's Porgy and Bess. She followed this success by starring in NBC's 1955 production of Tosca, becoming the first black singer to appear in an opera telecast. Her career steadily gained momentum with acclaimed performances in opera venues from San Francisco to Milan. In 1961, when she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as Leonora in Verdi's Il Trovatore, Price received a thunderous, forty-two minute ovation. For years she remained one of the Met's brightest stars, as well as one of the opera world's most admired performers."
36570,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
36639,"A conservative painter trained in the academic style, Kenyon Cox was best known for the murals he created for such institutions as the Library of Congress and Bowdoin College. For some twenty-five years he was also one of the nation's leading art critics. In that capacity he argued against much of the innovative modernism found in early twentieth-century art. Cox liked the work of sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and published an article about its merits in 1887, the same year he painted a portrait of Saint-Gaudens. Two years later, Saint-Gaudens returned the compliment by executing this bas-relief of Cox.  "

36699,"Having first battled American soldiers in the 1860s, Sitting Bull gained a reputation as one of the most hostile warriors during the three-decade-long military conflict between the Lakota and the U.S. Army. On repeated occasions he led campaigns to rid the growing presence of Americans from traditional tribal lands. When, in 1874, officials tried to persuade a group of friendly chiefs to cede the Black Hills-where George A. Custer had recently discovered gold-Sitting Bull intervened to stop this transaction. Two years later his forces routed Custer's Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, an event that prompted U.S. officials to expand their military commitment in the West. Sitting Bull and a group of followers eluded U.S. authorities until 1881, when defections and a dwindling food supply compelled him to surrender. This photograph was taken not long afterwards, during his imprisonment at Fort Randall, in present-day South Dakota."
36873,"Commissioned by Cincinnatians to sculpt a bust of president-elect Abraham Lincoln, Thomas Dow Jones arrived in Springfield, Illinois, in the bitter cold of December 1860, promising his prospective sitter that he “was not to be assassinated through the custom of some sculptors in taking a cast of the face.” Jones was referring to a recent plaster face mask made of Lincoln that had hardened, making its removal a painful experience. Although initially turned down, Jones prevailed upon Lincoln to sit for him in a hotel room he rented as a studio. Given a peek at the work before its completion, Lincoln said, “I think it looks very much like the critter.” "
36905,"Perhaps the poverty he endured as an immigrant led Jacob Riis to his life's work as a reformer. In 1877 he joined the staff of the New York Tribune as a police reporter and was drawn to stories involving the disadvantaged. Massive immigration from southern and eastern Europe had a profound effect on American cities such as New York, where poverty and squalor were endemic. Like many reformers of this era, he viewed these immigrants-along with Asians and blacks-as inferior; nonetheless, he voiced his outrage over their misery in his masterpiece, How the Other Half Lives (1890). Setting the foundations for modern photojournalism, Riis used technical innovations to photograph the dark interiors of tenements. He formed a close friendship with Theodore Roosevelt, who, as police commissioner and later as governor of the state, worked with Riis to improve tenement conditions.  "
36975,"In 1947 Jackie Robinson transformed professional sports by breaking baseball's color barrier to become the first African American player in the major leagues. A trailblazer for equal opportunity, Robinson endured torrents of abuse in his first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Some of his own teammates mounted an abortive effort to have him dropped from the roster, while bigoted opponents and spectators alike taunted, heckled, and harassed him. Robinson steeled himself and responded with electrifying play that carried the Dodgers to a National League championship and earned him honors as Rookie of the Year. One of the top draws in baseball during ten memorable seasons with the Dodgers, Robinson paved the way for black major leaguers such as Willie Mays and Hank Aaron. After retiring from the game, he remained a staunch advocate for civil rights while building a successful business career."
37054,"Colonel Richard M. Johnson of Kentucky, touted as the supposed slayer of the Shawnee leader Tecumseh during the War of 1812, was the champion in Congress of ""ordinary people"" and foe of the ""moneyed elite."" His huge political appeal in the West won him the nomination as Martin Van Buren's running mate in 1836, but his common-law relationship with a slave, by whom he had daughters he sought to present into society (among other things), caused Virginia electors to bolt. Left without a majority in the Electoral College, Johnson became vice president by a vote in the Senate. Johnson is portrayed here in his earlier years, a man ""whose countenance beams with good will to all,"" noted Washington's social chronicler, Margaret Bayard Smith.  "
37329,"Born Beverly, Massachusetts  During a military career that spanned four decades, Henry Larcom Abbot earned acclaim as one of the U.S. Army’s foremost engineers. A West Point graduate (1854), Abbot participated in the survey for a Pacific railroad in 1856 and commanded the party tasked with mapping out the prospective route though California and Oregon. In 1861 he coauthored an influential treatise on river hydraulics and flood control following his extensive survey of the Mississippi River delta (1857–61). Cited multiple times for gallantry during the Civil War, Abbot was wounded at the first battle of Bull Run and later commanded the siege artillery at Petersburg and Richmond."
37456,"Born Uzlian, Russia  As a young wireless telegraph operator in 1915, David Sarnoff submitted an idea for a ""radio music box"" to the Marconi Corporation that would make radio a ""household utility,"" like a piano or phonograph. His idea was dismissed as ""folly"" at the time, but in 1926 Sarnoff achieved his dream by creating the National Broadcasting Company—the first network to have national broadcasts of music, news, and sports. His next giant step came at the 1939 World’s Fair, when he introduced television: ""Now we add sight to sound."" Television was a new art he envisioned as ""a torch of hope in a troubled world."" Sarnoff believed broadcasting had a ""gift for democratizing"" since people everywhere would have equal access to programming despite their economic status. NBC began its commercial television broadcasting in 1941 from WNBT in New York City, but the onset of World War II interrupted its development until 1945."
37503,"Sarah Josepha Buell Hale was a thirty-four-year-old New Hampshire housewife when her husband died suddenly, leaving her with five small children to support. Putting her literary propensity to use, she published poetry and a novel. In 1828 she was offered the editorship of the Boston-based Ladies' Magazine (the first American periodical planned exclusively for women) and in 1837 was installed as literary editor of Louis Godey's Lady's Book. Hale promised her readers ""literary excellence and artistic beauty, still keeping the moral tone onward and upward."" A strong advocate for increased educational opportunities for women (within the accepted female sphere), Hale proclaimed that woman in the nineteenth century stood ""side by side with man, a help-meet for him in all his pursuits and improvements.""  "
37547,"Orphaned at twelve and forced to work odd jobs to support his grandmother and two sisters, Ralph Bunche would not only achieve intellectual distinction-contributing reports to the classic work of African American sociology An American Dilemma-but would also become one of America's most trusted and prestigious diplomats. Bunche taught political science at Howard University, was an adviser to the State Department, and a strategist for the San Francisco Conference that founded the United Nations in 1945. Later, in his position with the UN Trusteeship Division, he negotiated an armistice in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, for which he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1950. In the 1960s Bunche lent his prestige to the civil rights movement, and in 1963 he received the Medal of Freedom from President Kennedy.     Time magazine commissioned this portrait  for a cover story in 1950, coinciding with Bunche's Nobel Prize, but it was bumped by another story and was never published."

Este dibujo del músico de jazz Ornette Coleman (nacido en 1930) es uno de por lo menos tres que hizo Elaine hacia 1965. Igual que en algunos de sus dibujos de John F.

37747,"Paul Robeson united great talent with commitment to justice in a career that won him recognition and respect throughout the world. Educated at Rutgers University-where he was class valedictorian and a two-time football All-American-and Columbia Law School, he sought greater opportunity than the legal profession then offered African Americans. In 1924 Robeson established his acting career with starring roles in Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones and All God's Chillun Got Wings. He also earned international acclaim later that decade for his concert performances of African American spirituals. For more than thirty years, he traveled throughout the United States and Europe appearing on stage, in film, and in concert. Speaking out against racial and economic injustice throughout his career, he often faced hostility as a consequence of his political views, especially in the years following World War II.    Robeson posed for this image while working on the film version of The Emperor Jones."

37840,"John Wesley Powell's work as an explorer, geologist, and anthropologist in the American West helped to shape national policies on a host of issues, including the status of native peoples and the development of public lands. Although he was celebrated for leading the first American exploring expedition through the Grand Canyon in 1869, his greater contribution came from his scientific reports on western lands and the peoples living there, many of which contradicted long-held beliefs. His advocacy of communal or government control of water for irrigation in the West was derided at the time, yet his studies served as the foundation for twentieth-century water-use policies. As director of both the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology, Powell saw science as a vital force in promoting the common good.  "
37861,"Previously either urban or rural, the post-World War II social geography of America changed with the growth of the suburbs. Suburbanization had many contributors-government loan programs, prefabricated construction methods, cheap gasoline, and the expansion of roads and highways-but its primary appeal was to the traditional dream of Americans to own their own home. William Levitt, from a home-building family, capitalized on these trends to build inexpensive homes on an assembly line, controlling everything from land purchase to loan or rental agreements. ""Levitt Towns"" became instant suburbs, especially on the East Coast, where they ""developed"" Long Island and filled in the spaces between New York and other cities. Criticized for creating monotonous tracts of ""ticky-tacky"" houses, Levitt replied that he fulfilled both a need and the dream of an improved living standard."
37882,"Born Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico  José Limón created a choreography that used natural gesture to express “human grandeur, dignity, and nobility.” In 1946 he founded the José Limón Dance Company, and this troupe became the first dance group sponsored by the U.S. State Department’s Cultural Diplomacy Exchange program during the Cold War.  Limón saw dancers as “part soldier, part gladiator, part matador.” The technique he developed “emphasizes the natural rhythms of fall and recovery” and a conscious use of breath to create a movement that “easily adapts to a range of choreographic styles.” Life is not embalmed, Limón once wrote: “Dance is a moment, and then it is finished.”"
37928,"On May 20, 1927, Charles Lindbergh took off from New York in his single-engine plane, The Spirit of St. Louis. He landed thirty-six hours later in Paris and was greeted by 100,000 wildly cheering Frenchmen. The shy Lindbergh brought letters of introduction to claim his prize for the first solo nonstop flight from New York to Paris. His instant fame in Europe grew into tumultuous celebrations in the United States, where millions cheered him, and he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. So began America's infatuation with ""Lucky Lindy."" Later, in the dark days before World War II, Lindbergh's admiration for German efficiency and industry, and his campaign against America's entry into the war, could not fully dim his luster. The ""lone eagle's"" battle with the elements and the machine struck a chord in America's psyche that still reverberates today.  "
37935,"An inset illustration in the upper left corner of this early map of Virginia depicts Powhatan, chief of the Algonquian confederacy that bore his name. In May 1607, when the first English settlers arrived to found Jamestown, Powhatan presided over a vast network of allied tribes. The many native villages figured on this map give an indication of how populous the Tidewater region was. Powhatan played a vital role in Jamestown's early development, contributing food, protection, and information to the English colonists. Yet in 1609, fearful of the settlement's growing power, Powhatan ordered Jamestown to be attacked. Sporadic warfare resulted in hundreds of casualties, and for a time England was forced to abandon its capital in North America. In 1614, after his daughter Pocahontas married colonist John Rolfe, Powhatan oversaw a period of peace that lasted until his death.  "
38158,"Remembering Martin Luther King, Memphis, Tennessee, April 8, 1968  On the day before Martin Luther King’s funeral in Atlanta, Coretta Scott King led a massive, peaceful march in Memphis that honored her husband’s memory by supporting the striking sanitation workers whose cause had drawn King to that city. Walking silently with her children and Ralph Abernathy at her side, Mrs. King was followed by thousands of marchers, carrying signs that read ""HONOR KING: END RACISM""; ""I AM A MAN""; and ""UNION JUSTICE NOW!"" At the conclusion of the march, a number of speakers addressed the crowd, including the Reverend Jesse Jackson, labor leader Walter Reuther, and antiwar activist Benjamin Spock, who declared, ""It’s not enough to mourn Martin Luther King. We must act to implement what Dr. King wanted."" The strike by sanitation workers that King had backed was settled on April 16, when Memphis city officials met the strikers’ demands for recognition of their union and guaranteed wage increases."

Seward lost the Republican nomination in 1860 to Abraham Lincoln, many people felt that it was a “sacrifice of commanding ability in favor of respectable mediocrity.” But Seward’s belief that the struggle between the slave and free states was “an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces” had made him some unforgiving enemies. In the end, Seward supported Lincoln actively and became his secretary of state. So closely was he associated with Lincoln’s policies that he was attacked on the night the president was assassinated, in an unsuccessful attempt to cripple the government."
38209,"William McKinley's ""front porch"" campaign for the White House in 1896 consisted mainly of speeches delivered to well-wishers flocking by train to his Canton, Ohio, home. As president, the main focus of his administration lay in responding to calls for aid in Cuba's struggle against Spanish rule. Although reluctant to meddle, McKinley felt obliged to act when the American battleship Maine blew up in Havana harbor, and interventionists blamed it on the Spanish. The result was the Spanish-American War, which led to Cuba's independence and Spain's surrender of the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States. Despite his own doubts about this turn of events, McKinley made the traditionally isolationist United States more visible in international politics.   One of several portraits derived from 1897-98 sittings at the White House, August Benziger's likeness testifies to McKinley's blandly funereal appearance. But housed in that uninteresting exterior was an unusual supply of warmth and charm that, as one observer put it, made McKinley ""a marvelous manager of men."""
38290,"On April 15, 1920, two gunmen took the payroll and killed the paymaster and guard of the Slater & Morrill shoe factory in South Braintree, Massachusetts. The police charged two Italian immigrants, Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, members of a violent anarchist organization, with the crime. The district attorney denounced the defendants not only as murderers, but as foreign anarchists and atheists; some believe he even intimidated witnesses and falsified evidence. When the pair were found guilty and sentenced to die, many attributed the verdict to the ""Red Scare,"" in which suspected radicals were arrested. Despite worldwide protests and eight motions for a new trial, both men were electrocuted. Historians disagree on whether these men were martyrs or were guilty.  A news photographer made this shot in the courtroom while the manacled pair awaited sentencing. "
38320,"Born West Hartford, Connecticut  A new nation required a new language. Or so thought the editor and writer Noah Webster, who devoted his lifetime to the idea of a specifically American language, one ""as independent in literature as in politics."" Webster began his project to create a unified national culture with his ""blue-backed spellers"" that standardized American spelling. He supplemented the speller with a grammar that relied not on abstract rules but on the observation of actual American usage. The work was an example of the pragmatism and rejection of traditional precedents that characterized American antebellum thinking in fields ranging from law to manufacturing. Webster's great task was the completion of his American Dictionary of the English Language (1828), a reference book whose title announces its intentions to create a lexicographic declaration of independence."
38321,"Born Gary, Indiana    In 1984, when Time magazine commissioned Andy Warhol to transform Michael Jackson into a pop celebrity icon for its cover portrait, the twenty-six-year-old entertainer had already reached an extraordinary level of fame. Jackson had rocketed to success, first with his brothers—the Jackson 5, whose first four singles topped the charts in 1970—and then through solo albums. His 1982 album Thriller won an unprecedented eight Grammy Awards; subsequent hits were commercial and critical successes throughout the world. As a singer, songwriter, dancer, and dynamic performer, he was unparalleled. ""Michael Jackson’s songs, steps, and sexy aura,"" Time claimed, ""set a flashy beat for the decade."" Although Jackson’s personal life and changing physical appearance over the years created controversy, his influence on performance and vocal styles as well as music videos, dance, and fashion endured until the singer’s 2009 death at the age of fifty."
38352,"Growing up in Harlem, boxer Sugar Ray Robinson gained a reputation for a style that was as ""sweet as sugar."" Along with his brilliant footwork, unrivalled hand speed, and superb defensive skills, he had a genius for grasping his opponent's style and adjusting to it. Robinson turned professional shortly before America's entry into World War II. During that conflict, he and Joe Louis traveled together presenting boxing exhibitions for the troops. Over a twenty-five year career, Robinson amassed one of the most impressive records in boxing history. Having won the world welterweight championship in 1946, he soon moved up to the middleweight division, and between 1951 and 1958 he captured that title five times. At the height of his career, Robinson won ninety-one consecutive matches, and in more than two hundred fights he was never physically knocked out. Muhammad Ali later called him ""the king, the master, my idol."""
38405,"Born Scott County, Iowa    William Cody did more than any single American to popularize the myth of the American West. Before achieving international fame as a showman, he worked a variety of short-term jobs, including serving as a Pony Express rider, an army scout, and a hunting guide. Nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" because of his prowess in hunting buffalo, Cody entered the world of entertainment after a dime novelist in New York wrote a story about his exploits in the West. A subsequent offer to appear on stage led first to a theatrical career and ultimately to the creation of his touring Wild West Show in 1882. For the next thirty years he was the centerpiece of this wildly popular display that combined rodeo, historical reenactment, and other western-themed performances. This photograph dates from the period when Cody first appeared in such plays as The Scouts of the Prairie."
38418,"Time magazine’s editors commissioned Roy Lichtenstein to create this cover portrait of Senator Robert Kennedy for its May 24, 1968, edition. It was issued in the midst of a turbulent presidential primary season when Kennedy was challenging President Lyndon Johnson for the Democratic Party’s nomination. Lichtenstein’s Pop Art style and bright colors create a sense of energy as it captures Kennedy’s image in the midst of a campaign speech. Kennedy responded in a bemused telegram: “I thought your cover picture was really marvelous, but I don’t have red spots all over my face.”  On June 5, 1968, just a few weeks after publication of the issue, Kennedy was assassinated while campaigning in Los Angeles. Time commissioned another cover from Lichtenstein to highlight the issue of gun control. A gun pointed at the viewer, though drawn in the same cartoon-like style as the Kennedy portrait, seemed haunting."
38442,"Union occupation of southern locales often made life difficult for residents, especially those who did not fly the American flag. Volck’s city of Baltimore was occupied early in the war—beginning in May 1861—and in this etching he depicts one of the hardships southern sympathizers endured. Northern troops would enter homes of secessionists in search of firearms and sewing machines; the latter were routinely destroyed to prevent their use for outfitting Confederate soldiers. Volck suggests that the intruding soldiers have dislodged the family from their beds; the mother comforts her frightened daughter while draping a curtain around their nightclothes. Soldiers keep the father from entering the room, while the officer in the foreground holds up a miniature Confederate flag, the only fruit in their search for arms."
38443,"Guerrilla bands like those in Missouri and Kansas were almost always composed of civilians who waged attacks, often in retribution, against enemy soldiers and the citizens who supported them. The South’s most notorious guerrilla leader was William C. Quantrill, who led a vengeful raid against the Union population of Lawrence, Kansas, in August 1863, the year this etching was made. Volck depicts here, amid a scene of destruction, a guerrilla’s attempt to recruit a new member, prying him away from his wife, child, and ruined dwelling."
38472,"When NBC tapped Johnny Carson to be the new host of The Tonight Show in 1962, no one could have predicted he would be America’s favorite nightcap for the next thirty years. And when Time ran its cover story on him in May 1967, he was already the king of late-night television, earning millions of dollars for himself and the network. Carson’s appeal was broad largely because everything he did seemed natural and effortless. “Johnny is the epitome of cool,” reported Time. “He is intelligent, laconic, deferential and facile.” Once when asked what his epitaph might be, Carson quipped a familiar on-air line: “I’ll be right back.”  Johnny Carson  1925–2005     Cuando NBC reclutó a Johnny Carson como nuevo anfitrión de The Tonight Show en 1962, nadie habría adivinado que sería el entretenimiento favorito de los americanos al final del día por los próximos treinta años. Pero cuando Time publicó su artículo de portada sobre él en mayo de 1967, ya era el rey de la programación nocturna y ganaba millones de dólares, para sí y para NBC. El amplio atractivo de Carson respondía en gran medida a su naturalidad en todo lo que decía. “Johnny es el epítome de la compostura”, dijo Time. “Es inteligente, lacónico, considerado y sencillo”. Una vez le preguntaron cómo sería su epitafio y respondió con una de sus típicas frases del programa: “Regresaré enseguida”.     Robert Berks (1922–2011)  Bronce, 1967  Portada de Time, 19 de mayo de 1967"
38494,"Archibald MacLeish always appeared torn between writing poems and the role that the poet might play in the public culture. That the attractions of public life ultimately won out was hardly a tragedy, but MacLeish’s writing has been devalued as a result. MacLeish won the Pulitzer Prize for his long poem Conquistador (1932), whose subject was the explorer Hernando Cortez. During the 1930s and after, MacLeish more and more became a public intellectual and a critic of contemporary life, arguing that modern customs had enervated and weakened the morals of modern society and contributed to the rise of totalitarianism.

38538,"Born Cambridge, Ohio  The third American in space, John Glenn was the first of the original group of astronauts (""The Mercury 7"") to orbit the earth, which he did in Friendship 7 on February 20, 1962; this photograph was taken at the parade celebrating that feat. Glenn came to NASA after a distinguished career in the Marine Corps. He was a fighter pilot during both World War II and Korea, and afterward he became a test pilot, making some of the first supersonic flights. Glenn left the space program soon after his orbital mission. After a career in business he entered politics, serving as a Democratic senator from his home state of Ohio from 1974 to 1995. In 1998, at age seventy-seven, he returned to space, flying on a mission of the shuttle Discovery."
38649,"Born Florida, Missouri     Before 1908, author Mark Twain sat for very few painted portraits. However, when Eulabee Dix wrote to ask him to lunch—and subsequently to pose for her—he gave her five one-hour sittings. Dix later wrote about Twain’s exuberant conversational topics, ranging from his daughter to techniques for washing his white hair. Twain also remembered his time with Dix fondly; this was the final portrait of him done from life. While usually depicted in his trademark white suit, here he also wears the scarlet and gray robes of a doctor of letters, an honorary degree that Oxford University conferred on him in 1907."
38698,"Born New York City  Theodore Roosevelt, born to a wealthy family, was a frail, asthmatic, nearsighted boy who read voraciously in natural history. By age fourteen he had mastered Darwin and become an accomplished field naturalist. At the urging of his father, whom Roosevelt idolized, he overcame his physical weaknesses, and by the time he graduated from Harvard in 1880, he excelled as a boxer, horseman, and marksman. Possessing the enormous energy that would characterize his presidency, Roosevelt had already co-authored an article on ornithology. By 1882 he had written his meticulous Naval War of 1812 and would become America’s most- published president. He married Alice Hathaway Lee four months after his college graduation. That same year he enrolled in Columbia Law School. In the fall of 1881 he was elected to the New York State Assembly, even there displaying a reputation as a reformer. "
38771,"Most would agree that anyone starting out in dance past the age of twenty is unlikely to go very far in the profession. One extraordinary exception was Martha Graham, who did not enroll in a dance class until she was twenty-two. Premising her approach to dance on the belief that movement grew out of emotion, Graham eventually went on to form her own dance company and continued to perform until she was seventy-five. Along the way, she also choreographed scores of original works and became a leading force in the creation of modern American dance.  This likeness was made when Graham and her company were performing in San Francisco. When some audiences members there found Graham's approach a bit too avant-garde the dancer noted, ""No artist is ahead of his time. He is his time; it is just the others are behind the time."""
39007,"As third lord of the manor of Morrisania (today the Bronx), Lewis Morris possessed thousands of acres of land worked, in the feudal tradition, by tenant farmers and slaves. His assets increased when he married Mary Walton, the daughter of a successful merchant, in 1749 (just about the time that John Wollaston, a trained English artist, arrived on the scene).   Morris entered into New York's rough-and-tumble provincial politics in 1768, and was one of the bold ones who pushed cautious New York toward rebellion. Chosen as a delegate to the Second Continental Congress, Morris was on duty as brigadier general in the Westchester Militia when the Declaration of Independence was adopted, but he returned to Philadelphia and signed the document in September."
39082,"In the dark days of December 1776, the password in George Washington’s army before the Battle of Trenton was, appropriately, ""victory or death."" The British had beaten Washington in New York and chased his troops into Pennsylvania. With army enlistment terms about to expire, a desperate Washington risked everything. His army crossed the ice-choked Delaware River on Christmas night and marched in the sleet and snow. High on an icy slope, where his soldiers could see him, Washington’s horse began to slip. In a brilliant equestrian feat, he grabbed the horse’s mane, pulling its head upright, and shifted his weight back in the saddle so that the animal regained its footing. When Washington’s army arrived at Trenton, the Hessians were surprised, not because they were sleeping off their Christmas celebration—as legend has it—but because they could not conceive of an attack in such weather. The victory enabled Washington to continue fighting. "
39097,"Lydia Henchman Hancock  1714–1777  Born Boston, Massachusetts  Thomas Hancock  1703–1764  Born Lexington, Massachusetts     John Singleton Copley painted these pillars of Boston society, aunt and uncle to the patriot John Hancock, near the beginning of his career. Copley trained himself in making paintings “in littel,” as oil-on-copper miniatures were then known; the more fashionable European technique of using watercolor on ivory was not yet well established in the colonies. Copley painted Thomas Hancock first, around 1758. After his death, Hancock’s widow had her portrait done in miniature by Copley. The artist then set his original miniature into a larger, oval piece of copper to match her portrait so that they could be displayed as framed pendants."
39329,"Born Winchester, New Hampshire    During the Spanish-American War, military officer Leonard Wood, together with his friend Theodore Roosevelt, founded the First Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, popularly known as the Rough Riders. Their success in Cuba propelled Roosevelt toward the White House and led Wood to be appointed the provisional governor of Cuba. Although Wood ruled with an iron fist, effectively disenfranchising the majority of Cuban citizens, he initiated a number of important projects, including a successful campaign to eradicate the deadly yellow fever epidemic. In 1902 he stepped down from his post, having presided over the adoption of a new constitution and the peaceful turnover of authority. He served a similar position in the Philippines before being selected army chief of staff in 1910. John Singer Sargent admired Wood and in 1903 sought out the opportunity to paint his portrait."
39330,"Born Peoria, Illinois    Betty Friedan's analysis of women's limited roles in American society, entitled The Feminine Mystique, was published in 1963. This controversial book galvanized the modern-day feminist movement and led to Friedan's co-founding the National Organization for Women. Her focus on family values and the role of partnership in marriage continued into the late 1990s as she encouraged the creation of a ""new paradigm . . . one based on today's economic and demographic realities.""    Artist Alice Matzkin arrived at Friedan's home in Washington, D.C., hoping to have one question answered: ""What makes life worthwhile?"" Seventy-two photographs and fifteen minutes later, Friedan had entered a reflective state that inspired Matzkin's rendering of the feminist matriarch.  "
39394,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
39415,"Wisconsin senator Joseph McCarthy’s sensational investigations into subversives in the U.S. government came to an end when he took on the army in 1954. McCarthy’s attack was instigated by his chief investigator, Roy Cohn (1927–1986), who was friends with a young army officer whose career he sought to advance. Cohn’s personal agenda and the lack of any actual evidence of subversion in the army caused the hearings to backfire spectacularly against McCarthy, who was censured by the Senate for misconduct, ending his meteoric political career. Cohn is shown here with Everett Dirksen (1896–1969), who supported McCarthy to the end despite his personal misgivings. Cohn subsequently had a long and controversial career as an attorney in New York."
39445,"President of the International Seamen's Union of America from 1908, Andrew Furuseth, a lifelong defender of seamen's rights, worked with Senator Robert M. La Follette to pass the Seamen's Act of 1915. Furuseth met Davidson in Paris in 1919 at the time of the Versailles peace conference, and ten years later he agreed to sit at Davidson's request. Davidson later wrote, ""He had the kind of head that told you, the moment you clapped eyes on him, what he was and what he did. Furuseth looked like the figurehead on a Norwegian ship, and he proved to be as fascinating as he looked."""
39551,"Spotted while on tour in New York City by moviemaker Mack Sennett, English vaudevillian Charlie Chaplin was signed to appear in Sennett's popular Keystone comedies in 1913. He quickly adapted the droopy trousers, derby hat, and cane-brandishing persona that made his ""Little Tramp"" a worldwide favorite in such classics as The Tramp, The Kid, The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great Dictator. In 1919 Chaplin joined Hollywood colleagues Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith in founding United Artists, a movie production studio owned and operated by the artists themselves rather than the moguls."
39556,"As a young man, Ulysses Grant was not interested in military life, but entered West Point in order to secure an education. In 1854 he resigned his army commission and tried several business ventures, all unsuccessful. Fortunately for the Union, Grant reenlisted at the start of the Civil War. Nothing much was expected of him, now a brigadier general, until he began winning victories in 1862, the first at Fort Donelson, Tennessee, where his terms were ""unconditional surrender."" Although some said he was not fit for high command because he was known to drink, President Lincoln promoted him to lieutenant general in 1864 and gave him command of all the Union armies.  After the war, Grant recommended a lenient policy of reconstruction, and in 1868 he was elected to the first of his two terms as president of the United States.  "
39557,"Horace Pippin took up painting in part to overcome the trauma he endured while serving in France during World War I. As a member of the all-black 369th Infantry, Pippin fought with valor, but sustained a gunshot wound that rendered useless his right shoulder and arm. Upon returning to the United States, he was unable to perform the manual labor that had supported him before the war. It was then that he turned to painting. Although his first works concerned the experience of trench warfare, he soon embraced other subjects, including his imaginings of African American life in the South and portraits of historic figures such as Abraham Lincoln and John Brown. By 1937 Pippin had begun to sell his paintings locally. Having caught the attention of several prominent collectors and curators, his work was later featured in various exhibitions and publications."
39633,"George Washington's presidency coincided with the advent of a real printmaking industry in the United States. With the demand booming for both illustration and popular prints for framing, engravers could now enjoy a steady market. Washington's growing status as a national icon after the Revolutionary War spurred the fledgling industry to supply the demand for inexpensive portraits. Various engravings show Washington as a military commander, a noble citizen-who, like the Roman Cincinnatus, gave up his power to return to his farm-a statesman, and a heroic symbol of his country. Readily accessible pictures-printed portraits, cartoons, broadsides, photographs, posters, and eventually film-have played a role in presidential politics ever since.    Interpreting the death of Washington    Americans responded to George Washington's death on December 14, 1799, with an outpouring of oratorical and pictorial tributes that encompassed various approaches to death, grief, and glorification. Enoch Gridley's engraving includes the traditional elements of fashionable neoclassical mourning art: portrait, urn, obelisk, and weeping figure of Columbia. Additional allegorical figures further exalt the ""father of his country,"" personifying, according to a published broadside, Fame, Wisdom, Liberty, and Truth. David Edwin's Apotheosis engraving implies a religious transformation as Washington ascends from his earthly home to be welcomed by heroes on high. The more secular deathbed scene, depicting Washington's physicians taking his pulse with the aid of a stopwatch, related to published accounts of his stoic final moments. Americans could buy the same image, along with a companion mourning picture, in the form of a printed handkerchief."
39804,"The next great poetic credo after Ezra Pound’s “make it new” was William Carlos Williams’s “no ideas but in things,” which occurs in his epic poem Paterson (1951). The line continues: “nothing but the blank faces of the houses / and cylindrical trees / bent, forked by preconception and accident.” Unlike Pound’s Cantos, with their omniscient narrator/composer, in Paterson Williams worked from the inside out, generalizing from a highly localized, closely observed community in his native New Jersey; Paterson for Williams is like Dublin for James Joyce. Williams was a pediatrician and family doctor, and his work may have provided him with the necessary emotional distance to be both empathetic and distant at the same time. In his poetry Williams wrote lines that blended “preconception and accident” to assemble a world that made a whole from fragments. "
39930,"While residing in Albany, Henry Meade served as a member of the Albany Burgesses Corps and posed in his uniform for this portrait. Established as a military company in 1833, the corps performed such ceremonial duties as marching in parades and serving as an escort for visiting dignitaries. Meade retained his membership in the company until April 1850, when the Meade Brothers relocated to New York City. "
39989,"Born Chester, Pennsylvania  Ethel Waters overcame bleak beginnings to emerge as a versatile singer and actress whose talent propelled her from honky-tonks to Hollywood. Beginning as a blues singer on the black vaudeville circuit while in her teens, Waters later made her way to Harlem, where she entertained at the Cotton Club and other nightspots. From the mid-1920s to the early 1930s, she appeared in all-black revues, including Blackbirds of 1930 and Rhapsody in Black, before moving to mainstream musicals with her performance in Irving Berlin’s As Thousands Cheer (1933). Waters became the first African American actress to play a dramatic lead on Broadway with her role in Mamba’s Daughters (1939), earning acclaim for what one critic hailed as her ""complete mastery of the art of acting."" She ultimately appeared in more than a dozen Broadway productions and nine films, including Cabin in the Sky (1943) and The Member of the Wedding (1952)."
40009,"Born Tengchow, China  Born in 1898 to missionary parents stationed in China and educated in both China and England, Henry R. Luce came to the United States at the age of fifteen to attend the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut. One of Luce’s Hotchkiss classmates and closest associates was Britton Haden, who graduated from Yale with Luce and later worked with him on the Baltimore News. Both quit their newspaper jobs in order to raise enough capital to publish a new magazine, Time, the first issue of which appeared on March 3, 1923. The great popularity of their first magazine led to the publication of the second, Fortune, in February 1930. Haden died in 1929, but Luce continued as editor of the publication venture and achieved the astounding feat of producing a successful business publication in the midst of the stock market crash and the depression that followed. In 1936 he established the Henry Luce Foundation for philanthropy. "
40064,"The younger of the Meade Brothers, Charles was just sixteen and working as a clerk in a dry goods store when he and his brother started their daguerreian gallery. Despite his youth, Charles played an important role in the Meade Brothers’ partnership from its earliest days. He represented the firm ably on several trips abroad and scored a major coup in 1848 by daguerreotyping Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre. In 1853 he produced the daguerreotypes known as the Seven Ages of Man, which were featured in several major exhibitions. Charles was leading the brothers’ effort to transition to paper-print photography when he died at age thirty-one."
40120,"As the general who led us to victory in the American Revolution and as our first president, George Washington was often painted and sculpted. Everyone, it seemed, wanted the hero's portrait. But it is this portrait that stands for all time as the image that best represents what Washington meant to us when we were a new nation and continues to mean to us in the twenty-first century. It is the one picture that we can say ranks in importance with those sacred founding documents, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   We see Washington in 1796, the last year of his two-term presidency. Earlier full-length portraits show him in military uniform, but here he is in civilian dress, revealing that in our democracy the elected executive is the true commander-in-chief. Standing in elegant surroundings suggesting the grandeur of European tradition, Washington is nonetheless not draped like a king, which he refused to be; he is a man powerful only by the people's consent. This was the man who told us what this new kind of leader-an elected president-could be and whose maturity and resolve gave us confidence in our future. The rainbow behind him breaks through a stormy sky.   Washington was lucky in his portraitist, and so are we. American-born Gilbert Stuart had eighteen years in Europe to hone his artistry. He was commissioned by Senator and Mrs. William Bingham of Pennsylvania to provide a gift to the Marquis of Lansdowne, an English supporter of American independence. It was copied by Stuart and others as THE image of Washington who sustains our national purpose-the Washington every generation of Americans needs to rediscover.Gilbert Stuart (1755-1828)"

The National Portrait Gallery’s full-length 1796 “Lansdowne” portrait of George Washington by Gilbert Stuart will be off view until late fall of 2017 for conservation. The painting has been conserved in the past and is in stable condition; however, a yellowed varnish currently disguises the portrait’s original brilliance. Conservators will clean the Lansdowne, and for the first time since the museum acquired it, the painting will undergo a complete analysis using digital X-rays, infrared reflectography, and ultraviolet light.      The painting’s conservation is being funded by Bank of America.     The Lansdowne has been on view in the museum since it opened in 1968, on long-term loan before the Portrait Gallery acquired the portrait in 2001 through the generosity of the Donald W.

40140,"This photograph shows Earhart’s arrival in New York City on June 20, 1932. Thousands waited to see her. Mayor James Walker greeted her with a large bouquet of red roses and rode with her up Broadway amid confetti and tickertape to City Hall. There, after several speeches, she was presented with a gold medal. Ever modest in public, she described the reception as ""overwhelming. It’s much too much for my exploit."" Asked by reporters about the significance of her flight, she explained, ""I hope you understand that my flight added nothing to aviation. It was just a personal gesture on my part. . . . Of course, if it means something to women in aviation, that’s fine."" In the months that followed, Earhart continued to be honored: Congress awarded her the Distinguished Flying Cross and President Herbert Hoover honored her with the Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society."
40141,"Frank Hawks (1897–1938) took Amelia Earhart on her first airplane ride in 1921. An ex-Army officer, he worked at an airstrip in Los Angeles, where he gave flying lessons and performed stunts in local air shows. Although the flight excited her, she didn’t feel comfortable taking lessons with Hawks. Instead, she approached Neta Snook, the only female flight instructor in California. Snook was only a year older than Earhart but had graduated from the well-regarded Curtiss School of Aviation in Newport News, Virginia. Hawks went on to achieve multiple aviation records in a prestigious flying career, although he died in a plane crash in 1938.  This photograph was taken in 1930 at a New Jersey air show where Hawks was performing."
40288,"Born Rockland, Maine  Literarily and temperamentally precocious, the poet Edna St. Vincent Millay exemplified the spirit of the ""Roaring Twenties"" and the emancipation of American women. She started writing as a child and became a rebellious student at Vassar College. In 1917 she moved to Greenwich Village, the center of avant-garde and rebel culture. She won the Pulitzer Prize for The Harp-Weaver in 1923. Poetically, Millay was a romantic, inspired by the ecstatic visions of John Keats and William Wordsworth; her first notable poem ""Renascence"" (1912) spoke of a nature that ""breathed my soul back into me."" Her famous quatrain ""First Fig"" (1920) celebrates abandonment:   My candle burns at both ends;  It will not last the night;  But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends—  It gives a lovely light.  Millay’s romanticism was at odds with literary modernism, and her reputation has declined. However, during the 1920s she exemplified the age that she did so much to define."
40318,"Placed at the head of Ulysses S. Grant's cavalry in 1864, General Philip H. Sheridan faced his greatest challenge on October 19 in the Shenandoah Valley. Informed that his troops were being overrun at the Battle of Cedar Creek, he leapt on his horse and galloped some twenty miles at breakneck speed to rally them. He arrived on the field in two hours and turned an almost certain defeat into a victory.  News of this event excited the imaginations of northerners. President Lincoln was pleased because he could not afford any setbacks on the battlefield with the presidential election only weeks away. Artist Thomas Buchanan Read visited Sheridan's camp to make preliminary sketches for a painting of the general's legendary ride. After the war, Read completed several versions of the work, including this one, which Grant's family owned for many years.  "
40498,"Born Salisbury, New Hampshire    In a period when American federalism faced increasing challenges from states'-rights supporters, Daniel Webster emerged as one of the Union's most eloquent defenders. Having gained acclaim as a lawyer who argued some of the young republic's pivotal Supreme Court cases, Webster became a major force in national politics through his service in the House and the Senate. There, his brilliant orations on behalf of the indivisibility of the Union marked him as one of the greatest public figures of his generation. Southworth & Hawes daguerreotyped Webster on numerous occasions. This portrait is a vintage copy of an original plate whose whereabouts is unknown."
40516,"The manor house at Bilignin was picture-book France, old and full of character. Its living room walls were paneled and decorated with paintings of musical instruments; tall windows with outside shutters opened up to the terrace garden. When the English artists Cecil Beaton and Francis Rose came for a visit in the summer of 1939, they were so taken by the beauty of this room and its four occupants—Stein, Toklas, and the two dogs, Basket and Pépé—that they both made images of it. Beaton’s photograph shows Stein at her writing desk, and Rose’s drawing offers a genre scene of marital harmony: Toklas knitting in a wicker chair and Stein reading in her favorite rocker. "
40521,"On June 20, 1923, President Warren Harding, troubled by revelations of corruption among some of his trusted cabinet members, left Washington for a planned cruise to Alaska. Returning to Seattle at the end of July, he collapsed while delivering a speech. First diagnosed as food poisoning, his illness is now believed to be a heart attack, followed shortly by bronchial pneumonia and a cerebral hemorrhage, which killed him on August 2."
40565,"Born Milton, Massachusetts    Although not an accredited architect, Buckminster Fuller was best known for his many experiments in building design and his philosophy of architecture. Adhering to his ""dymaxion"" principle, which called for maximum results from a minimum of material and energy, he was an early advocate of prefabrication and modular construction. The most famous of Fuller's achievements was the geodesic dome, which artist Boris Artzybasheff wittily depicts here as the structure of Fuller's face and skull. Patented in 1947, this spherical structure required no internal support, thus creating an unobstructed interior space. In 1967, one of Fuller's domes served as the United States pavilion at the world exposition in Montreal, where it became a symbol of America's tradition in technical innovation.   "
40567,"Boxing great Muhammad Ali became a news sensation a year before he ever won his first world heavyweight title in 1964, beating Sonny Liston in six rounds with a technical knockout. Ali, a convert to the Nation of Islam, dropped his birth name, Cassius M. Clay Jr., after this match. In a boxing career that would span two decades, Ali compiled a 56–5 win-loss record, and many considered him the greatest heavyweight champion ever. His colorful, jaunty personality had much to do with his stellar media attraction. And his lyrical prefight taunts and predictions—""if he gives me some jive, I’ll end it in five""—kept boxing fans and nonfans alike engaged and smiling. "
40578,"Considered the mother of modern dance in America, Martha Graham brought dance into the vortex of the machine age: the idea of motion was a fundamental tenet of modernism, and Graham was determined to extract dance from its balletic-and European-classicism and infuse it with ""significant movement, . . . with excitement and surge."" She studied at Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn's Denishawn School from 1916 to 1923 and then worked at the Greenwich Village Follies, where she began to design and choreograph her own dances. By 1935 she had established the Martha Graham School for Contemporary Dance, and its first performance, ""Frontier,"" reflected her notion that ""life today is nervous, sharp and zigzag."" Graham continued to perform until she was seventy-six and created new ballets until her death."
40591,"The son of a farmer and tavernkeeper, Martin Van Buren was too poor to attend college. Yet he studied law, became a prosperous lawyer, and was an influential founder of the Democratic Party in the 1820s. An early party organizer in his home state of New York, Van Buren helped establish a tradition of grassroots politicking that continues today. Along the way, Van Buren acquired the refined tastes of a country gentleman. This 1840 caricature portrays him as a dandy and mocks his presidential reelection bid, in which he was running against William Henry Harrison, the Whig Party's winning candidate."
40595,"Washington Irving, having written many successful mock histories of New York and short stories, including ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Rip Van Winkle,"" set off for Europe in 1826 in search of literary inspiration. At the invitation of Alexander H. Everett, the minister to Spain, Irving attached himself to the American legation in Madrid. The author fell in love with the country and wrote four of his best-known books there, including Columbus (1828) and The Companions of Columbus (1831). Irving became fascinated with the exoticism of Moorish culture in southern Spain, and The Conquest of Granada (1829) and Tales of the Alhambra (1832) became among the most successful of the romanticized histories of that region in print. Irving created such colorful curiosities that Anglo-Saxon tourists began to travel there with his books as guides. In 1842 Irving was appointed minister to Spain and served with distinction until 1848.    Tras escribir con éxito historias apócrifas sobre Nueva York y cuentos como ""La leyenda de Sleepy Hollow"" y ""Rip Van Winkle"", Washington Irving salió para Europa en 1826 en busca de inspiración literaria. Invitado por Alexander H. Everett, ministro representante de los Estados Unidos en España, Irving se unió a la legación norteamericana en Madrid. El autor se enamoró del país y escribió cuatro de sus libros más conocidos, incluidos Colón (1828) y Los compañeros de Colón (1831). Irving quedó fascinado por el exotismo de la cultura árabe del sur de España, y La conquista de Granada (1829) y Cuentos de la Alhambra (1832) se convirtieron en unas de las colecciones más populares de historias idealizadas que se publicaron sobre esa región. Irving dio noticias tan pintorescas que los turistas anglosajones empezaron a viajar a Andalucía usando sus libros como guías. En 1842 nombraron a Irving embajador de los Estados Unidos en España, donde sirvió con distinción hasta 1848."
40647,"Grant’s postwar career and the history of his two terms as president are outside the scope of this exhibition; Grant’s presidency is generally judged as unsuccessful and blighted by corruption. However, the last period of his life has had a lasting imprint on his reputation and on the history of the war. Grant lost almost all of his wealth in a financial panic in 1884, and to make money he started writing about the war. Writer Samuel Clemens negotiated an advantageous contract for him. Diagnosed with throat cancer, Grant raced the clock to finish the book, dying just after completing it. He is shown here near the end. A huge best-seller, Grant’s Memoirs benefited his family, and the book is one of the great works of American literature: the clarity of the crisp, clean prose anticipates modern American writing. It is also an invaluable history of the war that Grant waged so relentlessly.   Ulysses S. Grant     La carrera, posterior a la guerra, de Grant y la historia de sus dos mandatos como presidente están fuera del alcance de esta exposición. Generalmente, la presidencia de Grant se considera ineficaz y dañada por la corrupción. Sin embargo, el último período de su vida ha tenido una profunda huella en su reputación y en la historia de la guerra. Grant perdió casi toda su riqueza en un pánico financiero en 1884; para hacer dinero, empezó a escribir sobre la guerra. El escritor Samuel Clemens negoció un contrato ventajoso para él. Al diagnosticarle cáncer de garganta, Grant se puso un límite de tiempo para terminar el libro y murió poco después de completarlo. Aquí se lo retrata cerca del final. Un enorme éxito de ventas, Las Memorias de Grant, benefició a su familia. El libro es una de las grandes obras de la literatura estadounidense. La claridad de la prosa limpia y escueta se anticipa a la escritura moderna estadounidense. También constituye una historia de valor incalculable de la guerra que Grant desató de forma tan implacable.

40679,"African American minister Jesse Jackson emerged as one of several influential national civil rights leaders following the assassination of his mentor, Martin Luther King Jr., in 1968. At the time, he was working for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference as the national chairman of Operation Breadbasket, focusing his efforts on the economic empowerment of blacks. In 1970 Time magazine commissioned Jacob Lawrence to paint this cover portrait for an issue devoted to the role of contemporary black leaders in the continuing struggle for equality under the law. The selection of this mainstream African American artist was appropriate. While not known for his work as a portrait painter, part of Lawrence's reputation had come from his dual series of narrative works, produced from 1938 to 1940, illustrating the lives of two major black figures in the nineteenth-century fight for freedom-Frederick Douglass and Harriet Tubman.  "
40680,"Time magazine portrait of Martin Luther King Jr.   The success of the Montgomery bus boycott catapulted King into the national spotlight. In February 1957, Time featured his portrait on its cover and published an in-depth profile describing the twenty-eight-year-old pastor as ""one of the nation’s remarkable leaders."" The article declared that ""King reached beyond lawbooks and writs, beyond violence and threats, to win his people—and challenge all people––with a spiritual force that aspired even to ending prejudice in man’s mind."" When asked about the inspiration for his actions, King replied, ""The spirit of passive resistance came to me from the Bible and the teachings of Jesus. The techniques of execution came from Gandhi."" Just a month before the Time article appeared, sixty black ministers from across the South had gathered at King’s invitation in Atlanta to cofound what became known as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC)—an organization dedicated to utilizing nonviolent direct action to challenge and defeat racism.

40735,"Born Edinburgh, Scotland  Inventor Alexander Graham Bell sparked a communications revolution when he patented the telephone in 1876. But Bell considered his work with the deaf to be his true calling. Born to a deaf mother and a father renowned for his work in enunciation, Bell adapted his father’s work—a visual, symbolic alphabet for use in producing spoken sounds—for use in teaching speech to the deaf. He opened a teacher training school and became a leader in the education of the deaf. Bell’s teaching speech to the deaf was not viewed favorably by all; many advocates thought signing was the appropriate language for the hearing-impaired. "
40809,"Over his long, calculated, and prize-winning career as America’s best-loved poet, Robert Frost became the epitome of the New England Yankee: a weathered, craggy, flinty, and plainspoken countryman who turned ordinary life into poetry. Ironies abound. He was born in San Francisco and named after Robert E. Lee. Stereotyped as a regionalist, Frost received a major boost from the rootless modernist Ezra Pound. Uniquely American, Frost’s first two books were assembled and published in England before appearing in his homeland. Seemingly artless, because it is about artless subjects, Frost’s verse was a complicated formalist response to modernism—and to democracy. Frost did the most difficult thing: he made the complex weave of his poems appear easy or natural, leading to their persistent underestimation. Seemingly straightforward and reverential, his poems are sly, subversive. There was no less-traveled road in ""The Road Not Taken""; both paths are equally unworn, and the choice is false—or more terrifyingly, meaningless. As the years advanced, the Yankee persona won more often than not, and he tapped into a complacent, conservative populism, one that was not as benign or as avuncular as his audience sometimes assumed. Recovering that ""lost past’s / detail"" was Frost’s original task, one that cropped like granite through his most powerful work."
40963,"This image, which leaves the distinct impression that fashion designer Elizabeth Hawes is about to commit a voodoo-like act, sums up her singular place in American fashion history. On the one hand, Hawes was a successful designer, capable of turning out meticulously crafted, elegantly simple clothes that her clients delighted in wearing. At the same time, however, she could be one of the fashion world's fiercest critics, often pointing out the absurdities in the profession. Among her best known efforts in that line was Fashion Is Spinach (1938). Declaring the whole notion of fashion ""a complete anachronism in modern life,"" the book focused most of its barbs on those arbiters of taste who could make women feel hopelessly inadequate if they failed, for example, to have the season's requisite two silver foxes draped about their necks."
40968,"On June 19, 1864, one of the war's most celebrated sea battles occurred off the coast of France. Having sunk many Union merchant vessels, the raider CSS Alabama had just put into port for repairs when the USS Kearsarge discovered her. Confederate Captain Raphael Semmes, buoyed up by more than sixty naval victories, challenged Captain John A. Winslow to a duel. The Confederate gunners, however, had had little practice against armed vessels, and the Kearsarge sank the notorious Alabama in little more than an hour. A major event in Europe, the encounter inspired this picture published in Hamburg. The third ship seen in the print is the English yacht Deerhound, which rescued many of the Alabama's crew."
40994,"Shortly after the ratification of the Adams-Onís Treaty, which transferred political control of Florida to the United States, Joseph Marion Hernández became the first Hispanic to serve in the U.S. Congress. Born in St. Augustine to Minorcan émigrés, he was a territorial delegate-able to voice an opinion but not vote-from September 1822 to March 1823. After returning to Florida, he acquired land through purchases and grants, becoming quite wealthy. He participated in the Seminole War and accepted Osceola's surrender in 1837. For his efforts in this vicious struggle, he gained the title of brigadier general in the Florida Militia. When Florida became a state in 1845, Hernández ran again for Congress, lost, retired to Cuba, and died there. It is not known what took him to Washington in 1841, where Auguste Edouart, a Frenchman who was in America between 1839 and 1849, made this jaunty image.    Poco después de la ratificación del Tratado de Adams-Onís, que transfirió el control político de Florida a los Estados Unidos, Joseph Marion Hernández se convirtió en el primer miembro hispano del Congreso de los Estados Unidos. Nacido en San Agustín de inmigrantes menorquines, fue delegado territorial -con derecho a voz, pero no a voto- desde septiembre de 1822 hasta marzo de 1823. A su regreso a Florida, adquirió tierras por medio de compras y concesiones, haciéndose bastante rico. Participó en la Guerra de los Seminolas, y aceptó la rendición de Osceola en 1837. Por sus esfuerzos en esta lucha atroz, alcanzó el título de brigadier en la Milicia de Florida. Cuando Florida se convirtió en estado en 1845, Hernández se presentó otra vez para el Congreso, perdió, y se retiró a Cuba donde murió. No se sabe qué lo llevó a Washington en 1841, donde Auguste Edouart, un francés que residió en América entre 1839 y 1849, compuso esta imagen alegre."
41004,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Convinced that being ""a definite personality"" was one of the keys to stardom, W. C. Fields invented a larger-than-life persona as a loveable misanthrope that was part and parcel of the comic characters he portrayed. After an early career as a masterful juggler on the vaudeville circuit, Fields found his way to Broadway in 1915, where he joined Florenz Ziegfeld’s celebrated Follies and honed his comedic skills. He scored a hit as a small-time con artist in the Broadway musical Poppy (1923) and reprised the role in D. W. Griffith’s Sally of the Sawdust (1925)—just one of the many silent films that showcased his talent. Fields made the transition to talking pictures with ease, delivering memorable performances in movies such as David Copperfield (1935), The Bank Dick (1940), and My Little Chickadee (1940), for which he wrote the original screenplay with co-star Mae West. "
41005,"A painter whose artistic journey took him from youthful experimentations with cubism and abstract expressionism to the cerebral, geometric compositions of his mature period, Felrath Hines strove to create works that offered ""visual as well as spiritual pleasure."" Trained at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Hines moved to New York in 1946, where he joined an activist circle of African American writers, artists, and performers who included James Baldwin, Harry Belafonte, and Billy Strayhorn. Achieving moderate success in one-person exhibitions and group shows throughout the 1950s and 1960s, Hines embarked on a second career in fine art conservation in 1962, and later served as chief conservator at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery and the Hirshhorn Museum. Hines never abandoned painting, however, and experienced his most productive period of art-making during the final decade of his life.  "
41055,"Philip H. Sheridan (1831–1888) was a lifelong soldier from his West Point graduation in 1853 until just before his death. His leadership capabilities came to the fore in the last year of the Civil War, when he took command of the Union cavalry in Virginia and made it an effective fighting arm of the U.S. Army. With the return of peace, Sheridan was assigned commands in Texas, patrolling the border with Mexico, and in Louisiana, enforcing Reconstruction policies that protected voting rights, especially for blacks. The Indian Wars in the West occupied Sheridan for most of the 1870s, especially the Great Sioux War of 1876–77, in which George A. Custer and some 200 cavalrymen were killed at the Battle of Little Big Horn. Custer is seen in this photograph—taken in Topeka, Kansas, in 1872—wearing a fur-trimmed coat and sitting beside Sheridan."
41081,"Born Tuskegee, Alabama    With a courageous act of civil disobedience, Rosa Parks sparked a challenge to segregation that culminated in one of the seminal victories of the modern civil rights movement. On December 1, 1955, while traveling on a public bus in Montgomery, Alabama, the seamstress was arrested for refusing the driver's demand that she surrender her seat to a white male passenger. When Parks was convicted of violating local segregation laws, Montgomery's African American community launched a massive one-day boycott of the city's bus system. The boycott expanded with the help of Martin Luther King Jr. to last 382 days, ending only after the U.S. Supreme Count ruled bus segregation unconstitutional. "
41093,"The scowling stolidity of this likeness bespeaks an individual who did not mind a little controversy. And Emma Goldman not only tolerated controversy, she welcomed it with open arms. Born in Russia, she became a convert to anarchism in 1890, and in advancing her cause's drive, she readily accepted resorting to violent tactics. Among her first acts as an anarchist was collaboration in an attempt to assassinate Carnegie Steel executive Henry Clay Frick in 1892. Finally, America had its fill of ""Red Emma."" In 1919 she was deported to Russia, where she soon became disillusioned with its new Bolshevik regime.  This picture dates from a brief visit to the United States that authorities allowed Goldman to make in 1934. When asked by a reporter if time had modified any of her ideas, she answered ""no,"" adding, ""I was always considered bad; I'm worse now."""
41130,"No one ever craved the presidency more than Theodore Roosevelt or used its powers more joyously. In early 1901, however, his rise toward that office was suddenly checked. Having gained national prominence as a civil service reformer, Spanish-American War hero, and reform-minded governor of New York, he was now relegated to being William McKinley's vice president. But McKinley's assassination several months later changed everything, and Roosevelt was soon rushing headlong into one of American history's most productive presidencies. By the time he left office in 1909, his accomplishments ranged from implementing landmark efforts to conserve the nation's disappearing natural heritage, to instituting some of the first significant curbs on the excesses of big business, to building the Panama Canal.  When Hungarian-born English artist Philip de Lászlo painted the original version of this portrait, he encouraged Roosevelt to have visitors chat with him during the sittings, apparently thinking that it made for a more animated likeness.  "
41168,"Best remembered for his magisterial ten-volume History of the United States (1834-74)-one of the first comprehensive histories of America-George Bancroft also played an active part in Democratic Party politics in the 1840s. Though defeated in the campaign for governor of Massachusetts in 1844, he was tapped the following year by James K. Polk for the post of secretary of navy. In this position Bancroft acted decisively in supporting the newly elected president's expansionist policies. In the lead-up to the Mexican War, he directed the Pacific naval squadron to occupy San Francisco Harbor and other key California ports. Then, having been reassigned as the acting secretary of war, Bancroft ordered General Zachary Taylor to lead his military force into the contested Texas borderland-an action that led directly to war with Mexico. Following Taylor's victory in the 1848 presidential election, Bancroft left public office and returned to his work as a historian."
41260,"Thirty-fifth president 1961-63     When an assassin's bullets ended the life of John F. Kennedy in November 1963, America experienced a collective sense of loss it had not known since the death of Franklin Roosevelt in 1945. Unlike Roosevelt, the loss was not that of an indispensable leader in a time of great crisis, but an expression of unfulfilled promise, a young president cut down. Kennedy had charmed Americans with his grace and eloquence, inspired them with his ""New Frontier,"" and challenged them to overcome all ""burdens"" and ""hardships."" An initial foreign policy fiasco, the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, was later followed by success in forcing the Soviet Union to remove its missiles from Cuba. For many Americans the violent ending of Kennedy's life not only abruptly terminated a promising presidency but tested their confidence in America.    William Franklin Draper's depiction of Kennedy in a rocking chair was unintentionally ironic because, unknown at the time, the young and ""vigorous"" president was beset by serious health problems. "
41299,"Davidson met reformist journalist Lincoln Steffens, author of The Shame of the Cities (1904), at the beginning of World War I in New York. They became lifelong friends, traveling to France on the same ship in 1918. While Davidson made portraits in Paris, Steffens went to Moscow as a member of a secret mission sent to observe and report on the new Bolshevik government. Steffens told Davidson, ""I have seen the future, and it works!"" Steffens later wrote about Davidson's portrait sessions with world leaders, saying that the artist brought back ""more than a likeness. He had conversations to repeat, and such conversations!"" "
41333,"Robert Penn Warren is one of the most gifted and prolific American authors of the latter twentieth century; his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, All the King's Men (1946) is one of the most significant books in American literature. Educated at Vanderbilt, Warren first gained attention as one of the ""Agrarians,"" a group of conservative southern writers who wanted to slow social change, especially in race relations. Warren was too progressive for the group and subsequently recanted his early support for racial segregation, becoming an important voice for integration. Warren made the South the theme of his writings, which were voluminous. A major novelist, he was also an important poet, one whose combination of the vernacular and modernism achieved the fusion of the old and the new, which he had attempted to find-unsuccessfully-with the Agrarians. He was twice poet laureate of the United States."
41394,"Born Atlanta, Georgia   One of the most idolized sports heroes of his day, Bobby Jones was instrumental in popularizing the game of golf in America. Between 1923 and 1930, Jones won thirteen major golf titles in Britain and the United States. Unlike the majority of his rivals, he competed as an amateur, believing that golf’s ""proper place"" was for ""recreation and enjoyment."" His greatest year was 1930, when he completed golf’s Grand Slam, winning all four of the year’s major tournaments. Later that year, he surprised many by retiring from tournament play at age twenty-eight. Although he returned to Atlanta to open a law practice, he never left the game. In addition to producing instructional films and writing books about golf, he also helped to found the Augusta National Golf Club and in 1934 the annual tournament known as the Masters."
41395,"Born New York City  Katharine Nash Rhoades left her prominent New York family for an extensive European tour with two friends, sculptor Malvina Hoffman and painter Marion Beckett, when she was twenty-three. Although she had taken private art lessons since the age of nineteen, her travels abroad solidified her desire to pursue a career as an artist. On her return, Alfred Stieglitz published her poetry in his periodical, Camera Work. When he exhibited her Fauvist paintings at his 291 gallery in 1915, critics noted that she had “not been studying with any one, but [has been] in Paris, and that has been enough.” This is one of multiple photographs that Stieglitz made of Rhoades at the time of her exhibition at his gallery, shortly before he met and photographed Georgia O’Keeffe. The print belonged to Rhoades and remained in her family until it was presented to the National Portrait Gallery."
41430,"Joseph E. Johnston joined the Confederate army as a leading contender for high command. His brilliant performance at the First Battle of Manassas earned him a general's commission and seemed to foretell further military successes. Yet his promotion was the beginning of a difficult working relationship with Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The two simply did not trust each other. When assigned to command in Tennessee and Mississippi, Johnston complained that his orders were insufficient and lacked authority. In turn, when the strategic river town of Vicksburg fell into Union hands, Davis blamed Johnston for circumstances beyond his immediate control.  What impaired Johnston most was his over-cautiousness, which his superiors interpreted as passivity. He liked ideal situations in which his army had a numerical edge and could take the defensive, but at no time was the Confederacy ever blessed with superior numbers.  "
41442,"In 1923, having given up on her ambitions to be a sculptor, Berenice Abbott found herself in Paris wondering what to do next. When photographer Man Ray mentioned his need for an assistant, Abbott asked, ""How about me?"" and he took her on. Although Abbott knew virtually nothing about photography, she was a quick learner. By 1926 she had her own studio and was doing a thriving business photographing such literary notables as Jean Cocteau and James Joyce. Over the next few years, Abbott's interests shifted away from portraiture, and by the early 1930s, she was chronicling the life and architecture of New York City with her camera. At their best, the resulting pictures had a time-and-place immediacy that continues to entrance viewers, and they remain one of her most important accomplishments."
41534,"Born Charles County, Maryland    A wealthy planter and merchant who owned some 11,000 acres in Maryland at his death, Daniel of St. Thomas Jenifer held numerous public offices before, during, and after the American Revolution. In 1760 he helped to settle the boundary dispute between Pennsylvania and Maryland that resulted in the establishment of the Mason-Dixon line. Before the colonies' break with England, Jenifer served on the Royal Governor's Council and closely aligned himself with Maryland's conservative ruling elements. When Anglo-American hostilities broke out in 1775, however, he sided with Maryland's rebelling forces and proved invaluable in marshaling support for their cause. In subsequent years, he served in the Continental Congress and helped to draw up the Constitution. John Hesselius, whose father Gustavus was also an artist, painted this likeness of Jenifer when the subject was still part of Maryland's colonial government."
41538,"Fred Astaire was known as a ""cool cat"" among dancers, and he left a crucial artistic message for the challenges of modernity: be light on your feet. Astaire’s artistic synthesis of tap and ballet, his extraordinary sure-footed rhythmic balance, and his devil-may-care nonchalance all remain cultural emblems of surviving with style. Astaire was composer Irving Berlin’s favorite singer, and he created a singular persona: a self-assured bohemian in a top hat and tails. Astaire revolutionized dance in film: he insisted that directors eschew close-ups and instead film the flow of dancers across the floor, making of his duets with Ginger Rogers a set of kinetic, seemingly effortless improvisations. In an age filled with images of exhausted factory workers, he and other tap dancers reminded Depression-era audiences of the physical grace, humor, and joy of the human body. Astaire embodied Irving Berlin’s best piece of cultural advice: Let’s face the music and dance."
41618,"A daguerreotypist and photographer in her own right, Mary Ann Meade worked for many years in her brothers’ photography business. After Charles’s death in 1858, Mary Ann began to gain greater visibility for her role in the gallery’s operations. She was listed as a photographer in Trow’s New York City Directory for 1861–62, and in February 1861 an article about renovations to the Meade Brothers gallery noted, ""Mr. [Henry] Meade and his sister attend personally to visitors."" In 1862, Mary Ann Meade became the gallery’s director."
41647,"Although any fictitious face would have passed as a likeness of Washington at the start of the American Revolution, an authentic image, based on a 1776 portrait by Charles Willson Peale, soon spread rapidly in prints and illustrations. Peale's own modest little mezzotint engraving of ""His Excellency Gen. Washington"" featured a long nose, almond-shaped eyes, and curls of hair at either side. That face was copied so frequently over the next two decades-appearing in engravings, books, magazines, almanacs, broadsides, and children's primers-that Washington's contemporaries recognized even the crudest versions. Various prints by engraver John Norman added cannon, banners, drums, and swags to the Peale image and were subsequently copied in relief for such ephemeral publications as The Federal Almanack. This unprecedented dissemination of a famous face suggests that Washington's legendary symbolic status began during his own lifetime."
41668,"Of mixed Native American and white ancestry, Jim Thorpe was raised as a Sac and Fox and attended the Carlisle (Pennsylvania) Indian School, where in 1907 his all-around athletic skills began to be noticed. Thorpe excelled at football, baseball, and track and field, and in 1912 he won the intercollegiate ballroom dancing championship. At the 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm, Sweden, he easily won gold medals in the pentathlon and the decathlon. Months later, it was discovered that Thorpe had previously played professional baseball and should have been ineligible to compete. Consequently, his medals were revoked. But in 1983, the International Olympic Committee reversed its decision, partly due to an earlier technicality, and Thorpe's medals were reinstated. In 1999, Thorpe was ranked third on the Associated Press's list of greatest athletes of the twentieth century, behind Babe Ruth and Michael Jordan."
41699,"This well-known portrait by Man Ray is about both the collection that hung in the atelier at 27, rue de Fleurus and its occupants. The artist was seeing Stein’s collection and meeting the two women for the first time. He had Toklas and Stein sit on either side of the fireplace they had recently installed in the atelier, their bodies subsumed in the domestic furniture, pictures, and decorative objects. Their relationship to each other is unclear; they could be sisters, friends, or two educated, well-off, unmarried women sharing a household—what was then called a “Boston marriage.” Stein sits comfortably and confidently in her ample armchair, and Toklas sits upright in one of the two small chairs she would later cover with petit point, based on designs Picasso made for her. "
41717,"Attaining a ""more perfect"" union required that each citizen in antebellum society strive for moral and physical perfection. Susan B. Anthony began her reform career campaigning against drink but soon realized that women could have only a limited impact on the culture if they did not attain political equality with men. After being forbidden from speaking at a temperance rally because of her gender, Anthony became a wholehearted activist for women's suffrage. For Anthony, just as slavery had divided the Union against itself, so the nation could not survive as long as full political participation was denied to half the population.   "
41727,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
41859,"Born Whitingham, Vermont    Brigham Young converted to Mormonism in 1832, and gradually rose in the leadership structure until he became the head of the Twelve Apostles under Joseph Smith. After Smith’s murder by an anti-Mormon mob in 1844, Young assumed leadership of the larger portion of the church. In 1847 he led the Mormons from Nebraska to the Great Basin, where he founded Salt Lake City as the new church headquarters. He oversaw the migration of tens of thousands of Mormon converts to the West and the founding of hundreds of settlements. The Mormon majority elected Young as governor, but he was soon replaced by an appointed territorial governor. Political conflicts and challenges to the Mormons’ separatist communal and theocratic venture led the United States to dispatch troops to Utah in 1857 and assert federal authority. "
41875,"Born Highland County, Ohio  After deciding not to run for a second term as president, Theodore Roosevelt picked a successor, Secretary of War William Howard Taft. By 1910, however, Roosevelt was dissatisfied with his protégé, convinced that Taft had aligned himself with the conservative wing of the Republican Party in areas like conservation and had rejected Roosevelt’s view of the president as the ""steward of the public welfare."" In 1912 Roosevelt challenged Taft for the Republican presidential nomination, knowing he could not win, and split the party. He then formed the Progressive (""Bull Moose"") Party, which espoused the regulation of corporations and promoted income and inheritance taxes; medical, unemployment, and old age insurance; and women’s suffrage. He is shown here with Albert Beveridge—a Republican senator from Indiana until he split with party conservatives and lost his seat—who followed Roosevelt into the new Progressive Party. "
41900,"As a two-term congressman and former territorial governor, William Henry Harrison could lay no claim to proven abilities in political leadership. But his reputation as a frontier Indian fighter and hero of the War of 1812 amply made up for this, and in 1840 the Whigs eagerly made him their presidential standard-bearer. In the so-called ""hard cider"" campaign that followed, Harrison's supporters celebrated his military prowess and combined it with homespun frontier imagery that was unprecedented for its carnival-like brouhaha. While discussion of real issues was avoided, that brouhaha proved sufficient in itself to win Harrison the presidency.  Jubilance over his victory, however, proved short-lived. Soon after delivering the longest inaugural address ever made, Harrison contracted pneumonia and, on April 4, 1841, became the first president to die in office.  "
42067,"Time’s September 26, 1969, cover story about the rise of drug use, especially of marijuana and barbiturates among the young, was timely, to say the least. Just the month before, at the Woodstock music festival, it was estimated that “some 90% of the 400,000 participants openly smoked marijuana.” And the week before the magazine ran its story, the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency “began hearings to consider new legislation on drugs” as part of the Nixon administration’s push to toughen drug laws. But many experts argued that the laws were already inequitable and widely unenforceable. In the case of marijuana use, a senior administrator of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, testified that he knew of “no clearer instance in which the punishment for an infraction of the law is more harmful than the crime.”  Las drogas y los jóvenes     El artículo del 26 de septiembre de 1969 acerca del auge en el consumo de drogas entre los jóvenes, sobre todo marihuana y barbitúricos, fue oportuno, por decir lo menos. Justo un mes antes, en el festival de música de Woodstock, se calculó que “cerca del 90% de los 400,000 asistentes fumaron marihuana abiertamente”. Y la semana previa a la publicación del artículo, el Subcomité del Senado sobre la Delincuencia Juvenil “inició vistas para considerar nueva legislación sobre las drogas” como parte de las gestiones de la administración de Nixon para endurecer las leyes antidrogas. Pero muchos expertos afirmaban que las leyes eran poco equitativas y en gran medida imposibles de ejecutar. En el caso de la marihuana, un alto administrador del Departamento de Salud, Educación y Bienestar Social testificó que no conocía “instancia más clara en que el castigo por una infracción fuera más dañino que el crimen mismo”.

42091,"I place no value upon literal transcripts from Nature, wrote the artist Thomas Moran in 1879. ""My general scope is not realistic; all my tendencies are towards idealization."" Inspired by romantic literature, Moran painted canvases that transformed the West into an Edenic paradise. As a member of several government expeditions into the West, Moran had firsthand experience with the awe-inspiring vistas he later interpreted in his work. He traveled to Yellowstone in 1871, before it became a national park, and the work that resulted from this trip helped to popularize it as a tourist destination. Curiously, however, when westward expansion encroached upon the pristine wilderness, Moran did not include the telltale signs of civilization's progress. Even in his old age Moran continued to paint with fervor. As one reporter observed in 1922, ""He was the picture of intensity and energy. I never saw such concentration."" "
42102,"This lithograph was part of a series published by Charles Lester titled the Gallery of Illustrious Americans. Containing twenty-four lithographs based on photographs by Mathew Brady, the series was sold via subscription. The subjects were all men of note, such as President Zachary Taylor and other leading politicians, including the fire-eating South Carolinian John C. Calhoun. Calhoun’s career had traversed the spectrum of antebellum American politics, from his fervent nationalism during the War of 1812 to his full-throated advocacy of nullification and states’ rights in the 1830s and 1840s. By 1849 he was laying the theoretical and political justification for southern secession over what he called the conspiracy to abolish slavery. He died during the negotiations over the Compromise of 1850, in which he held the position that there could be no interference in southern institutions.  Mathew Brady made the original photograph in 1848–49, but Calhoun had probably passed away before this lithograph was made. "
42241,"When Chaliapin painted this portrait of Betty Hutton for Time’s cover in April 1950, the twenty-nine-year-old actress’s spunk and high energy were well known both in and outside of Hollywood. The artist’s challenge was how to corral all of that ""unbridled vitality"" onto a magazine cover. ""Betty’s all-out assault on an audience,"" reported Time, ""is a trademark that she carries in every appearance, public or private."" By movie standards, she was not ""remarkably pretty . . . nor a remarkably good singer or dancer,"" but watching her in action was a little like ""waiting for a wildly sputtering fuse to touch off an alarmingly large firecracker."" She was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for her role as Annie in the film version of Annie Get Your Gun (1950). Moreover, her performance was compared favorably to that of her sensational predecessor for Annie on Broadway, ""brassy Ethel Merman."""
42306,"Millard Fillmore was the second vice president to accede to the White House upon a president's sudden death-that of President Zachary Taylor on July 9, 1850..  Born in a log cabin in Cayuga County, New York, Fillmore was a self-made man who rose to be a wealthy lawyer and a leader of the Whig Party in his state. In 1848 he was nominated as vice president to help attract northerners to the ticket. While in office, Fillmore aptly carried out his only constitutional duty-to preside over the Senate-during the tumultuous debates about passage of the Compromise of 1850 and the extension of slavery into the western territories. His support of the compromise as president, especially the Fugitive Slave Act and its enforcement, angered northern Whigs, who worked to defeat his nomination for president in 1852.   "
42353,"On May 5, 1985, President Reagan and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited a military cemetery outside of Bitburg, Germany, laying a wreath to honor Germany’s war dead. Several weeks before Reagan’s trip, the White House was informed that forty-eight Hitler SS storm troopers were also buried at Bitburg. Congressional resolutions, World War II veterans, Holocaust survivors, clergy, and even Nancy Reagan urged the president to cancel the cemetery visit. Reagan, who could be stubborn under pressure, wrote in his diary, “There is no way I’ll back down.” Time feared that the “Bitburg episode cut deep into the veneer of postwar friendships.” However, thousands of Germans lined the motorcade route with signs expressing their appreciation to Reagan. At home, polls indicated that Americans approved of Reagan’s actions.   "

42401,"For cover artists like Chaliapin, the mastery of their art was in conveying the essence of the cover story while capturing an insightful likeness. Chaliapin’s assignment for the December 20, 1948, cover of Time was especially challenging, as he had to portray the lovely actress Olivia de Havilland in her role as a woman with schizophrenia in the new motion picture The Snake Pit. Although she had won an Academy Award for Best Actress the year before in To Each His Own, de Havilland was only just reaching her stride in a career that would span three more decades. Chaliapin’s solution for this cover was a double portrait. He was of one mind with the cover story writer, who noted, ""One of the most striking things in The Snake Pit is its faces—the blanched, defenseless, suspicious, suffering faces, oddly but not artily assembled, which form the tragic chorus to the story."""
42436,"Wilshire Bowl Restaurant mural designs (studies #4)  John Decker—caricaturist, portrait painter, Hollywood personality, and friend of many actors—was a firsthand witness to the emerging star system of the 1920s and the transition from silent pictures to the ""talkies."" Decker created these vivid panels as mural studies for the Wilshire Bowl Restaurant, a popular Hollywood nightspot. Installed in 1941, the original murals, now lost, portrayed the sweep of film history, from the Keystone Kops and the ""Perils of Pauline"" to the film idols of the 1930s. The top panel shown here depicts such titans of the silent era as Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, Harold Lloyd, William S. Hart, and Gloria Swanson. The bottom panel includes Joe E. Brown, Greta Garbo, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart, W. C. Fields, Mae West, and George Arliss, many of whom had started their careers in silent movies."
42503,"The birth of photography in 1839 provided a new means of recording and disseminating likenesses of America's presidents. The first photographic method employed for this purpose was the daguerreotype, which yielded mirrorlike images remarkable for their detail and sense of immediacy. Soon, sophisticated portraits of presidents emerged from the studios of such daguerreotypists as Mathew Brady or Southworth and Hawes. As one-of-a kind objects produced without the use of negatives, original daguerreotypes of the presidents enjoyed only limited circulation. But reproduced as wood engravings in illustrated newspapers or as popular prints, these images reached countless Americans who could never have hoped to see their president in person.  "
42545,"Wes Wilson, who designed Bill Graham's first Fillmore Auditorium ads, was ""probably the most influential designer of hippie posters,"" according to Graphis magazine in 1968. In this poster, he embedded a photograph of the Butterfield Blues Band into a background of swirling shapes, unexpected colors, and odd lettering. Wilson recalled selecting his colors from hallucinatory experiences with LSD. His manipulation of words was particularly trendsetting. Wilson liked working freehand and filling up the space with ornament, so when he encountered a book of turn-of-the-century Viennese Secessionist posters, he adapted their sinuous lettering to his own art. ""Playing with foreground and background,"" he noted, ""helped me work out patterns and shapes."" Much to Graham's frustration, Wilson's habit of burying pertinent information underneath ""oozes and ebbs and flows and liquidy movement"" often made his (and subsequent designers') posters illegible, but it did encourage viewers to stare longer."

42631,"The “Athenaeum” portrait    American artist Gilbert Stuart was commissioned to paint this portrait after the success of his first portrait of Washington in 1795. Martha Washington convinced the president to sit again because, according to artist Rembrandt Peale, she “wished a Portrait for herself; he therefore consented on the express condition that when finished it should be hers.” Stuart, however, preferred this portrait to his earlier Washington; he purposely left it—and that of the first lady—unfinished so that he could use it as a model for the numerous copies that the first president’s admirers commissioned. After Stuart’s death, the two paintings were purchased for the Boston Athenaeum, which owned them for more than 150 years.  This image served as the basis for the engraving of Washington on the one-dollar bill. John Neal, an early-nineteenth-century writer and art critic, wrote: “Though a better likeness of him were shown to us, we should reject it; for, the only idea that we now have of George Washington, is associated with Stuart’s Washington.”"
42704,"When Helena Rubinstein immigrated to Australia from Poland, she carried a supply of facial cream, made in Hungary, for her own use. After Australian women began making envious comments about her complexion, Rubinstein saw a golden marketing opportunity, and she was soon selling her cream out of a shop in Melbourne. Within a few years, she had reaped a small fortune, and by 1915 she had created a cosmetic and beauty salon empire that had spas in London, Paris, and New York. Rubinstein once attributed her success to women's unabating desire to improve on nature. But every bit as crucial was Rubinstein's own drive-a drive that left her no time, she said, for the beauty regimen she sold to others. ""I tell you, I am a worker,"" she explained. ""I have no time for it."""
42722,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    Dr. John Morgan's noted student, Benjamin Rush, once remarked that Morgan's name should forever be linked with the birth of professionalism in American medicine. Having first worked on the western frontier as a military surgeon during the French and Indian War, Morgan pursued an advanced medical degree at Edinburgh University in Scotland. Upon returning home to Philadelphia in 1765, Morgan played a key role in the establishment of America's first medical school. During the Revolutionary War, he served two years as the director-general of the Hospital of the Army. In this position, Morgan confronted daunting medical challenges, including an outbreak of smallpox and also extraordinary infighting among army officials who were unaccustomed to a centralized medical service.  This portrait was created by noted Swiss-born artist Angelica Kauffmann in Rome during Morgan's visit there in 1764."
42744,"Born Tiffin, Ohio  Born to Irish immigrants, John Quinn established his reputation in his twenties as a brilliant lawyer in New York. His deep interest in contemporary literature led him to collect first editions of the work of John Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, Douglas Hyde, and other contemporary Irish writers. In time, Quinn’s literary interests shifted to modern art, and he soon became a significant collector. Armory Show organizer Walter Pach served as an art adviser to Quinn, who ultimately made his first art purchase at the 1913 show and continued to collect art based on Pach’s recommendations. Summarizing the importance of the Armory Show at its opening, Quinn said, ""it . . . [is] time the American people had an opportunity to see and judge for themselves concerning the work of the Europeans who are creating a new art."""
42780,"Davidson later noted that when portraying financier Andrew Mellon, Mellon and the artist discussed the terms of the arrangement, ""in a businesslike manner, befitting a Secretary of the Treasury."" To Davidson, Mellon's ""fine face, delicate complexion, white hair and mustache, suggested stone or terra-cotta."" But Mellon responded, ""I prefer bronze,"" and then suggested, ""You will do it in bronze, and if I don't like the bronze, you will do it in terra-cotta or stone?"" Davidson agreed. When the clay model for the bronze was completed, Mellon expressed his satisfaction, and on receiving the bronze, was ""very pleased with the finished work.""  "
42782,"In 1928, Franklin Roosevelt dubbed Al Smith, with his derby hat and ever-present cigar, the ""happy warrior."" As governor of New York, Smith sought to make government more responsive to immigrants and the poor by restricting working hours for women and children, increasing education funds, and building low-cost housing. As an urban progressive, he favored a large government role in solving social and economic problems. In the divisive issue of Prohibition, Smith opposed the Eighteenth Amendment, while many western and southern progressives viewed its ban on alcoholic beverages as an important reform. Smith's losing bid for the presidency, in which rural progressives held his Irish ethnicity and Catholicism against him, is often credited with making way for the New Deal, a program Smith opposed as a threat to freedom.  Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist Rollin Kirby published this drawing in the New York World.  "
42793,"On August 10, 1846, the United States Senate passed a bill to establish the Smithsonian Institution, which coincidentally occurred at the time this mezzotint was being offered for sale at ten dollars a copy. Nearly four years in the making, the picture was a composite of daguerreotypes taken during the past three sessions of Congress especially for this mezzotint. Individuals included prominent senators Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun, and former president John Quincy Adams, who was representing his Massachusetts district in the House of Representatives. Adams was an enthusiastic proponent for establishing the Smithsonian Institution, while Calhoun voted against the bill.   The year 1846 also marked the start of America's war with Mexico. Territory acquired from the vanquished Mexicans would ultimately fuel acrimonious debate about the most polarizing issue of that era-the extension of slavery into new territories."
42841,"On September 15, 1959, Nikita Khrushchev became the first head of state from the Soviet Union to visit the United States. In this photograph, President Eisenhower welcomes Khrushchev-sporting two Hero of Socialist Labor medals on his chest-at Andrews Air Force Base outside Washington. No sooner did Khrushchev touch American soil, however, than he began boasting about the Soviets' success in landing a rocket on the moon, which rankled Eisenhower. Ike turned the discussion to the merits of American free enterprise by taking his guest in a helicopter ride, pointing out the big suburban homes and the highways filled with private cars. Khrushchev, who had bragged that Soviet economic productivity would ""bury"" capitalism, remained unimpressed, but he did like the helicopter and, after asking Ike for a gift of one or two of them, bought three."
42903,"Born Crescent City, Florida    Civil rights activist A. Philip Randolph waged a lifelong battle for the economic empowerment of African Americans. In 1925 he accepted the challenge of organizing the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters-the first black labor union chartered by the American Federation of Labor. Continuing his advocacy for African American workers, Randolph called for a march on Washington in 1941 to protest the exclusion of blacks from defense industry jobs. He cancelled that march only after President Franklin Roosevelt signed an order mandating an end to discriminatory practices by government contractors. Following World War II, Randolph led the effort to desegregate the nation's armed forces and waged a civil disobedience campaign against the draft until President Harry Truman ordered an end to segregation in the military in 1948. Randolph crowned his career in 1963 by helping to organize the celebrated March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom."
42912,"For more than three decades, Babe Ruth's single-season tally of sixty home runs in 1927 stood as baseball's most hallowed record. But when a home-run duel ignited between Yankee teammates Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris in the summer of 1961, many fans found themselves rooting for Mantle to beat the Babe's mark. Since joining the ball club in 1951, the switch-hitting Mantle, with his huge swing and phenomenal power, had been widely regarded as the heir to such Yankee titans as Ruth and Lou Gehrig. Now, with four home-run titles and baseball's Triple Crown to his credit, Mantle seemed the natural choice to outdistance the newcomer Maris in the race for Ruth's record. The contest remained neck and neck until September when, sidelined by an infection, Mantle ended his quest at fifty-four home runs, while Maris powered ahead to a new record of sixty-one."
42938,"On May 5, 1961, Alan Shepard became the first American to journey into space, reaching an altitude of 116 miles. Although Shepard’s brief venture—it lasted only fifteen minutes—could not match the recent orbital journey of Russian cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin, the mission was critically important for national prestige, especially with all of the world watching. Shepard became an instant hero with the pinpoint splashdown of his capsule, Freedom 7, in the Atlantic. ""This is just a baby step,"" predicted his wife Louise, ""compared to what we will see"" in the future. Ten years later, Shepard made his second space flight as commander of Apollo 14 and became the only Mercury astronaut to walk on the moon. That critical mission spanned ten days."
42944,"Civil War Sheet Music  Civil War music usually fell into one of several categories: songs to rally the troops, spirituals sung by slaves, songs sung by families at home, and songs that reflected the homesickness many soldiers felt.

43025,"Frederick Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania, a former Lutheran minister and a member of the most prominent German family in America, was elected the first Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. A jolly fellow famous for his oyster suppers, Muhlenberg had considerable experience as a presiding officer; he had served a stint as president of the Continental Congress and had presided over the state convention called to ratify the Constitution in 1787. With President George Washington coming from the South and Vice President John Adams hailing from New England, Muhlenburg's selection provided a nice geographic balance for the new government's start.   Muhlenberg is pictured in the act of signing House Bill 65, ""An Act to regulate Trade and Intercourse with the Indian Tribes,"" which he did on July 20, 1790.  "
43031,"Endowed with a far-ranging intellectual curiosity, Talcott Williams began his career in journalism in the early 1870s. In 1881 he was named an editor of the Philadelphia Press. In 1912 he became the first director of the Columbia School of Journalism. At Columbia, Williams set high standards for his profession, constantly reiterating his conviction that good journalism required not only writing ability but also a wide breadth of knowledge.              Philadelphia-born, French-trained painter Thomas Eakins, who had been introduced two years earlier to the venerable American poet Walt Whitman by Williams, often asked his friends to pose. Many of these were bust portraits, and Eakins is noted for the variety he was able to achieve in this limited format. By depicting Williams with an expression of intense concentration on his face and his mouth open as though in conversation, Eakins succeeded in suggesting the energy, quick wit, and lively intelligence of his subject, who was known among friends as “Talk-a-lot” Williams."
43034,"Time photographer Diana Walker captures President George Bush during his Thanksgiving visit to American troops stationed in Saudi Arabia just prior to the start of the Gulf War. Bush later recalled, ""I had a pretty good idea on Thanksgiving of 1990 that we were going to have to fight. We were still trying diplomacy and using the United Nations and all that, but I had my mind set that we were going to have to go to war."" Although soldiers expressed to him their desire to begin the liberation of Kuwait, Bush continued, ""When I looked out at these faces, at this point I know I was thinking, 'How many of these kids are going to die for their country?'"" This late afternoon image shows Bush throwing souvenirs to the soldiers who have gathered around him."
43137,"Born in Hiwassee, Cherokee Nation (present-day Polk County, Tennessee)   Major Ridge, or Kah-nung-da-cla-geh, whose commercial enterprises made him wealthy, fought bravely in the Creek War of 1814. As a Cherokee leader he urged his people to modernize and acculturate but resisted white encroachments on Cherokee land. In the early 1830s, as the pressure of white settlement intensified, Ridge, his son John, nephew Elias Boudinot, and their followers began to doubt that the Cherokee could retain their land. Reversing themselves, they argued that they must move west to retain their traditions. In 1835 Ridge’s minority faction signed the Treaty of New Echota, relinquishing Cherokee lands for a new home in the West. The Cherokee who resisted were forced to leave during the harsh winter of 1838–39 in a march called the Trail of Tears. In June 1839, Ridge, his son, and Boudinot were condemned by a tribal court and assassinated by disgruntled members of the tribe on that same day."
43245,"After the Union army's defeat at the First Battle of Manassas on July 21, 1861, President Lincoln appointed thirty-four-year-old General George B. McClellan to command federal operations in Virginia. Within weeks, ""Little Mac"" transformed the remnants of a demoralized volunteer army into a disciplined fighting machine and christened it the Army of the Potomac.  But achieving victory required engaging the enemy in battle, and in this McClellan procrastinated, much to Lincoln's exasperation. When he did lead his troops into battle, he was slow to advance and quick to retreat. Finally, after McClellan failed to pursue Robert E. Lee's army following the Union's victory at the Battle of Antietam in September 1862, Lincoln relieved him of his command. McClellan reemerged briefly in national politics in 1864 as the Democratic Party's unsuccessful presidential candidate.  "
43288,"This print resulted from a friendship that developed in 1798 between Thomas Jefferson and Tadeusz Kosciuszko, a Polish-born patriot who had fought in the American Revolution. General Kosciuszko returned to the United States in 1797. An amateur artist trained in topographical drawing, he persuaded Jefferson to sit for a profile likeness. Kosciuszko took his now-lost watercolor portrait to Paris, where it was engraved by the Polish nobleman Michel Sokolnicki. Jefferson received four copies of the print from Kosciuszko and gave some of them away to family and friends, including James Madison."
43395,"Robert Zimmerman took his stage name from the Welsh romantic poet Dylan Thomas and his music from the politically charged folk songs of Woody Guthrie. Moving to New York City in 1961, he soon became, along with Joan Baez, the dominant voice in American folk music. While successful, Bob Dylan found himself confined by the formulas of the folk scene and, influenced by English rock and rollers, went electric in 1965, to the derision of his hardcore fans and to the amazement of rock's growing audience. In a career of many phases, Dylan has made surprise his hallmark, frequently emerging from a period of isolation with an entirely new sound. As recently as 1997, Time Out of Mind garnered an Album of the Year Grammy. When a critic downplayed it as ""derivative,"" he was reminded that it was only ""derivative"" of Dylan's genius itself.  "
43407,"Ronald Reagan wrote his own speeches before becoming president, and he edited or personally wrote many he gave as president. When in late 1994 he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, the former president decided to inform the American people of his condition. Nancy Reagan thought it would be too difficult for him to write about the subject, but, as his wife described the scene, he simply sat down and wrote it, with only one small cross-out.    "
43413,"This is an Original Portrait of Genl Washington taken in 1797, wrote Martha Washington's granddaughter Eliza Parke Custis in an inExhibition scription framed with this profile drawing. ""It was painted by Mr. Sharpless & is an exact likeness except the complexion Genl Washington was very fair with light brown almost auburn hair-he had not a black beard. He had artificial teeth but so well fixed, that they did not disfigure his mouth."" Just as the president was leaving office, English-born artist James Sharples made one of the last life portraits for which Washington would sit. Washington's profile was taken with a mechanical instrument to ensure accuracy.  "
43456,"Born Oak Park, Illinois  In 1954, when writer Ernest Hemingway received the Nobel Prize for Literature, he was cited especially for his ""mastery of the art of modern narration."" But in his novels, such as The Sun Also Rises and For Whom the Bell Tolls, and in his many brilliant short stories as well, Hemingway had not merely mastered a new literary style. In large degree he had invented it, and his emotionless and succinct writing ultimately became a major influence in determining the direction of twentieth-century American literature.  Hemingway first met artist Waldo Peirce in Europe in 1927, and years later he would describe Peirce, who shared his passion for hunting and fishing, as ""the best company anybody ever had."" Peirce’s drawing of Hemingway dates from the several months in 1928 that they spent together in Key West, Florida. The picture is inscribed to the artist’s son Jonathan from ""Papa,"" a nickname often applied to Hemingway by his friends."
43507,"When Milton Avery made this self-portrait in 1938, he was emerging as a masterful American painter with a devoted following. His later work, with its brighter layered colors and strongly outlined flat forms, attracted many of the young artists who would be leaders of the abstract expressionist movement. Although best known as a colorist, Avery was an inveterate draftsman, fascinated with linear effects. In this drawing, the interplay of freely rendered lines evokes a variety of textures, from the artist's thinning hair to his warm sweater. A closer view reveals the graceful hooked lines of his technique and the artist's clear delight in linear pattern. The drawing also reflects Avery's habit of drawing his family and friends: inside and on the back of the folded page are lively scenes of his daughter March and seascapes from a family vacation.  "
43555,"When this image was taken in 1863, J.E.B. Stuart was in command of the cavalry in Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Lee relied heavily on Stuart's ability to gather intelligence about the enemy's strengths and whereabouts and to screen his own army's movements. Stuart's cavalry tactics became legendary, and success drove him to new and daring feats. During the Gettysburg campaign, Stuart's overly ambitious reconnaissance put him out of communication with the main army at what proved to be a critical moment. He never let down his vigilance afterward or gave his chief anxious moments of silence about the enemy again. In May 1864, Stuart died from wounds suffered in a clash with Union forces at Yellow Tavern, near Richmond."
43561,"This familiar image of Abraham Lincoln, a version of which appears on the copper penny, is easily the most ubiquitous of all Lincoln images. William Willard based this portrait on a photograph taken by Anthony Berger at Mathew Brady's studio in Washington, D.C., on February 9, 1864. The sitting occurred three weeks prior to Lincoln's appointment of General Ulysses S. Grant as commander of all the Union armies. The Lincoln penny was first minted in 1909, on the one-hundredth anniversary of Lincoln's birth."
43597,"In 1924, when Charles Sheeler drew this self-portrait, an exhibition at the Whitney Studio Club called attention to his enigmatic realism. Critics admired what Sheeler's friend, poet William Carlos Williams, later called the ""bewildering directness of his vision, without blur."" Although the portrait appears at first more conventional than the painted still lifes, cityscapes, and industrial landscapes Sheeler preferred, it shares many of their characteristics, revealing what he called ""the absolute beauty [of] . . . objects suspended in a vacuum."" The pastel also parallels Sheeler's approach to photography, particularly in the strong, artificial lighting that throws the head into sharp relief, casting abstract patterns of light and shadow. Sheeler understood, Williams wrote, that through the camera ""his subject [could] be intensified, carved out, illuminated."" A similar heightened reality enhances his self-portrayal with its intensely focused, melancholy gaze."
43755,"Rising through the ranks from midshipman to commodore, Matthew C. Perry laid the foundation for a professionally trained, technologically superior U.S. Navy that could hold its own throughout the world. Perry's greatest achievement came in 1854 when, on a mission for the United States government, he personally negotiated a treaty with Japan that established diplomatic and trade relations between that nation and the United States for the first time. Perry's success in obtaining American access to a country that had effectively sealed itself off from foreign contact for several centuries marked a significant turning point in East-West relations."

The South had no comparable news organ until September 1862, when E. W. Ayres and W. H. Wade of Richmond began publishing the Southern Illustrated News. Because paper, ink, and printing presses were just a few of the South’s many scarcities, editors scrambled to produce weekly editions of the paper. Foremost was the challenge of finding good engravers to carve the illustrations into blocks of wood, which were then inked and printed on paper. The news pages on display here represent the papers of Ayres and Wade, and Frank Leslie.  General Robert E. Lee in the Southern Illustrated News, October 17, 1863"
43944,"Born Des Moines, Iowa    Gertrude Käsebier, one of the founding members of the Photo-Secession and the first photographer to be profiled in Alfred Stieglitz’s Camera Work, earned a reputation at the turn of the twentieth century for reimagining the creative possibilities of portrait photography. Käsebier trained to be a painter at Brooklyn’s Pratt Institute but decided to pursue photography instead. Although she was married with three children, she opened a professional studio in Manhattan, where she soon attracted many of the day’s leading artistic and literary celebrities. Refusing to use the painted backdrops and contrived poses that many portrait photographers employed, Käsebier adapted lessons from her study of modern art to craft portraits that were rich in character and psychological insight."
43955,"Thirty-fourth President, 1953-61    The sense of prosperity and national serenity that exudes from this 1955 cover portrait of Dwight D. Eisenhower was the visual summation of the feature cover story. After seeing the cover, reading the article was almost unnecessary. During the twenty-nine months Eisenhower had been president, Time reported, America had settled into a period marked by low inflation, high employment, rising capital investment, and a bullish stock market. The nation's health could not have been better, and the magazine saw Eisenhower's conservative presidential leadership as a catalyst for the good times. Time's glowing assessment of Eisenhower's performance was largely based on reality, yet it also reflected the views of the magazine's founder, Henry Luce, an ardent Eisenhower supporter who did not hesitate to foster a pro-Ike slant.

43956,"In the first rank of American composers, Duke Ellington was-to use a favorite phrase of his own-""beyond category."" He produced what has been called the ""single most impressive body of composition in American jazz"": more than two thousand compositions that ranged from such popular classics as ""Satin Doll"" and ""Sophisticated Lady"" to extended works such as Black, Brown and Beige, which premiered at Carnegie Hall in 1943. Ellington continually expanded his work as a composer and bandleader, composing for Broadway (Beggar's Opera) and Hollywood (including the film score for Anatomy of a Murder); undertaking extensive international tours; and working with younger jazz musicians such as John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, and Max Roach. He received the 1965 Pulitzer Prize for his long-term achievement and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969."

Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
44077,"In 1955 Althea Gibson almost retired from tennis. Had she done so, she would have denied herself her greatest moments. Two years later, Gibson, who started her career playing paddle tennis in New York's Harlem neighborhood, was claiming both the British and United States singles titles. Clearly, at age thirty she was at the top of her game, and she remained there the following year when she repeated her British and American triumphs.   When Gibson posed for this photograph in 1957 back on her home turf in Harlem, tennis was not a great sporting interest in African American communities. As she reached the top ranks of tennis in 1957, however, that began to change, at least for awhile. As one of her fans recalled years later, ""everyone went out and bought a new racquet."""
44086,"The May 26, 1860, edition of Harper’s Weekly included a biography of Abraham Lincoln, who had just won the Republican Party’s nomination for president. The national convention had opened on May 16 in Chicago, a plus for the Illinois-raised Lincoln, but the frontrunner was William Seward of New York. Seward, however, had weakened his chances among moderate Republicans with his former antislavery radicalism. Lincoln’s less-adamant position—opposing only the extension of slavery into the territories—was viewed as giving him strength in the ""battleground"" states of the lower North, which the Republicans had lost in the 1856 election. There were 465 delegates packed into the Chicago convention hall. Seward won on the first two ballots, with Lincoln coming in second. On the third ballot, four Ohioans switched their votes to Lincoln, followed by a wild stampede of delegates for the ""rail splitter."""

The treaty made Jordan the second Arab country, after Egypt, to recognize the State of Israel. The Clinton administration brokered the treaty as part of its diplomatic effort to generate an atmosphere of coexistence between the different parties in the Middle East, including the Palestinian Liberation Organization. A preliminary agreement was reached in Washington on July 25 between Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin, and Jordan's King Hussein for an ""end to bloodshed and sorrow, and by October, the treaty was ready to be signed at Arabah, a southern border crossing between the two countries.

44303,"Carl Wimar aspired to establish a reputation as the painter of the American West. Immigrating to St. Louis in 1844, Wimar became interested at an early age in the region's history and Native peoples. He apprenticed with a local house and steamboat painter before deciding to pursue academic study in Düsseldorf, Germany, with artist Emanuel Leutze. Returning to St. Louis in 1856, Wimar began to make regular sketching trips out onto the frontier to better understand the subject he longed to paint. His canvases tended to perpetuate mythic ideas about the West and the Native Americans who lived there, yet he was one of the earliest painters to devote himself exclusively to this subject. Wimar's paintings attracted favorable comment, and in 1861 he was commissioned to create four murals to decorate the dome of the new St. Louis Courthouse. Wimar completed the series but died of tuberculosis shortly thereafter at age thirty-four."
44385,"Andrew Jackson of Tennessee was a military hero of backcountry origins. He was the seventh president, but the first to truly identify with the common people, who overwhelmingly voted him into office in 1828 and 1832. Yet many in the eastern establishment viewed his frequent use of the veto as high-handedness and an affront to wealth and privilege, and Jackson became the subject of ridicule in the partisan press. Never before had a president been so lampooned by graphic artists.   This lifelike drawing by Edward Williams Clay may have been used as a source for Clay's caustic caricatures of Jackson."
44387,"Born Jacksonville, Florida  James Weldon Johnson was a Renaissance man: successful Broadway lyricist, poet, novelist, diplomat, and a key figure in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In 1900 he collaborated with his brother John to produce ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" a song that later acquired the subtitle of the ""Negro National Anthem."" President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Johnson consul to Venezuela and Nicaragua, where he served with great distinction. In the 1920s, Johnson became a key figure in the ""New Negro"" movement and the Harlem Renaissance, known for his anthology, The Book of American Negro Poetry; his work on African American religion, God’s Trombones; and Black Manhattan, the first history of African Americans in New York City. As chief operating officer of the NAACP during that same decade, he helped formulate the strategy that would later overturn American segregation laws."
44446,"After the war, Lee stayed out of partisan politics and kept silent on the major issues of Reconstruction. Needing money, he became president of Washington College (later Washington and Lee University). His stance of dignified forbearance contributed to his becoming an iconic and beloved figure in the South.

While the precise circumstances surrounding the creation of this work are unknown, presumably the young painter Eulabee Dix and Chief Thundercloud interacted while he was modeling in New York and she was studying at the Art Students League around 1900–1902. Dix was learning to paint on ivory at the time, and this vibrantly colored likeness was probably one of the first miniatures she completed in that medium. "
44506,"At the height of his fame, Bill (""Bojangles"") Robinson was considered the greatest tap dancer in the world. With his smooth dancing style and ebullient vitality, Robinson worked his way up to the national vaudeville circuit, the Broadway stage, radio, and major studio films, breaching racial barriers all along the way. In 1939, he opened in The Hot Mikado, a swing version of the operetta. The ""agile Bill Robinson turns on the heat,"" the New York Herald Tribune proclaimed in its review. In Al Hirschfeld's accompanying illustration, the white arcs of the seats beneath the dancer's tapping feet add a percussive rhythm. Other elements of the picture seem cinematic, suggesting a lighted screen, close-ups, and long shots. In this virtuoso drawing, Hirschfeld employs squiggles, loops, arcs, thin threads of ink, and white and black stripes for different effects."
44525,"Born East St. Louis, Missouri    As a child Jacqueline Joyner was inspired by a television drama about a great sports star of the 1930s, Babe Didrikson Zaharias, to become a track and field competitor. She would eventually rival her role model as America's greatest woman athlete. Specializing in the long jump and heptathlon as a student at UCLA, where she also starred on the basketball team, she won her first Olympic medal in 1984 with a silver in the heptathlon. She went on to compete until 2000, dominating her events and winning three Olympic gold medals as well as multiple world track championships. She still holds the world record for the heptathlon, set at the Seoul Olympics of 1988, and Sports Illustrated has named her the Greatest Female Athlete of the twentieth century, just edging out Zaharias. She married her track coach, Bob Kersee, in 1986. "

After Nation's first marriage broke up because of her husband's alcoholism, she remarried and settled in Kansas, a state that had banned liquor sales in 1880. Concerned that prohibition was only lightly enforced, she founded a local chapter of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union and began a campaign for more vigorous prosecution of state liquor laws. When moral suasion failed to curb illegal activity, she turned first to public demonstrations and later to outright vandalism against offending saloons. Most famously, Nation stormed into barrooms wielding a hatchet that she used to break bottles and disrupt business. Often arrested and fined, she attracted national attention to the temperance cause."
44647,"Published between 1834 and 1874, George Bancroft's ten-volume History of the United States established its author as the undisputed ""Father of American History."" The celebratory tone of Bancroft's epic narrative reflected his firm belief in America's democratic ideals and his conviction that the historian's work should serve a high moral purpose. Bancroft's writings earned him favor with Jacksonian democrats and propelled his rise to prominence within the Democratic Party.  Appointed secretary of the navy by President James K. Polk in 1845, Bancroft was chosen by Polk a year later to serve as United States minister to the Court of St. James's in London.  "
44664,"Best known for his novel All the King’s Men (1946), Robert Penn Warren always considered himself first and foremost a poet. Born in Kentucky, ""Red"" Warren was the only one of the group of the anti-modernist and conservative southern writers known as the Agrarians who managed to escape the trap of race and racism. In fact, he became a progressive on issues of civil rights and repudiated earlier opinions that he found noxious. His ability to make this ideological transcendence while remaining rooted in the South allowed him to become one of the most prolific and consistently inventive writers in twentieth-century America. He remained conservative, both in his adherence to formal structures and the craft of writing, but also because he believed in sin and the fall of humankind. In addition to his literary work, Warren was a powerful critic, authoring the important Understanding Poetry (1938) with his friend Cleanth Brooks."
44668,"Born Charlestown, Massachusetts    Samuel Morse, inventor of the telegraph, was first an artist who helped found the National Academy of Design (1826) in order to elevate and support the arts. But around 1832 he became fascinated with the idea of sending messages via electric wire. With no scientific or mechanical training, Morse devised an elegant machine that sent coded messages by opening and closing an electrical circuit. Although the government neglected the telegraph, private businesses seized on the new invention as a great leap forward in communications technology. At a time when railways and water transportation were binding the country together, Morse did the same with a network of instantaneous communication. Speed has always characterized America, and Morse’s breakthrough was the gigantic first step in creating ever-faster means of communicating."
44841,"The first two decades of the twentieth century had been marked by American involvement in a world war and a host of progressive reforms in the country's economic and social institutions. By 1920, voters wanted a rest from all this change and ferment and were ready for a brand of White House leadership that did not threaten the status quo. In Warren G. Harding, that year's Republican presidential candidate, they found what they wanted. A convivial onetime newspaper editor, Harding made ""normalcy"" the keynote of his campaign. Although the meaning of the newly coined term was uncertain, it at least promised no unsettling changes.  Harding's administration was marked by scandals. A trusting individual, he appointed cronies to his administration who proved all too ready to use their offices for private gain. Harding, however, escaped having to face the corrupt behavior of his appointees. Just as stories of their wrongdoing were coming to light, he collapsed and died.  "
44868,"Born Twin Falls, Idaho  A career FBI agent, Mark Felt is the answer to one of the longest running questions in recent American politics: who was ""Deep Throat,"" the key source for Washington Post local reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein in their coverage of the Watergate scandal. Woodward and Bernstein’s investigation into the burglary of the Democratic Party’s offices at the Watergate hotel in August 1972 took on national importance as they uncovered the depth of the Nixon White House’s involvement in instigating and covering up the break-in. At key points, the reporters relied on the guidance of a highly placed source they called ""Deep Throat,"" after the 1970s porn film, who spoke only on deep background and not for direct attribution.

The Wild Bunch, also known as the ""Hole in the Wall Gang,"" had a varied membership; however, its most notorious members are shown in this group portrait. The heist of the Nevada bank was one of their most successful robberies and one of their final jaunts as a group. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid later escaped to South America, where they continued their life of crime.   The Wild Bunch's brazen robberies and repeated escapes from law enforcement made them  famous in their day. Since then, Hollywood has transformed this group of outlaws into mythic American icons. "

Over the previous twelve months, the men had initiated a dialogue with Communist China and fostered better relations with the Soviet Union. As a result of their diplomacy, the world was witnessing what Time described as ""the most profound rearrangement"" in international politics since World War II.

Former Alabama star quarterback Joe Namath launched his professional football career in 1965 by sparking a bidding war between teams in the upstart American Football League (AFL) and the dominant National Football League (NFL). When the AFL's struggling New York Jets won Namath's services with a three-year contract for an unprecedented $427,000, many questioned whether any player was worth such a sum. By mid-season, however, the brash young man with the ""bazooka arm"" and the lightning-quick release was the Jets' starting quarterback, and the doubters fell silent. His greatest success came in 1969 when, after declaring he could ""guarantee"" victory, Namath led the underdog Jets to a stunning Super Bowl upset of the NFL's Baltimore Colts. By combining gridiron dazzle with plenty of off-the-field flash, ""Broadway Joe"" became pro football's first mega-celebrity quarterback. "

He first achieved acclaim as a lyricist, composing with his brother ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" a work that later became known as the ""Negro National Anthem."" As a poet, journalist, and editor, Johnson contributed to and encouraged the growth of the ""New Negro"" movement, a renaissance in African American cultural expression. His novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man explored the phenomenon of ""passing"" with a remarkable degree of insight and poignancy. Johnson's contributions were not limited to the literary arena, however. He served as a United States diplomat, first in Venezuela and later in Nicaragua, and in 1917 joined the staff of the NAACP. By 1920 he served as that organization's chief executive and helped make the NAACP a national leader in civil rights activism.  "

He never lost his interest in the arts or the southern cause. Like his younger brother, Frederick, he turned to sculpting, working in woods and metals. A silver relief he made and dedicated to the ""Brave Women of the South"" was presented to Richmond’s Museum of the Confederacy in 1909. The National Portrait Gallery acquired this tin relief self-portrait in 1972."
45309,"Andrew Jackson fought in the American Revolution at age thirteen, scarred from a beating by a British officer. His ""Old Hickory"" moniker derived from an episode early in the War of 1812, when Jackson, commanding the Tennessee militia, was ordered by the governor to disband his army 500 miles from home. With 150 of his men too sick to march, Jackson ordered his officers to give up their horses, declaring, ""Not a man, sir, must be left behind,"" as he handed over his horse. From that point on, to his men, he was as unyielding as a hickory stick."

Like P. T. Barnum before him, Ziegfeld understood the pulse of popular culture and had the promotional wizardry to capitalize on it. But unlike Barnum, Ziegfeld came to the fore when the entertainment industry was no longer a small-scale venture but a national commercial phenomenon.

One was the inauguration of Jefferson Davis as the provisional president of the Confederate States of America at the state capitol in Montgomery, Alabama, on February 18, 1861. Others included the secession of South Carolina in December 1860; the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter in April 1861, which triggered President Lincoln’s immediate call for 75,000 troops to protect the nation’s capital; the Union occupation of northern Virginia in late May; and the first major battle at Manassas in July.  This 1878 chromolithograph, published thirteen years after the Confederacy surrendered, commemorates Davis’s inauguration and invokes the once-sunny optimism of a proud people at what they considered the birth of a new nation."
45383,"In 1950 the pitching heroics of right-hander Robin Roberts carried the Philadelphia Phillies to their first National League pennant in thirty-five years. Roberts was in his second full year in the majors when the usually lackluster Phillies made a strong bid for the league championship. But as the baseball season drew to a close, Philadelphia suddenly began to falter. With a pitching staff in disarray, it fell to Roberts to reverse the downward spiral. He started five times in the last eight days of the season and in the final game defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers in ten innings to clinch the pennant for the Phillies. In the years that followed, Roberts proved to be Philadelphia's mainstay. Posting six consecutive seasons of twenty or more victories (1950-55), Roberts's consistency and pinpoint control made him one of the era's best pitchers."
45409,"Chief Joseph came to embody for many the tragic plight of Native Americans during the second half of the nineteenth century. His resistance to government efforts to move the Nez Percé people to a reservation drew anger from U.S. authorities, but also prompted widespread sympathy from many Americans. When troops were called in to speed the removal process in 1877, Joseph and 800 of his followers began a strategic retreat, seeking safety first among allied tribes in Montana and then heading toward Canada. Only thirty miles from the border, a command led by General Nelson Miles intercepted this band and forced Joseph to surrender. For the next eight years Joseph was imprisoned at several sites, including Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. It was there that artist Cyrenius Hall created this painting of the dispirited leader.  "
45414,"Time “Man of the Year,” 1980     Throughout his political career, Ronald Reagan was often underestimated, an impression he happily used to his advantage. The editors of Time magazine, surprised by his margin of victory over Jimmy Carter in 1980, named him “Man of the Year,” but suggested that there was a “remarkably accidental air about Reagan’s career.” Time noted that he was “lucky” and that he prevailed because the nation was “deeply soured on the Carter Administration.” The magazine’s writers seemed perplexed that an “amateur politician”—a man too right-wing and too old—became president. His politics, they believed, amounted to little more than “invoking old values”; his success as the “Great Communicator” was due to his acting abilities. Reflecting on the shortcomings of recent presidents, Time feared that Reagan would encounter problems “more complex, more shadowy and more terrifying than he could manage with his hopeful and nostalgic view of America.”                  Aaron Shikler’s likeness captured the low-key temperament and sense of humor that Reagan successfully used to persuade rather than frighten voters. "
45439,"The “cracked-plate” image of Abraham Lincoln, taken by Alexander Gardner on February 5, 1865, is one of the most important and evocative photographs in American history. In preparing for his second inaugural, Lincoln had a series of photographs taken at Gardner’s studio. During this sitting, Gardner created this portrait by accident: at some point, possibly when the glass-plate negative was heated to receive a coat of varnish, a crack appeared in the upper half of the plate. Gardner pulled a single print and then discarded the plate, so only one such portrait exists.  The portrait represents a radical departure from Gardner’s usual crisp empiricism. The shallow depth of field created when Gardner moved his camera in for a close-up yielded a photograph whose focus is confined to the plane of Lincoln’s cheeks, while the remainder of the image appears diffused and even out of focus. Lincoln is careworn and tired, his face grooved by the emotional shocks of war. Yet his face also bears a small smile, perhaps as he contemplates the successful conclusion of hostilities and the restoration of the Union. This is Lincoln between life and death, between his role as a historical actor and the mystical figure that he would become with his assassination. Although Lincoln looked forward to his second term, we know, as he could not, that he will soon be assassinated. This image inextricably links history and myth, creating one of the most powerful American portraits."

45572,"Ordained a Catholic priest in 1861 and made a cardinal in 1887, James Gibbons was one of the most influential clerics of his day. While ""he reigned in Baltimore like a king,"" a British admirer once wrote, ""he met every man like a comrade."" Gibbons's success in preventing papal condemnation of Catholic laborers participating in the Knights of Labor's struggle for improved working conditions was characteristic of his commitment to the working man. He was also instrumental in maintaining unity in an increasingly diverse American Catholic Church by promoting the acculturation of its foreign-born membership. A friend to several presidents, Gibbons was often called on for counsel on issues ranging from tariff policy to the acquisition of the Philippines. French artist Theobald Chartran's portrait of Gibbons captures the warmth that accounted in large part for his wide influence.  "
45629,"In 1942, the brilliant physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer was put in charge of the Manhattan Project, overseeing the development of the atomic bomb. In less than three years, his team exploded the world's first nuclear weapon. Later, Oppenheimer joined other physicists recommending against development of a more powerful hydrogen bomb, although he was not opposed to further development of nuclear weapons. Following accusations of disloyalty, he lost his security clearance, preventing him from engaging in any government sponsored nuclear research. Some believe that Oppenheimer was the target of the anti-Communist witch hunts of the early 1950s. Others point out that his leftist political sentiments in the 1930s, his failure to report approaches by Soviet agents in the 1940s, and revelations that Soviet agents had penetrated the Manhattan Project made him especially vulnerable.

45662,"Born Louisville, Kentucky  Few performers could match the versatility of actress Irene Dunne, who moved effortlessly from tear-stained melodramas to madcap comedies in a career that spanned more than forty films. A classically trained soprano, Dunne failed in her quest to join New York’s Metropolitan Opera in 1920 but found steady work on the Broadway stage before winning the part of Magnolia in the touring company of the musical Show Boat (1929). Her success in that production led to a contract with RKO Pictures and starring roles in a string of romantic tearjerkers. Dunne returned to musicals with featured roles in the film versions of Roberta (1935) and Show Boat (1936), before venturing into screwball comedy with her sparkling, Oscar-nominated performances in Theodora Goes Wild (1936) and The Awful Truth (1937). Also nominated for her work in Love Affair (1939) and I Remember Mama (1948), Dunne never took home an Oscar but remained a Hollywood favorite."

In 1925 he accepted the challenge of organizing the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters-the first black labor union chartered by the American Federation of Labor. Continuing his advocacy for African American workers, Randolph called for a march on Washington in 1941 to protest the exclusion of blacks from defense industry jobs. He cancelled that march only after President Franklin Roosevelt signed an order mandating an end to discriminatory practices by government contractors. Following World War II, Randolph led the effort to desegregate the nation's armed forces, and waged a civil disobedience campaign against the draft until President Harry Truman ordered an end to segregation in the military in 1948. Randolph crowned his career in 1963 by organizing the celebrated March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom."

Accompanied by Colonel Pieter Schuyler, the mayor of Albany, this delegation traveled to London hoping to strengthen the tribe's political and trading alliance with England. Since the outbreak of Queen Anne's War in 1701, the French had been regularly raiding poorly protected English settlements in upstate New York. Although the Iroquois tribes had provided the English with some military assistance, the pleas of English colonists for help in this struggle had fallen largely on deaf ears back in England. E Tow Oh Koam and his fellow delegates convinced Queen Anne to commit the resources to help defend the contested border, thereby hastening the war's end and formalizing an alliance that endured throughout much of the eighteenth century."

45774,"Since the late nineteenth century, the editorial cartoon has played a provocative role in presidential politics, countering partisan advertising with irreverence. Australian-born Pulitzer-Prize winner Pat Oliphant (born 1935) hones a distinctive, repeatable caricature of each incoming president. When each fails to live up to expectations, those exaggerated figures begin to age, sag, shrink, weaken, or bloat. Oliphant has summarized his cartoon depictions of each president since Lyndon Johnson in a series of bronze sculptures. His images of Richard Nixon as a haunting and malevolent Napoleon, Gerald Ford as Band-Aided hollow mask, Jimmy Carter as an insignificant miniature, and George H. W. Bush as a wizened horseshoe player, remind us of the powerful impact of satiric portraiture.  "
45849,"Born Louisville, Kentucky  Few American boxers have possessed athletic talents comparable to those of Muhammad Ali, nor could many equal him for charisma and bravado. Turning professional after a gold medal win at the 1960 Olympics, Ali (born Cassius Clay) attained the heavyweight crown in 1964. His skill, along with his words and actions outside the ring—including outrageous boasts in poetic verse—won him a huge international following. However, controversy ensued when he joined the Nation of Islam and refused to serve in Vietnam, and he was stripped of his title. After being reinstated, Ali would reclaim the heavyweight crown, lose it, and regain it again before retiring in 1981. Ali was an ideal subject for one of Andy Warhol’s explorations of fame. But instead of showing the shallow surface of mass media–driven consumer culture, Warhol depicted Ali in an unexpectedly quiet, introspective pose. "
45923,"Born Galveston, Texas     This German poster portrays Jack Johnson, the first black world heavyweight boxing champion, as a dignified athlete of magnificent physique. Advertising a film of his 1910 fight with Jim Jeffries, the image avoids the controversies the bout caused in the United States. Social reformers, who viewed the sport as barbaric, were successful in moving the event from San Francisco to Reno. The match, pitting “the Negroes’ Deliverer” against the “Hope of the White Race,” engendered bitter racial overtones. Upsetting notions of white racial superiority, Johnson’s decisive victory caused race riots around the country, and the film was banned in many American cities. Without reference to such tensions, this image shows an angular, honed Johnson, almost machine-like in power and precision. Produced by a Hamburg company known for its circus advertising, this poster heralds the emergence of sporting events as a major entertainment industry in twentieth-century global culture. "
45965,"This group portrait by Life magazine photographer Gjon Mili pictures Count Basie (lower right, in front of the piano) and other members of his band, including celebrated saxophonist Lester Young (center, with black hat). Influenced by the piano styles of Willie ""the Lion"" Smith and Fats Waller, Basie formed his first group in 1935. For the next forty years, Basie performed and recorded with a frequency unmatched by any other big band. In addition to routinely crisscrossing the United States, he led thirty European tours and traveled eight times across the Pacific Ocean to entertain audiences. In 1961 he gave a memorable performance at President John F. Kennedy's inauguration, solidifying his national reputation. Basie's ability to adapt to changing musical tastes, while maintaining the group's artistic integrity, was a hallmark of this extraordinary jazz orchestra."
45978,"Herbert Hoover seemed to be the ultimate problem-solver. As a mining engineer, he had turned marginal operations into thriving enterprises. During World War I, his administration of European food relief was nothing short of brilliant. As secretary of commerce in the 1920s, he transformed a once-sleepy department into a purposeful information clearinghouse. Yet as the Great Depression took hold during the second year of his presidency, Hoover was hard pressed for a solution. Believing in the power of private initiative, he hesitated to initiate federal involvement to revive business. When lengthening bread lines and escalating joblessness finally convinced him of the necessity of such steps, the measures proved inadequate. As a result, Hoover's 1932 reelection bid met with crushing defeat   When president-elect Hoover posed confidently for Steichen's camera, the devastating stock market crash that would doom his presidency lay less than a year away."
45981,"William F. Cody did arguably more than any single individual to popularize the myth of the American West. Before achieving international fame as a showman, he worked a variety of short-term jobs, including serving as a Pony Express rider, an army scout, and a hunting guide. Nicknamed ""Buffalo Bill"" because of his prowess in hunting buffalo, Cody entered the world of entertainment after a dime novelist in New York wrote a story about his exploits in the West. A subsequent offer to appear on stage led first to a theatrical career and ultimately to the creation in 1883 of his touring Buffalo Bill's Wild West show. For the next thirty years he was the centerpiece of this wildly popular display that combined rodeo and historical reenactment. This photograph was created in 1887, the year Cody first toured his wild west show in Europe."
46033,"Erskine Caldwell produced more than fifty books in the course of his long writing career, but he is best remembered for only two, Tobacco Road and God's Little Acre. Both published in the early 1930s, these two novels focused on the most impoverished segment of rural life in Caldwell's native Georgia, and in them, he depicted that world with a raw and earthy frankness that many found offensive. Others, however, applauded his candor and embraced him as a spokesman of the downtrodden.  Caldwell's portrayal of southern rural poverty doubtless fed the Depression era's impulse to try to address that problem. But Caldwell always claimed that when he sat down to write, social change was not his goal. ""I was never trying to prove anything,"" he said in 1982. ""I was only trying to tell a story."""
46038,"By 1867, Whitman's major work as a poet was done. After the death of Abraham Lincoln, he completed his book of war poems, Drum Taps. Whitman's remaining years would be spent re-editing Leaves of Grass, writing prose, and cultivating his reputation throughout the world. He began giving an annual lecture on Lincoln's death, a lecture that drew on the eyewitness testimony of his companion Peter Doyle, who was in Ford's Theatre when Lincoln was assassinated.  "
46071,"Davidson made portraits of journalist and playwright Clare Boothe Luce and her husband Henry R. Luce (founder of Time magazine) at their South Carolina estate. Her portrait was polychromed, a technique which interested Davidson, who later wrote: ""I had installed a kiln in my studio in Paris, so that I could fire my own terra-cottas. I finally found an amalgam (a mixture of clays) which, when fired, produced the basic color I was after, a warm vibrant flesh tint."" He added the watercolor tones before firing ""to accentuate the life quality of the portrait bust."""
46083,"Historians view the four-way 1912 election as one of the most interesting in American history. Former president Theodore Roosevelt formed his Bull Moose Party and ran on ""New Nationalism,"" a program of government regulation of corporations. Eugene Debs ran as a socialist candidate; President William Howard Taft ran for reelection as the Republican candidate. Woodrow Wilson, the Democratic Party nominee, ran on a reform platform known as the ""New Freedom,"" which pledged to break up concentrations of wealth and power and restore competiveness to the economy. "
46112,"As a younger man, Lee had impressed his classmates at West Point for his maturity and gravitas, who described him as the “Marble Model” for the ideal soldier. Lee’s good looks were also widely remarked on, as were his manners. His reserve and perfect decorum—he was rarely visibly angry with others—only deepened as his responsibilities grew, first for his family and then for his army. Lee’s great biographer, Douglass Southall Freeman, ascribed no mystery to Lee; he was exactly as he seemed: a perfect, Christian gentleman and soldier. Modern biographers have disagreed, finding contradictions between the inner and outer man as Lee coped with his emotional conflicts. Perhaps the “real” Lee can never be known. As South Carolina diarist Mary Chesnut wondered, “Can anybody say they know [him]? I doubt it. He looks so cold and quiet and grand.”   Robert E. Lee     En su juventud, Lee impresionó a sus compañeros de clase en West Point por su madurez y seriedad; lo describieron como el ""modelo de mármol"" del soldado ideal. También se comentaba abiertamente sobre la buena apariencia de Lee y sobre sus modales. Su reserva y perfecto decoro —raramente se mostraba visiblemente enojado con los demás— sólo se profundizó a medida que crecían sus responsabilidades, primero por su familia y luego por su ejército. El gran biógrafo de Lee, Douglass Southall Freeman, no le atribuyó ningún misterio; era exactamente lo que aparentaba ser: un soldado y un caballero perfecto y cristiano. Los biógrafos modernos han discrepado al encontrar contradicciones entre el hombre interior y exterior cuando Lee afrontaba sus conflictos emocionales. Quizás nunca se podrá conocer al Lee “real”. Como se preguntaba la diarista de Carolina del Sur, Mary Chesnut, ""¿alguno puede decir que lo conoce?"". Lo dudo. Parecía tan frío y tranquilo e importante”.      Paul Giradet (1821–1893), en el estilo de Minnis & Cowell  Gravado, c. 1865  National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution"
46192,"Born Tokyo, Japan  Growing up in Japan, Michio Ito was trained in traditional Noh theater. When he traveled to Paris in 1911 and saw both Isadora Duncan and Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes, his interest in dance was sparked.  By 1916 he was creating choreography that combined Eastern techniques with Western movement, music, lighting, and costuming. He immigrated to New York and eventually formed a troupe of six dancers that toured the country. Landing in Hollywood in 1929, he created “symphonic choreographies” that were performed in such outdoor spaces as the Hollywood Bowl; he also contributed to six movies, including Madame Butterfly (1933).  After Pearl Harbor was bombed, Ito was interned in New Mexico until 1943, when he repatriated to Japan as part of a prisoner exchange. After the war, he choreographed revues for American occupation troops at the Ernie Pyle Theatre in Tokyo."
46196,"No golfer to date has come close to matching Jack Nicklaus's towering record of tournament victories. Nicknamed the ""Golden Bear"" for his blonde hair and stocky build, Nicklaus combined superb athletic talent with keen strategic ability and phenomenal powers of concentration to prevail in twenty major championships between 1959 and 1986. Named Rookie of the Year in 1962, Nicklaus kicked off his pro career with several dramatic wins, including his upset of favorite Arnold Palmer at the U.S. Open. In the years that followed, his tally included three more U.S. Open titles, along with five PGA championships, three British Open crowns, and an unprecedented six Masters trophies, the last of which he captured by a single stroke at the age of forty-six. That triumph prompted the New York Times to declare that Nicklaus was ""the best player of his time."""
46243,"Roberto Clemente was born in Puerto Rico, but became a legend in Pittsburgh, where he played his entire eighteen-year major league baseball career. One of baseball's premier hitters, Clemente was also a twelve-time winner of the Gold Glove for his excellence in the outfield. As a Latino, Clemente endured the same hardships and stereotypes as African American ballplayers of the time. He used every opportunity to fight discrimination on and off the field and was determined to better the lives of marginalized people: ""Any time you have the opportunity to make a difference in this world and you don't do it, you are wasting your time on this earth."" Clemente was killed in an airplane crash on December 31, 1972, attempting to deliver relief supplies to earthquake victims in Managua, Nicaragua."
46266,"  When asked how to become a better artist, Raphael Soyer said, ""Draw, draw, draw."" During his youth in Russia, his father taught him to draw and encouraged him to take life drawing classes once the family moved to New York. Soyer sketched constantly, drawing people he met on the streets and his own reflection in the mirror. ""I've painted and drawn myself countless times because, frankly, I am an introvert and introverts are involved with themselves."" He also used self-portraiture to emulate some of his artistic heroes, serial self-portraitists such as Rembrandt, Corot, and Degas. He enjoyed manipulating the image in order to contemplate his life, past and future. In this work he looks older than his twenty-something years, but his drawings made toward the end of his life celebrate his youth and vitality.  "
46296,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
46319,"Most written accounts of Robert E. Lee’s surrender to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox on April 9, 1865, noted the difference between Lee’s stiff dignity and Grant’s more relaxed demeanor. This lithograph of the event, showing the two men as they waited for the peace terms to be copied, captures that difference better than most.  After the surrender, Wilmer McLean, the owner of the house, lost much of his furniture to soldiers desiring mementos of the historic event. Later, in what proved to be a futile effort to recoup his losses and raise funds for his needy family, he commissioned this print."
46320,"The resources of the agricultural South by and large were scarce compared to the ample supplies of goods enjoyed in the industrial North. The South had less of everything, from table salt to weapons, as depicted in this sketch. A clergyman offers up the bells from his church, seen in the background, to a Confederate officer so that the metal, preferably bronze, could be cast into cannons. As seen in the lower left corner, the townspeople also donated andirons, kettles, and candlesticks to the southern cause."
46323,"Born Hillsboro, West Virginia  The greatest influence on writer Pearl Buck’s career was the time she spent in China, first as a child with her missionary parents and later with her husband. The experiences of more than thirty years’ residence in that country served as subject-matter for her best work, including her second novel, The Good Earth, which became an instant best-seller at its publication in 1931 and won a Pulitzer Prize. Her subsequent fictional explorations of China also drew much attention and praise. Yet it was the pair of biographies of her parents—The Exile and Fighting Angel—that were decisive in her being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938. The author of more than seventy books, Buck engaged in a variety of humanitarian endeavors, placing particular emphasis on fostering better understanding between East and West. "
46410,"In July 1849, the Albany Morning Express reported the publication of a lithographic portrait of Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre ""executed by Messrs. D’Avignon and Hoffman, N.Y. from a daguerreotype picture taken from life of this great artist at his chateau [in] Brie [sic] Sur Marne, France, by the Meade Brothers of Albany, N.Y., one of whom visited Europe last year on a professional tour."" The brothers were obviously pleased with this lithograph, for when Daguerre died in July 1851, their condolence message to his widow included an offer to send her one of the prints. Thanking the brothers for their ""kind and sympathizing letter,"" Madame Daguerre replied that she did not possess the lithograph, adding, ""It would indeed be a great treasure to me to have one."" The print was sent, and when Henry Meade visited Madame Daguerre in 1853, he was pleased to see it on her wall."
46429,"Born Brookville, Indiana     A practicing lawyer in Indiana at the start of the Civil War, Lew Wallace volunteered his services to the Union cause and rose to the rank of major general. In July 1864, he commanded the federal forces that deterred Confederates under General Jubal Early from encroaching upon the U.S. capital. At war’s end he represented the government at the court-martials of the Lincoln assassination conspirators, as well as that of Henry Wirz, the commander of the Union prison camp at Andersonville, Georgia.               Wallace, however, is best remembered as the author of Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1880), which was one of the best-selling novels of the nineteenth century. The book has never gone out of print and has inspired two movie versions, the last in 1959 featuring Charlton Heston as Ben Hur."
46443,"Time’s 1981 cover story, “AWACS—He Does It Again,” noted that the president had won Senate approval for sending radar planes to Saudi Arabia and went on to discuss his first-year legislative victories. Reagan’s priority was restoring an economy then viewed as the worst since the Great Depression, which baffled economists because of simultaneous recession and inflation. His program—reductions in taxes, regulations, and spending—had to pass the Democratic Congress and survive a classic struggle between a conservative president and a powerful, liberal Speaker of the House, Thomas P. (“Tip”) O’Neill. O’Neill dismissed Reagan’s prior relationship with a Democratic California legislature as “minor league.” Their first-name basis and swapping of Irish jokes papered over their intense battles. Reagan was only able to reduce the rate of increase in federal spending, and his first budget in January 1982 projected a deficit of $91.5 billion. But with support from sixty-three Democrats, he won a substantial, across-the-board decrease in income taxes.   "
46454,"The reserved Frances Perkins spoke in a quiet, genteel accent. Nevertheless, as Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of labor and the first woman ever to serve in a cabinet post, she managed to hold her own among FDR's dynamic New Dealers. Under her leadership, the Department of Labor became more influential than it had ever been. Among the most personally satisfying moments of her twelve-year tenure was the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. Included in that watershed law was a ban on child labor and a provision for a minimum wage, measures that Perkins had advocated ever since her early days as a labor reformer in New York.  Clara Sipprell's likeness shows Perkins wearing the pearl necklace that was part of her signature garb. Not present, however, is the three-cornered hat that was her most reliable sartorial trademark during her tenure at Labor."
46486,"The partisan ballyhoo of prints, cartoons, song sheets, and broadsides was particularly effective during the raucous electioneering of the 1840 presidential campaign. In this broadside promoting William Henry Harrison, the log cabin title and cider barrel border helped transform the college-educated Whig candidate into a champion of the common man. These symbols of frontier struggles and simple tastes came from a newspaper's sneering comment that Harrison, if given a pension and a barrel of hard cider, would be content to retire to his log cabin. Whig campaigners seized upon the imagery, enlivening mass rallies with free cider, new campaign songs, and log cabin pictures. The lower and middle classes had suffered keenly after the panic of 1837, and populist symbols, slogans, and tunes helped Harrison's cause. On all their banners, one Whig noted approvingly, ""the Temple of Liberty is transformed into a hovel of unhewn logs.""  "
46534,"Clergyman Henry Highland Garnet was well acquainted with the evils of America's ""peculiar institution."" Born in slavery in Maryland, he escaped from bondage in 1824 and later served as a conductor on the Underground Railroad in Troy, New York. Like many abolitionists, Garnet first hoped that moral persuasion could turn public opinion against slavery, but in 1840 he abandoned this approach in favor of political action. His stance became still more militant in 1843, when he delivered an impassioned speech at the National Convention of Colored Citizens in Buffalo, New York. In his ""Address to the Slaves of the United States of America,"" Garnet exhorted those in bondage to rise in insurrection against their enslavers. ""Strike for your lives and liberties,"" he proclaimed. ""Rather die freemen than live to be slaves. . . . Let your motto be resistance! Resistance! RESISTANCE!"""
46605,"Few individuals have managed to harness the forces of American politics better than Lyndon Johnson. Thus, when he surrendered his position as Senate majority leader to become John Kennedy's vice president in 1961, it was inevitable that he should bridle at the political limbo of his new office.  But when Johnson became president upon Kennedy's assassination, his ability to get what he wanted was soon yielding a string of landmark legislation that included a far-reaching civil rights act and a federally funded ""war on poverty."" Unfortunately, escalation of the war against Communist aggression in Vietnam overshadowed those successes. By the end of his presidency, Johnson had gone from being one of the most successful presidents in history to one of the most maligned.  This portrait by Peter Hurd was meant to be Johnson's official White House likeness. But that plan was quickly scrapped after Johnson declared it ""the ugliest thing I ever saw."" Soon the pun was making the rounds in Washington that ""artists should be seen around the White House-but not Hurd.""  "
46612,"President Lincoln considered his appointment of David Glasgow Farragut as commander of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron the best one he made during the Civil War. Sailing in the flagship USS Hartford on April 24, 1862, Farragut led his fleet of seventeen vessels in a successful run through the Confederate defenses, engaged and defeated the enemy ships, and captured New Orleans.  Then, on August 5, 1864, as Farragut's fleet of four ironclads and fourteen wooden vessels steamed down the narrow, torpedo-lined channel to capture Mobile Bay, the ironclad Tecumseh struck a mine and sank. Shouting ""Damn the torpedoes!"" Farragut forged ahead of the hesitant fleet. The Confederate warships were dispersed, and by month's end the harbor defenses had surrendered. This was the major victory of Farragut's naval career and earned him the rank of vice admiral.  "
46631,"A gifted pianist and singer who moved easily between jazz and the classics, Hazel Scott dazzled audiences with her witty, daring, and sophisticated performances. Her prodigious talent was evident at an early age. Only fifteen when she appeared as soloist with Count Basie and his orchestra in 1935, Scott made her Broadway debut just three years later. In 1940 her Carnegie Hall performance of a ""swing"" version of Liszt's Second Hungarian Rhapsody created a sensation, delighting her fans and confounding the critics. From 1939 to 1945 (the year in which she married Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr.), Scott not only enjoyed star status as a nightclub performer in New York, but also appeared in several films and toured extensively. A staunch proponent of equal rights, she maintained a professional contract enabling her to refuse to perform before racially segregated audiences.   "
46652,"Paul Colin and Le Tumulte Noir    The jazz age had taken hold in Paris and with it, le tumulte noir, an intense fascination with black culture. African sculpture had inspired such artists as Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso; African American ragtime and jazz stimulated avant-garde composers; dancers were captivated by the Cakewalk, the Black Bottom, and the Charleston. Many people perceived in non-Western art forms a ""pure"" and intuitive creative impulse, in contrast to the overrefined artifice of white European culture. African American expatriates fleeing segregation at home were welcomed.   In 1927 Paul Colin published his portfolio Le Tumulte Noir, featuring forty-five lithographs with pochoir, or stenciled, color, in an edition of 500. Colin's dynamic images were inspired by cubism and art deco modernism. Several lithographs directly evoke Baker's slim form, costumes, and energetic dancing. Others feature jazz bands, prominent white music-hall entertainers depicted as black, or amusing images of the French attempting new dances.    Le Tumulte Noir is not without racist overtones drawn from imagery prominent in American and European popular culture. Nonetheless, it does not just celebrate the ""primitive""; its tone is more admiring than condescending. "
46688,"Of those joining President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal administration in 1933, Harry Hopkins was easily the most adventuresome in devising ways to alleviate the Great Depression. This slender dynamo of a man first served as FDR's chief of a massive emergency relief for the unemployed. By 1935 he was heading the Works Progress Administration, charged with putting the nation's unemployed to work on government-funded projects. Critics accused him of careless waste. Hopkins, however, never wavered in his commitment to easing the Depression, claiming that his detractors were simply ""too . . . dumb to understand"" the importance of his work.  "
46693,"Mae West was a comedienne, playwright, actress, and sex symbol who first brought women’s desire to film. West developed her bawdy style and walk on the vaudeville circuit, in part from blueswomen and drag queens. She wrote and produced a series of controversial plays, many of which were raided by the police: Sex (about prostitutes), The Drag (about homosexuality), Pleasure Man (about burlesque), and Diamond Lil (her most enduring character). In pre–Hays Code Hollywood films, she made a young Cary Grant her straight man while invoking her famous double entendres: “When I’m good, I’m very good; but when I’m bad, I’m better.” Or: “I used to be Snow White—but I drifted.” Or—in response to a naive girl’s comment, “Goodness, what diamonds!”—”Goodness had nothing to do with it.” She recorded with Duke Ellington in the 1930s, had a popular Las Vegas stage act in the 1950s, and, at the Beatles’ request, appeared on the cover of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967)."
46711,"Notwithstanding the biblical quote from Leviticus cited in the caption of this lithograph, Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation declared freedom only to those slaves in the eleven Confederate states that had seceded. Ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment-which happened in 1865-was required to liberate slaves elsewhere throughout the Union, particularly in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware.

46729,"Born Corning, New York    As a visiting nurse among New York City's immigrants in the early 1900s, Margaret Sanger was profoundly affected by the physical and mental toll exacted on women by frequent childbirth, miscarriage, and self-induced abortion. Faced with laws forbidding dissemination of contraceptive information, Sanger's crusade had much opposition. But by 1921, when Sanger founded the Birth Control League, her movement had begun to win adherents in respectable quarters. Adding to her life of controversy is her association with the eugenics movement-which included promotion of forced sterilization for those deemed mentally unfit-a movement that for a time was endorsed by many of the era's prominent thinkers.  "
46861,"John D. Rockefeller once remarked, ""The only question with wealth is, what do you do with it?"" By 1913, Rockefeller, a founder of the Standard Oil Company, had amassed an estimated $900 million, earned from an aggressive reorganization of the oil industry, which granted his company a virtual monopoly and him a tough reputation. An emblem of self-made success, the controversial tycoon rehabilitated his reputation in later years by supporting charitable causes such as medicine, education, and the Baptist Church. Paul Manship's bust reflects the transformation, depicting Rockefeller as a generous benefactor rather than a ruthless industrialist.  "
46902,"   Born Queen Anne’s County, Maryland   Charles Willson Peale is best remembered as an artist, but he was also the proprietor of the first important museum in America, the Philadelphia Museum of art and natural history. In his mid-forties, after painting hundreds of portraits of the powerful and elite, Peale began a lifelong undertaking: the creation of a new museum designed for a republic. While science museums in Europe placed their specimens in drawers, pinned flat to white cloth, Peale’s museum, designed to involve large numbers of Americans in an educational experience, presented them to visitors in lifelike situations, labeled with their scientific names and ordered in the Linnaean classification. Anyone who could pay the twenty-five-cent admission fee could enter, unlike European institutions, which required special application. Peale also directed the first scientific expedition in America, which exhumed and assembled a mastodon skeleton, helping scientists prove the existence of prehistoric animals.   Three years after completing this self-portrait, Peale gave up portrait painting as his profession to focus on his museum. "
46914,"Born Springdale, Pennsylvania    As a government scientist, Rachel Carson became concerned about the ecological impact of pesticides, especially DDT, and in 1962 she published the groundbreaking Silent Spring. Finely written and passionately reasoned, Silent Spring exploded into national consciousness and can be said to have started the modern environmental movement. Although some of its conclusions are still controversial today, the book was a warning that an active citizenry had to be skeptical of large institutions, an attitude that became a dominant theme of the 1960s and 1970s. Sculptor Una Hanbury, who met Carson shortly before her death, was struck by her tremendous vitality and incorporated that quality into her portrait."
47010,"John D. Schiff, who frequently photographed Marcel Duchamp and documented his work, created this portrait in 1957, when Duchamp's star was on the rise in the United States. Two years earlier, Duchamp had officially become an American citizen. He would play an increasingly important role in the American art scene, participating in exhibitions, giving lectures, and exerting a strong influence on young artists. Schiff positions Duchamp in a frontal pose and under direct light, emphasizing Duchamp's facial features and highlighting the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth. The sharp contrasts of light and dark, the shadowy background, and the closely cropped composition, as well as Duchamp's penetrating gaze, compel the viewer to connect with image. While Duchamp's gaze is direct, his eyes remain shrouded in shadows, imbuing this seemingly straightforward portrait with a detached, enigmatic air. "
47123,"George Dewey obtained fame during the Spanish-American War after more than forty years of service. His slow rise through the ranks began at the Naval Academy in Annapolis. During the Civil War, Dewey performed with honor during an assault on New Orleans, earning the rank of lieutenant commander. In 1898, Commodore Dewey gained the command of the Asiatic Squadron stationed in Nagasaki Harbor. With the outbreak of war between Spain and the United States, he was ordered to engage the Spanish fleet stationed near the Philippines. On May 1, Dewey destroyed the fleet and paved the way for U.S. occupation of the islands. Upon his return, Dewey was greeted as a national hero and awarded the rank of admiral. He continued to serve the navy until his death."
47128,"The 1828 presidential campaign coincided with the beginning of the lithographic cartoon in America, which would soon become a staple of electioneering. Although Andrew Jackson won a decisive victory, the campaign was vicious. Edward W. Clay's A Grand Functionary ridicules Jackson for his vengeance against a Treasury auditor who had published anti-Jackson articles. (Clay avoids mentioning that Jackson's supposed victim had been caught embezzling funds.) Invoking Shakespeare's indictment of the misuse of power and caricaturing Jackson as a spindly legged, Dickensian misanthrope, Clay set a high standard for political satire, which would develop new energy in the newspaper editorial cartoon later in the century."
47153,"In making a portrait, one critic observed, Alice Neel ""hurls shafts that hit the mark but do not sting,"" pinpointing the penetrating yet benevolent quality in the figure studies for which she is best known. Neel adhered to portraiture in the midst of the abstract expressionist movement and was consequently ignored by the art world until shortly before two retrospective exhibitions held during the early 1970s. ""Life begins at seventy!"" she said of her career's newfound transformation.  In 1975, she began this shocking, endearing, and utterly unconventional self-portrait, which was not completed until 1980. As Neel noted, ""the reason my cheeks got so pink was that it was so hard for me to paint that I almost killed myself painting it."" A striking challenge to the centuries-old convention of idealized femininity, Neel's only painted self-portrait is wonderfully suggestive of her bohemian, bawdy character.  "
47167,"In 1852, Franklin Pierce seemed to his fellow Democrats to be an ideal choice for the presidency. A northerner with southern sympathies, Pierce could seemingly engender credibility in both regions in a year marked by continuing debate over slavery. But his willingness to listen to pro-slavery extremists served the country poorly once he was in office. The most obvious case in point was his approval of the Kansas-Nebraska Act in 1854, which allowed slaveholders to settle in an area once closed to slavery. The result was armed violence in Kansas and an escalation in hostilities between North and South. Northerners could not find words harsh enough to describe him: Ralph Waldo Emerson, for example, accused him of ""imbecility.""  George P. A. Healy derived the original version of this image from sittings that took place in Boston in November 1852, shortly after Pierce's election was confirmed. At the same time, Healy was painting for Pierce a likeness of the president-elect's campaign biographer and longtime friend Nathaniel Hawthorne."
47194,"Born Sacramento, California    Starring in three 1980s coming-of-age movies produced by John Hughes, actress Molly Ringwald is the personification of the 1980s. Ringwald first performed on stage at age three, singing at the California State Fair with her father's band backing her. By age six she had recorded an album, Molly Sings. A role in Paul Mazursky's 1982 film The Tempest garnered Ringwald a Golden Globe nomination and the attention of John Hughes, who was interested in making a movie highlighting teen angst. Hughes wrote Sixteen Candles (1984) for Ringwald and actor Michael Hall, and Ringwald worked on two additional Hughes films: The Breakfast Club (1985) and Pretty in Pink (1986). Hughes's films and Ringwald's characters defined the culture and attitudes of teens in that decade.   Photographer Theo Westenberger captured this photo of Ringwald and her signature red hair for a 1986 Time magazine cover with the headline ""Ain't She Sweet.""  "
47244,"When this photograph was taken, the president’s family was preparing to leave the White House and Roosevelt’s hand-picked successor, William Taft, was expected to become president. Immediately after his presidency, Roosevelt would travel to British East Africa (present-day Kenya). He had been planning, in conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution, a large safari to collect specimens for the national museum. Roosevelt would just be fifty, young for an ex-president but not for the formidable risks of hunting big game. He had decided to take along his nineteen-year-old bookish son Kermit (second from left), as he wanted to toughen up the fragile young man and remove him from the influence of his mother. Edith Roosevelt had reconciled herself to her husband’s craving for risk and adventure, trusting that Theodore’s seeming invincibility would protect her more vulnerable son."
47253,"This mixed-media artwork labeled The Carter Presidency appeared on Time the week of the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Artist Joan Hall recently reflected on the making of this work: ""When I was given this assignment by Time magazine, I was assigned a long list of events . . . to include. . . . I believe that an illustrator must combine good graphics with content, so it was a bit of a challenge to put so much information on one cover without it looking too cluttered. I solved this problem by making individual compartments surrounding the sculpture of Carter.""    Time cover, August 18, 1980"
47256,"American landscape painter John Marin lived in Paris from 1905 to 1911. One evening, at the Café du Dome, a spot popular with many young American artists, Davidson persuaded Marin to sit for this portrait. He later wrote, ""I induced him, after an absinthe or two, to sit for me. On the way to the studio we bought a loaf of bread, some cheese, and a bottle of wine. . . . I don't know how long we worked or when we left the studio, . . . but when I woke up the next morning, there was the bust of John Marin in clay.""   "
47322,"Poor Carl Sandburg! Evidently he thought Robert Frost, his near-contemporary and fellow avatar of American folksiness, liked him and that they were comrades in their common purpose to celebrate America’s common people. The canny and ultracompetitive Frost cast his gimlet eye on the midwesterner and decided he was no threat and could be treated politely, at least in public. Sandburg’s writing and his public persona suffer from an excess of ingenuous sincerity. His poems are all action and, like political slogans they overpower the reader in their didactic populist directness. Sandburg followed Whitman’s poetic structures, yet in his eagerness to celebrate “genuine” America and the heroism of ordinary people, he lacked the emotional qualities of the older poet. Despite it all, Sandburg is a great poet, one who must be reckoned with simply because of his relentless drive to embody America in his writing. "
47376,"In 1967 Time covered the Beatles and “their new incarnation” after the release of their eighth studio album, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, the first of a trend-setting genre of “concept albums.” When bassist Paul McCartney gave Bob Dylan a quick preview listen, Dylan quipped, “Oh I get it, you don’t want to be cute anymore.” Years later, McCartney admitted as much: “We were not boys, we were men.” In selecting British satirist Gerald Scarfe to make the cover art, Time magazine was undergoing its own “hip” transformation. Scarfe made life-sized sculptures of the Beatles for the cover; his smaller replicas are displayed here.   Los Beatles                            En 1967 Time hizo un reportaje sobre los Beatles y “su nueva encarnación” luego de lanzar al mercado su octavo disco grabado en estudio, Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, pionero en el innovador género de los “discos temáticos”. Cuando el bajista Paul McCartney invitó a Bob Dylan a escuchar un adelanto del disco, Dylan bromeó: “Ah, ya veo, no quieren seguir siendo cute”. Años más tarde, McCartney le dio la razón: “No éramos niños, éramos hombres”. Con la selección del satirista británico Gerald Scarfe para que hiciera la portada, Time a su vez gestionaba su transformación hacia un estilo más fresco. Scarfe creó esculturas tamaño natural; aquí presentamos sus reproducciones más pequeñas.

47458,"Born New York City  The daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, once said, “I have no sense of humor, just a sense of irony.” Known as “Princess Alice” during her father’s years in the White House, she later noted, “I was the daughter of an enormously popular president, and . . . I looked upon the world as my oyster.” In 1906 she married Congressman Nicholas Longworth of Cincinnati, who later became Speaker of the House. With her command of politics, celebrated wit, and supreme grace, Alice remained in the limelight of Washington society for more than seven decades.  Prominent Seattle photographer Edward Sheriff Curtis first photographed President Roosevelt and his family in 1904. He returned to Washington in 1906 to photograph Alice at the time of her marriage. That same year, President Roosevelt contributed an essay to the first volume of Curtis’s The North American Indian, an ambitious publication documenting Native American life. "

47570,"Born Orange (now Durham) County, North Carolina    From a family farm nearly ruined during the Civil War, James Duke created a tobacco empire. In 1881 he gambled by changing his company's product from pipe and chewing tobacco to cigarettes, which then occupied only a tiny share of the market. Duke pioneered the introduction of cigarette-making machines, cut labor costs, invested in massive advertising, and slashed his prices. Most important, he successfully negotiated mergers with other tobacco manufacturers to form the American Tobacco Company, and by 1902 it dominated the industry. Attracting the attention of Theodore Roosevelt's ""trust busting"" Justice Department, American Tobacco was dissolved in 1911. By that time, Duke was more involved in his hydroelectric Southern Power Company (now Duke Power) and in a variety of philanthropic activities, especially his great legacy, Duke University.    The artist made this sketch in Newport, Rhode Island, and may have used it as a study for two more formal portraits.   "
47581,"Born Bristol, Virginia  Charles Spurgeon Johnson’s studies on race relations in twentieth-century America made him, along with W.E.B. Du Bois and E. Franklin Frazier, a ""founding father"" for black sociologists. After graduating as a student of sociologist Robert E. Park at the University of Chicago and seeing combat in World War I, Johnson returned to Chicago in 1919, amid one of the worst race riots in American history. As associate director of the investigating commission, he authored The Negro in Chicago, now considered a classic analysis of the roots of race riots. Johnson next served as research director of the New York Urban League, where in 1923 he founded and edited the journal Opportunity. In this capacity Johnson became known as the ""entrepreneur of the Harlem Renaissance,"" providing a publication outlet for such talented black writers as Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston."
47790,"Mary Lou Williams began playing the piano at an early age, and by the time she reached her teens, she was performing on the road. Although many jazz musicians disliked working with female musicians, Williams persevered. As part of the Clouds of Joy Orchestra in the 1930s, she was billed as ""The Lady Who Swings the Band,"" and she supplied arrangements to such top musicians as Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines. An early convert to the bebop revolution of the 1940s, Williams also composed symphonic jazz. She retired briefly from her music career in the 1950s, converting to Catholicism and using profits from her record company to support her work helping troubled musicians. Religious themes inspired much of her later work, including the ""Music for Peace"" mass, which Alvin Ailey choreographed as ""Mary Lou's Mass"" in 1971."
47791,"This photograph was taken for Life magazine in the wee morning hours of January 6, 1950, and despite its sense of letdown, the picture is really all about triumph. Earlier that evening, Ethel Waters (far left) and Julie Harris (far right) had opened on Broadway in Carson McCullers's own adaptation of her novel The Member of the Wedding. By the time of the photograph, it had become clear that the play was a smash. McCullers's adaptation, wrote one reviewer, was ""masterly,"" and Waters's performance had been ""rich and eloquent."" But perhaps the plaudits that meant the most went to young Harris. At first Harris could not grasp the meaning of what was happening to her as she took curtain call after curtain call for her poignant portrayal of a motherless tomboy. But as the reviews flooded in, it was clear that she had become the theater's newest star."
47912,"The father of American piano making, Jonas Chickering revolutionized piano construction by developing a one-piece, cast-iron frame that could withstand the tension exerted by the piano's strings and resist extremes of temperature and humidity that made it difficult to keep the instrument in tune. Chickering's patented innovations yielded pianos of greater volume and superior resonance that were honored at the Crystal Palace exhibition in London in 1851 and became the instruments of choice in concert halls throughout the United States. When he posed for this portrait by Boston's premier daguerrean artists, Chickering was at the zenith of his career."
48023,"In response to President Abraham Lincoln’s call for 75,000 state militia in the wake of the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, the Sixth Massachusetts Volunteer Militia arrived by train in Baltimore on April 19, 1861, en route to Washington for its defense. Their unannounced presence in the city drew the ire of southern sympathizers, and a riot ensued, leaving four soldiers and twelve civilians dead. As the regiment marched along Pratt Street to board railroad cars for Washington, one soldier recalled being ""immediately assailed with stones, clubs and missiles"" from the angry mob. Volck depicted the melee in this lithograph, in which the central figure has drawn a sword from a cane and is ready to strike."
48072,"Playing his signature twelve-string guitar, Huddie Ledbetter was instrumental in introducing African American traditional music to national audiences. Known popularly as Lead Belly, a nickname given to him by a prison chaplain, he amassed a vast song repertory that ranged from the blues to early jazz and ragtime. Ironically, although a series of arrests in Louisiana and Texas almost cut short his career, they gave Ledbetter the break that transformed his life while he was in prison. In 1933, Ledbetter met folklorist John Lomax, who was traveling through the South recording folk songs from inmates-among others-for a music archive at the Library of Congress. Lomax helped to secure his parole and then accompanied him to New York. There, Ledbetter became a star, performing and recording for large audiences, many of whom had never encountered such music before."
48177,"Poor People’s Campaign  Calling it his ""last, greatest dream,"" Martin Luther King declared his intention to launch a broad-based effort to secure economic justice for the nation’s poor. At a press conference held in Atlanta’s Ebenezer Baptist Church on December 4, 1967, King revealed initial plans for an extended campaign of mass civil disobedience in Washington, D.C., that would cross racial boundaries to bring together thousands of those living in poverty. ""This will be no mere one-day march in Washington,"" he declared, ""but a trek to the nation’s capital by suffering and outraged citizens who will stay until some definite and positive action is taken to provide jobs and income for the poor."" Led by King and sponsored by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the ""Poor People’s Campaign"" was slated to begin on April 22, 1968, but was delayed after King traveled to Memphis to support a strike by that city’s sanitation workers. "
48222,"Twice a member of the Supreme Court, Charles Evans Hughes was first appointed an associate justice in 1910 but resigned in 1916 to accept the Republican nomination for president. After his narrow defeat, he returned to private law practice until 1921, when he was named secretary of state in Warren G. Harding's administration. With the Senate's rejection of the Treaty of Versailles the year before, Hughes helped forge a separate treaty with Germany, formally ending the war between the two countries. He also called a conference in Washington for the limitation of international armaments. By the time of his resignation in 1925, Hughes had given greater definition to the Monroe Doctrine and improved the quality of the U.S. Foreign Service. In 1930, Hughes was nominated again to the high court, this time as Chief Justice. "
48340,"Malvina Hoffman's success in 1909 in modeling her father's features in clay convinced her to give up her ambitions as a painter and instead travel to Paris to train as a sculptor. One of the crucial influences on her development was the Ballets Russes, which instilled her career-long concern with creating a sense of animation in her work. Nowhere was that more apparent than in her first major artistic triumph, Bachanale Russe, a high-spirited composition portraying two dancing figures.  Hoffman sometimes felt that to compete in a field dominated by men she had to exceed the norms expected of most sculptors. Once noting a need for slight modification of a huge outdoor figural piece in London, she was soon on scaffolding ninety feet above the ground, making the adjustment with hammer and chisel. It seemed, her friend Marianne Moore marveled, ""as if she had wings and carried a torch."""
48360,"I believe that education is the fundamental method of social progress and reform, stated philosopher and educator John Dewey. Perhaps his greatest work was Democracy and Education (1916), which laid the groundwork for progressive education in America. At a time when children learned mainly by rote, Dewey challenged educators to focus on a child's individual needs and rally for more participatory classrooms. According to Dewey, education, democracy, and individualism were not only intertwined, they relied upon each other for the creation of a productive society. Through education, Dewey believed that social concerns could be addressed and society as a whole better understood.  "
48511,"The illustration process for newspapers and sundry published materials was still a cumbersome procedure during the Civil War, as is evident in this scene of army officers greeting President Lincoln’s new secretary of war, Edwin M. Stanton, on January 20, 1862, the day of his official appointment. Artist Arthur Lumley began the process with a pencil and ink drawing of the event, which he probably witnessed firsthand. From the drawing, a team of carvers carved the scene—in reverse—into multiple wood blocks, which were bolted together to form the plate. The plate was inked to produce the finished illustration, published in the New-York Illustrated News on February 8, 1862."
48536,"An Oscar-winning animator and director, Chuck Jones was best known for his thirty-year career at Warner Brothers, where, in collaboration with others, he helped to create such beloved characters as Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Elmer Fudd. In 1949, Jones also invented Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner, whose antics, with no dialogue except for “beep beep,” entertained millions. In this sculpture, he is surrounded by the characters he created. Some hold sculptor’s tools themselves, effectively “making” their maker."
48598,"Meade Brothers, Daguerreotype Artists  This lithographic print of Henry (left) and Charles Meade (right) was issued not long after they established their New York City gallery. Based on daguerreotypes of the brothers and intended to promote their business, the double portrait was also reproduced as a wood engraving in the June 12, 1852, issue of Gleason’s Pictorial Drawing-Room Companion, where it illustrated a glowing tribute entitled ""THE BROTHERS MEADE"". When Henry visited England and France in 1853, he brought with him some of the ""lithographs of ourselves"" for distribution during his travels. Before leaving Paris, he noted in a letter to Charles that these prints, along with lithographs representing their portrait of Daguerre and the interior of their daguerreian gallery, were ""nice souvenirs to give and do a great deal of good. I have given all away."" This example of the double portrait carries Henry’s handwritten inscription, ""Meade Brothers."""
48618,"When James Montgomery Flagg drew his famous World War I ""I Want You"" recruiting poster, he turned to the mirror for his craggy image of Uncle Sam. Although inspired by the British image of a pointing Lord Kitchener, Flagg's version captured the public's imagination with special effectiveness. Along with the stern features of the self-portrait, the foreshortened hand gesture forged a personal connection with the viewer. A generation later, Flagg translated that familiar image into this presidential campaign piece promoting Franklin D. Roosevelt's unprecedented fourth term. The poster coyly avoids asking for votes, suggesting instead that America's duty was to convince the incumbent to run in order to ""finish the job."" The poster was issued by the Independent Voters Committee of the Arts and Sciences for Roosevelt, founded in 1944 to promote a fourth term, with the expectation that the president could deliver both victory and a progressive peace settlement."
48645,"Carte-de-visite portraits of Confederate generals  During the Civil War, the Union blockade of southern ports effectively halted the flow of most goods, including materials needed by Confederate photographers to continue their operations. Although some photographic supplies were smuggled through, by January 1862 it was reported in the North that ""the Photographic Art down South has completely died out in consequence of the war."" Because southern cameramen had virtually nothing to work with, photographs representing Confederate leaders, such as these portraits of generals Simon Bolivar Buckner, Braxton Bragg, and Albert Sidney Johnston, typically circulated in the form of retouched copy images produced in the North by such firms as E. & H. T. Anthony rather than as original life portraits created in the South."
48713,"At the 1924 Olympics, Gertrude Ederle won one gold and two bronze medals in swimming. But her greatest athletic accomplishment began at 7:08 a.m. on August 6, 1926. Covered in an array of protective oils, she plunged into the frigid waters of the English Channel, near Calais, and began swimming toward England's Dover coast, twenty-one miles away. As she progressed, the weather became so bad that her trainers urged her to come out of the water, but she refused to stop. Finally, fourteen hours and thirty-one minutes after starting out, she became the sixth person and first woman to swim the channel, with a crossing time that bested all her predecessors by well over an hour. Ederle proved wrong all those who doubted that a woman could manage the feat, and helped establish the place of women in competitive sports.  "
48832,"Civil War Sheet Music  Civil War music usually fell into one of several categories: songs to rally the troops, spirituals sung by slaves, songs sung by families at home, and songs that reflected the homesickness many soldiers felt. The pieces of sheet music displayed here commemorate the lives and celebrate the feats of four Confederate leaders: President Jefferson Davis and Generals P. G. T. Beauregard, Stonewall Jackson, and Robert E. Lee.  ""Stonewall"" Jackson’s Prayer"
48872,"Through me forbidden voices;/Voice of sexes and lusts-voices veil'd/and I remove the veil; Voices indecent, by me clarified and transfigur'd.   -Leaves of Grass    When Walt Whitman first published Leaves of Grass in 1855, he found the source for American vitality in a democracy rooted in the connection between its people and nature. Whitman's refusal to accept the existence of boundaries and limits on the body, as well as the mind, is the most radical statement ever of American individualism. Expansively omnisexual in his writings, Whitman spent the Civil War years and after with his lover, Peter Doyle, a Confederate deserter. Daringly, inspired by the comradeship engendered between men under fire, Whitman celebrated love and affection between men in poems he collected under the titles Drum Taps"" and ""Calamus."" Just as society's attitudes were consolidating into a rigid division that outlawed the homosexual, Whitman's poetry (and his life) proclaimed that the possibilities of desire were not so easily characterized and contained."
49023,"The practice of medicine during the Civil War was crude, but advances were being made. Ether and chloroform were routinely used as anesthesia prior to surgery, for example. But as with other commodities, medical supplies were more scarce in the South than in the North. This lithograph depicts Confederates smuggling medicines, perhaps across the Potomac from Maryland or from a point farther south. The boat is a reminder that many goods had to be smuggled into the Confederacy because of the Union blockade of the seaports, which increasingly prevented trade as the war progressed."
49054,"Like fellow industrialist Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick grew up in a family of limited means. Yet by age thirty he had made his first million dollars and had positioned himself as a key player in America's industrial development. Believing that steel would be the principal building material of the future, Frick amassed his fortune first by supplying coke-fuel made from coal-to the steel industry and later by partnering with Carnegie to create the world's largest steel company. A cutthroat businessman who opposed labor unions, Frick was aggressive in making his operations more efficient. In 1892, during a violent confrontation with striking steelworkers in Homestead, Pennsylvania, he did not hesitate to call in guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency and the state militia to break the union's resolve. This double portrait shows the industrialist with his daughter Helen."
49146,"Another in Alexander Gardner’s valedictory series of the major Union commanders in each theater of the war, this photograph groups four of the figures from the 1864 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley under the command of Philip Sheridan (1831–1888). Sheridan is standing to the left; at the table are cavalry officer Wesley Merritt (1834–1910); George Crook (1830–1890), who had an independent force in western Virginia before joining Sheridan’s army; Sheridan’s chief of staff, James W. Forsyth (1835–1906); and perhaps America’s most famous cavalryman, George A. Custer (1839–1876).  This photograph brings together the men who would be major figures in the settlement of the Great Plains and the Indian Wars—none more emblematic than Custer. As such, it provides the bridge between the first half of Gardner’s career during the Civil War and the images of western land and people on which he focused during the rest of his photographic career. One war had ended; another was beginning."
49215,"Braxton Bragg was one of many well-known West Point graduates who sided with their native southern states at the start of the Civil War. As a major general, Bragg first distinguished himself at the Battle of Shiloh in Tennessee, where his men captured thousands of prisoners and many guns. In spite of Bragg's energy and organizational talents, his failure to follow up on his victories in the West eventually contributed to the fall of that vital region.  "
49343,"Lydia Henchman Hancock  1714–1777  Born Boston, Massachusetts  Thomas Hancock  1703–1764  Born Lexington, Massachusetts     John Singleton Copley painted these pillars of Boston society, aunt and uncle to the patriot John Hancock, near the beginning of his career. Copley trained himself in making paintings “in littel,” as oil-on-copper miniatures were then known; the more fashionable European technique of using watercolor on ivory was not yet well established in the colonies. Copley painted Thomas Hancock first, around 1758. After his death, Hancock’s widow had her portrait done in miniature by Copley. The artist then set his original miniature into a larger, oval piece of copper to match her portrait so that they could be displayed as framed pendants."
49397,"On December 28, 1962, when Elaine began to sketch the president, she recalled that ""he wore a sweatshirt, white sailing pants and sneakers. He perched one foot on the chair and said, ‘Is this all right?’"" She realized ""that he was not interested in a painting of a man seated behind a desk with folded hands, so I took his improvised pose as a cue and I began sketching. This was the only time I saw him dressed casually."" As she began to work, she used ""pencil, pen and ink and charcoal. Charcoal’s great, because it enables you to go like lightening [sic]. . . . When he’d change his position, I’d switch drawings. . . . I kept jumping back and forth.""  El 28 de diciembre de 1962, cuando Elaine comenzó a hacer bocetos del presidente, y según ella misma recordaba, “él llevaba un pulóver, pantalones marineros blancos y zapatos deportivos. Trepó un pie en la silla y dijo: ¿Está bien así?”. Ahí se dio cuenta de que “a él no le interesaba una pintura sentado tras un escritorio con las manos cruzadas, así que tomé su pose improvisada como punto de partida y empecé a dibujar. Esa fue la única vez que lo vi vestido informalmente”. En el proceso de trabajo alternaba “lápiz, plumilla y carboncillo. El carboncillo es fantástico porque te permite dibujar como un relámpago. [...] Cuando él cambiaba de postura, yo cambiaba de dibujo. [...] Me la pasaba yendo y viniendo de un dibujo al otro”.     "
49401,"Often referred to as the ""empire builder,"" James J. Hill rose from humble beginnings to command one of the largest railroad networks in the West. He acquired his first line in 1878 and over the course of the next four decades bought or built more than six thousand miles of railroad lines, principally on the northern plains and in the Pacific Northwest. The founder of the Great Northern Railway, Hill competed aggressively with the Union Pacific and the Northern Pacific railroads for control of the transcontinental freight business. Although he could be ruthless in his transactions, he was regarded by many as a relatively benevolent developer. In 1904 he was found in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and was forced to dissolve the holding company that controlled his various enterprises. Nevertheless, he and the Great Northern Railway continued to play a dominant role in the nation's transportation industry."
49465,"In 1898, Theodore Roosevelt's political ambitions were greatly enhanced as a result of his participation in the Spanish-American War. Roosevelt had resigned his post as assistant secretary of the navy, from which he had argued the case for war against Spain, to organize the First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment, which served in Cuba. He returned a hero after leading his rugged regiment-the ""Rough Riders""-to victory in the San Juan highlands above Santiago. Roosevelt received voluminous praise, as suggested by this cartoon from Judge magazine, in which he is shown riding upon an elephant, symbol of the Republican Party. His name was even being mentioned for the presidency. That fall, Roosevelt was elected governor of New York. Two years later, he was elected vice president for President William McKinley's second administration. When McKinley was assassinated in 1901, Roosevelt became, at age forty-two, the youngest president of the United States."
49541,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
49575,"Paolo Garretto's witty depiction of Fritz Kreisler is an aptly disembodied portrait for a musician whose fame rests as much on his recordings as on his physical stage presence. The Viennese-born violinist's reputation was well established in the first decade of the twentieth century, particularly in America, where tours fueled an enthusiastic popular following. But his 1910 recording contract with the Victor Phonograph Company gave him a previously unimaginable degree of renown.  Garretto's portrait, drawn on a thin piece of wood veneer against an airbrushed color background, reflects his exposure to Italian futurism, French art deco design, and surrealist imagery. Under Garretto's hands, noted one contemporary, ""persons become moving puppets. . . . [His] drawings might really be called . . . marvelous surrealistic toys for adults."" This playful merging of man and violin appeared in Vanity Fair magazine in 1934."

49609,"For more than thirty years Edward S. Curtis traveled throughout the West, studying and photographing Native American communities. His ambitious goal was to produce a comprehensive documentary record of what he described as ""one of the greatest races of mankind,"" yet one that was destined to ""be lost for all time."" With encouragement from Theodore Roosevelt and financial support from banker J. P. Morgan, Curtis created more than forty thousand photographs that pictured many aspects of Native American life. Influenced by fine art photography, he emphasized aesthetics as much as ethnographic information. A selection of these images was included within his deluxe twenty-volume series, The North American Indian (1907-30). Curtis also collected cylinder recordings of Native American music and in 1914 released a ground-breaking silent film, In the Land of the Head Hunters, about the Kwakiutl of British Columbia. This dashing self-portrait shows the Seattle-based photographer at the outset of his career."
49610,"While John Steinbeck and Erskine Caldwell chronicled the Great Depression's impact on rural America in words, Walker Evans recorded it with his camera. Evans never had much use for photographic gimmicks, and as a photographer charged by the New Deal's Farm Security Administration to document conditions in the country's agricultural regions, he carried only the most basic equipment. But that equipment proved more than ample. The FSA pictures taken by Evans from 1935 to 1937 recorded with often jolting clarity the toll of the Depression on the rural South.  Evans left FSA to collaborate with James Agee on a project that turned into Let Us Now Praise Famous Men, a volume that melded Agee's narrative with Evans's  photographs depicting the harsh life of three tenant-farmer families. Though initially a commercial failure, the book has long since become a classic embodiment of the era it documents."
49703,"The victor at Gettysburg, George Meade (1815–1872), seated center, ended the war with a sense that he had been overlooked and dealt with unfairly. Abraham Lincoln’s criticism that he had failed to vigorously pursue Robert E. Lee after Gettysburg still rankled. And while Meade retained command of the Army of the Potomac, Ulysses Grant’s decision to serve in the field meant that Meade would always be overshadowed by the Union’s commanding general, both in day-to-day decision-making and by reputation. Meade served faithfully and punctiliously under Grant, and Grant testified to Meade’s character in his Memoirs.  Meade was only the last of the many commanders of the Army of the Potomac who was bedeviled by the army’s nearness to Washington and the propensity of its officers to play politics. Aware of its history, Meade, who was a superior corps commander, had not desired overall command in 1863 but was unable to turn Lincoln down."
49771,"   Born Oyster Bay, New York  America’s first native-born sculptor, Patience Wright modeled portraits of celebrities in tinted wax, exhibiting them with success in Philadelphia and New York. Her sculpting career began as a domestic activity with her five children. After her husband’s death in 1769, though, this pastime became a profession. Not long afterward, a fire destroyed much of her collection, an event that led her to relocate to England. There Wright pursued portrait commissions and established a museum to display new examples of her work. This venture proved an instant sensation and won her an enthusiastic following that included King George III. When war broke out in 1776, she fell from favor in royal circles because of her open support for the colonial cause. Later proclaiming that ""women are always useful in grand events,"" Wright became an American spy and sent intelligence to Benjamin Franklin in Paris."
49880,"Born Berkeley, James City County, Virginia   This deathbed scene, a format popular in the mid-nineteenth century, marks the passing of President William Henry Harrison, who caught pneumonia while giving a long inaugural address in bad weather. The words written on the paper—""Sir I wish you to understand the true principles of government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more""—were reputedly Harrison’s final instructions to Vice President John Tyler. In office only a month, the Whig Party’s Harrison had alienated the most powerful Whig in the Senate, Henry Clay, by selecting Clay’s rival, Daniel Webster, to be secretary of state. Harrison had quickly called Congress into session to consider a number of Whig proposals, but Clay, determined to dominate from the Senate, never acted on them. On assuming the presidency, Tyler, a Democrat from Virginia chosen as Harrison’s running mate to win southern support, opposed Harrison’s program. (Interestingly, neither Clay nor Tyler are depicted here.) "
49923,"Long known as the ""First Lady of the American Theater,"" Helen Hayes won international esteem for a career that spanned eight decades on stage and in films, radio, and television. She won an Academy Award as Best Actress for her first film, The Sin of Madelon Claudet (1931), and went on to appear in such major pictures as A Farewell to Arms (1932) and Anastasia (1956). Yet she always considered the stage her real home: after making her Broadway debut at the age of nine in Old Dutch, she went on to star in hit productions of Caesar and Cleopatra (1925), Mary of Scotland (1933), and Victoria Regina (1935), probably her most famous role, which ran for 969 performances. After the war, she appeared in landmark productions of The Glass Menagerie, The Skin of Our Teeth, A Touch of the Poet, The Cherry Orchard, The Chalk Garden, and Long Day's Journey into Night. She won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in  Airport (1970). The Helen Hayes Award for theater in Washington, D.C. is named in her honor.  "
49974,"A Wall Street financier who made millions speculating on commodities, Bernard Baruch believed that governments had a limited but salutary role to play in stabilizing markets and prices. Beginning with the presidency of Woodrow Wilson, Baruch's political connections, manipulation of the press, and financial contributions to senators and presidents enabled him to assume the role of éminence grise in the Democratic Party. Baruch initially played an important role in Roosevelt's early New Deal, later rejecting FDR's ambitious public works programs, and then with World War II resumed his role as ""adviser to presidents."" As with Wilson during World War I, he became the administration's public spokesman and chaired committees dealing with war production. Baruch retained his influence under Truman, serving as U.S. ambassador to the UN Atomic Energy Commission, but would lose his role as ""political kingmaker"" soon afterward. "
50028,"Born Hardin County, Kentucky   In 1858, at the time of his fourth debate with Stephen Douglas, Abraham Lincoln yielded to the request of Mrs. Harriet Chapman for a photographic portrait. When sending the resulting image to Chapman, who was his stepmother’s granddaughter, Lincoln noted, ""This is not a very good-looking picture but it’s the best that could be produced from the poor subject."" One of several contemporaneous copies of the original portrait, this laterally reversed ambrotype presents a mirror image of its subject, so that Lincoln’s distinctive mole appears on the left rather than the right side of his face."
50035,"Born Terre Haute, Indiana      When the young journalist Theodore Dreiser published his first novel, Sister Carrie, in 1900, even his publisher was shocked, and the book was virtually banned. Nevertheless, this tale of compromised virtue within a harsh urban environment would ultimately be regarded as a watershed move toward greater frankness in American fiction. Dreiser continued to probe the unvarnished realities of urban life in such works from the 1910s as Jennie Gerhardt, The Titan, and The Genius. But it was not until the appearance of An American Tragedy in 1925 that Dreiser finally received serious attention as one of the most significant realists in American literary history. Nonetheless Dreiser, a lifelong advocate of freedom of expression, battled censorship his whole career. Henry Varnum Poor made this portrait at the time the contentious author had begun to get involved in the politics of radical protest."
50042,"Martin Luther King Jr. with Coretta Scott King and their daughter Yolanda on the steps of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church  While at Boston University, King met Coretta Scott, an Alabama native who was studying voice at the New England Conservatory of Music. After overcoming resistance from ""Daddy"" King, who had expected his son to choose an Atlantan as his bride, the couple married in June 1953.  King began looking for employment opportunities in academia and in the ministry during his third year in Boston and was invited to preach trial sermons at several churches, including the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, Alabama. The youthful King captivated the Dexter congregation when he preached there in January 1954, and in April he agreed to accept the church’s pastorship, following completion of his doctoral coursework. King delivered his first sermon as resident pastor there on September 5, 1954. The Kings welcomed their first child, Yolanda in November 1955."
50064,"This heroic sculpture depicts George Washington as a Roman emperor, a popular European tradition for representing political and military leaders. The portrait is based on a likeness modeled in Philadelphia in 1791 or 1792 by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi, who came to the United States seeking the commission for a congressional monument to Washington (which was never made). A plaster cast of his life portrait of Washington was acquired in 1809 by Thomas Appleton, American consul in Livorno (Leghorn), Italy. A decade later, Italian sculptor Massimiliano Ravenna made several marble copies of the portrait for sale in the United States."
50122,"Born Williamsport, Pennsylvania    A prizefighter, vaudevillian, cartoonist, and newspaper sketch artist before he turned to painting, George Luks brought great vitality to his art. William Glackens suggests Luks’s personality and his rapid brushwork in this painting of 1899 when the two were roommates in New York City. Along with Glackens, Robert Henri, John Sloan, and Everett Shinn, Luks chose to depict the unglamorous—and sometimes sordid—reality of urban life. Initially, disapproving critics dubbed them the Ashcan School. But when they rebelled against the tradition-bound National Academy shows by holding their own exhibition with three other artists in 1908, commentators heralded a new American art. The well-publicized independence of “The Eight” opened up the art world and encouraged unjuried exhibitions. Although never a modernist, Luks participated in the controversial Armory Show of 1913, which introduced the latest European trends to American audiences."
50155,"Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, Indian fighter and hero of the Battle of New Orleans-the first president of truly humble background and the first from the West-ushered in a new political era. His supporters hailed him as ""The People's President""; conservatives saw his election as the ascent of ""King Mob."" Before his two terms in office were out, Jackson vetoed more legislation than his predecessors combined, and his opponents coalesced into a new political party called the Whigs."
50193,"Al Frueh, an illustrator for the New Yorker, among other magazines, streamlines and attenuates Katharine Cornell's large eyes and mouth and her elongated neck so as to highlight-and also parody-her distinctive features. Like Calder, Frueh reveals how easily Cornell's features lend themselves to exaggeration and caricature. "
50249,"Born Attleboro, Bucks County, Pennsylvania    Edward Hicks was a Quaker preacher who made his living as a coach and sign painter. His life was directed by his religion, and in the pictures he undertook as a labor of love he returned repeatedly to a pacifist theme inspired by the prophecy in the Old Testament's book of Isaiah: ""The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid."" Portrayed by his cousin Thomas, Edward Hicks is here at work on one of the hundred or so versions of The Peaceable Kingdom that he painted between 1820 and the night before his death in 1849. His artwork was sold, bartered, or given away to his Bucks County, Pennsylvania, neighbors, and until the twentieth century Hicks was renowned, not as an artist, but for his ability to share aloud the ""inner light"" arising from silent spiritual contemplation.  "
50295,"America's leading futurist artist, Joseph Stella created monumental abstract paintings characterized by dramatic contrasts of light and color, thrusting diagonals, and dynamic movement. But this self-portrait focuses instead on self-revelation, reflecting the contradictions of Stella's artistic and personal life. Not known to be an introspective person, the Italian-born artist studied his own image more intensely as he grew older and more reclusive. Although the pose here recalls the classical Renaissance profiles he admired, the intensity and complexity of the image belie this tradition. Touches of red on the lips, eyelid, nose, and cheek are unsettling. The turbulent pattern and acrid yellow splotches in the background reinforce the sense of anxiety. Yet the concentration of his gaze, the flare of his nostril, and the set of his lips convey the spirit of a headstrong individual who persists despite emotional turmoil.  "
50334,"Coolidge's legendary silence and dry Vermont wit is legendary. His ""Silent Cal"" sobriquet derived from oft-repeated tales such as his ""You lose"" response to a woman who bet that she could get more than two words out of him. Coolidge's minimalist approach to conversation reflected his Jeffersonian view that the best government is that which governs least and that ""the people of America [should] . . . … work less for the government and more for themselves."" Journalist Walter Lippmann wrote of Coolidge, ""Inactivity is a political philosophy . . . . with Mr. Coolidge, and nobody should mistake his unflinching adherence to it for a soft and easy desire to let things slide."" Samuel Woolf's drawings of Coolidge, which appeared in newspapers and magazines, animated a diffident, reserved president and reflected the artist's feeling that he was ""one of the most human people I ever met."""
50344,"By the time she was fifty, Marjory Stoneman Douglas could look back with satisfaction on a varied career that included working as a reporter, columnist, and editor for the Miami Herald and as a successful short-story writer. But her most significant work began in the mid-1940s, when she wrote a book on the Florida Everglades. The Everglades: River of Grass (1947) became an instant best-seller, and for the public at large it called attention to the ecological importance of this vast expanse of water and wildlife. Many years later, the book also led to Douglas's founding of the Friends of the Everglades, which grew into a major force in the campaign to protect the area's natural integrity against a host of human-created abuses. In 1993, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom."
50417,"Elizabeth Cady Stanton was a feminist from the start, refusing to include ""obey"" in her marriage vows to her husband; and when she spoke of God, she used the female pronoun. Stanton helped organize the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848, which was the founding moment of the American women's rights movement, and she was the longtime president of the National Woman Suffrage Association. Although Stanton's goal was to give women political power through the ballot, she also spearheaded other feminist goals, such as liberalizing divorce laws and reforming child-rearing methods. But unlike other early feminists, she always insisted on the primacy of women's right to vote over other reform objectives, including abolition. She wrote, ""Our 'pathway' is straight to the ballot box with no variableness nor shadow of turning."""
50497,"In 1820, White House incumbent James Monroe stood virtually unopposed in his bid for a second term, an expression of the so-called ""Era of Good Feelings"" that set in after the War of 1812 and was marked by a temporary halt in two-party factionalism.  Monroe brought to his presidency a style that meshed well with this rancorless climate. When, for example, he vetoed public improvements legislation, he offered Congress suggestions for accomplishing the same end through means that circumvented his Constitution-based objections. The most enduring legacy of his administration, however, was the Monroe Doctrine, which registered opposition to European meddling in the Western Hemisphere. It ultimately became a keystone of American foreign policy.  The restrained coloring and brushwork in Monroe's portrait by John Vanderlyn testifies to the strong influence of French neoclassicism during the artist's years of study in Paris. It may also reflect Monroe's own tastes, which ran decidedly to the French as a result of his several diplomatic missions to Paris."
50520,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    Comedian, producer, author, actor, and civic activist Bill Cosby has had one of the most successful careers in the history of American entertainment and public culture. Starting out as a comedian, Cosby crossed over to television in the 1960s. Becoming one of the first African American television stars in the series I Spy, he later spun off other projects such as the cartoon Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. He achieved his greatest success as Cliff Huxtable, becoming ""America's dad"" on The Cosby Show (1984-92), the first television sitcom to feature an upper-middle-class black family. While humorous and entertaining, the show also was intended by Cosby to demonstrate the achievements of African Americans in society as they express pride in their race and heritage. As an education and civic reformer, Cosby has taken a public stance-and drawn controversy- against cultural practices that he feels damage the black community. "
50680,"Photography brought the war home to civilians as the army became the subject of the camera’s eye. In the midst of the siege of Petersburg, Mathew Brady took this little vignette of Grant taking time out from the campaign to see his wife, Julia, and son Jesse. Grant was very domestic, and many of his more difficult moments, especially his resort to alcohol, occurred when he was separated from them for long periods. His letters during the war mixed campaign news with pleas that Julia write more frequently and with more details about their children.  Ulysses S. Grant y familia     La fotografía llevó la guerra a la población civil puesto que el ejército se había convertido en el objeto del ojo de la cámara. En medio del asedio de Petersburg, Mathew Brady tomó esta pequeña viñeta de Grant mientras se tomaba un descanso de la campaña para ver a su esposa, Julia, y su hijo, Jesse. Grant era muy hogareño y muchos de sus momentos más difíciles, sobre todo su refugio en el alcohol, se produjeron cuando estaba separado de ellos durante largos períodos.  Sus cartas durante la guerra mezclaban las noticias de la campaña con súplicas para que Julia escribiera con más frecuencia y con más detalle acerca de sus hijos.     Mathew B.

50698,"Will Rogers, who was part Cherokee, once told a Boston audience, ""My ancestors didn't come over on the Mayflower-they met the boat."" He spent his youth in traveling circuses as a rope artist and roughrider, later adding jokes to his lariat tricks. Eventually he wound up on the vaudeville circuit, and by 1912 on Broadway, where he became a star of the Ziegfeld Follies. He also embarked on a motion picture and then a radio career that would establish him as America's homespun philosopher. When he died in an airplane crash in 1935, Rogers was arguably the nation's best-loved personality."
50734,"Taking office in 1933, against the bleak backdrop of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt responded quickly to this economic disaster with a host of regulatory and welfare measures that redefined the government's role in American life. Among conservatives, the new federal involvement in matters traditionally left to the private sector was a betrayal of America's ideals. But in other quarters, Roosevelt's activism inspired an unwavering popularity that led to his election to an unprecedented four terms.   Roosevelt sat for this formal portrait less than three months after his inauguration as the nation's thirty-second president. When the photograph was later published by Vanity Fair to mark FDR's first anniversary in office, it was accompanied by a page of headlines from the New York Times that charted ""the amazing progress of the New Deal""-from Roosevelt's efforts to end the national banking crisis to the repeal of Prohibition. "
50760,"Time was for many years skittish about emphasizing the physical allure of Hollywood sex symbols in its newsmaker cover portraits. In a 1956 cover, for example, Marilyn Monroe appeared innocently demure compared with the frankly come-hither quality of her publicity photographs. By 1969, however, with a revolution in sexual freedom in full swing, Time deemed such restraint unnecessary. For its cover of movie siren Raquel Welch, it turned to Frank Gallo, an artist who specialized in provocative female art. The result was this life-size sculpture.  Yet the magazine’s editors badly miscalculated what many of its readers considered appropriate for the cover of their favorite coffee-table newsweekly. Of the more than 900 individuals who wrote to express an opinion about the cover, the overwhelming majority disapproved.   Raquel Welch  nacida en 1940      En sus portadas, Time evadió por muchos años con cierto nerviosismo el énfasis en los atractivos físicos de los símbolos sexuales de Hollywood. Es así que en una portada de 1956, Marilyn Monroe aparece inocente y recatada en comparación con el carácter francamente sensual de sus fotos publicitarias. Sin embargo, para 1969, en pleno apogeo de la liberación sexual, Time creyó innecesario este tipo de reserva. Para su portada de la sirena del cine Raquel Welch, la revista recurrió al artista Frank Gallo, quien se especializaba en provocadoras imágenes femeninas. El resultado fue esta escultura de tamaño natural.              Pero los editores se equivocaron al juzgar lo que sus lectores considerarían adecuado en la portada de su semanario de actualidad favorito. De las más de 900 personas que escribieron para expresar su opinión sobre la portada, la enorme mayoría la rechazó.

50874,"Thirty-sixth President, 1963-69    When Time tapped Lyndon B. Johnson for its 1964 Man of the Year cover, Johnson had just completed the most successful twelve months of his public career. Having succeeded to the presidency on the death of John F. Kennedy in late 1963, he had claimed this office in his own right with a landslide victory in the recent national election. In the year preceding, his deft handling of Congress had yielded the most sweeping civil rights legislation since the Civil War, resulted in a vastly reduced deficit, and set in motion an unprecedented war on poverty.   To paint the cover portrait, Time selected two of the Southwest's most respected artists-Peter Hurd and his wife, Henriette Wyeth. Hurd and Wyeth placed Johnson against a sun-drenched Texas landscape, with the president's birthplace in the distance.    Time cover, January 1, 1965"
50934,"Following the Treaty of Kanagawa in 1854, Commodore Matthew Perry visited the ports and harbors that Japan had opened to the United States. Shimoda, the site of a new American consulship, was located in southern Japan and was fairly isolated, discouraging the development of trade. Yet its importance in the newly signed treaty elevated it to an imperial city. During Perry's second trip to Shimoda, he met with the emperor's commissioners. He arrived with more than 300 officers, seamen, and Marines and later entertained the commissioners with dancing on his flagship. This lithograph, part of a series produced by Eliphalet Brown Jr. and Peter Bernard William Heine, both of whom accompanied Perry on his expedition, shows the people of Shimoda greeting the Americans as they arrived on the beach."
50945,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
50984,"Two weeks after James Lawrence took command of the frigate Chesapeake, he was challenged to battle by Captain Philip Broke. Broke, commander of the British frigate Shannon for seven years, was known for his rigorous gunnery training. Lawrence accepted the challenge and in a quixotic nod to chivalry passed up an opportunity of raking Shannon’s deck with gunfire. The Chesapeake inflicted great damage, but the Shannon’s accurate gunnery quickly disabled the frigate. Lawrence, fatally wounded, issued his famous order, ""Don’t give up the ship."" But the helpless Chesapeake was quickly captured, and the 228 casualties for both vessels made it the bloodiest frigate action of the war. It was Britain’s first major naval victory, and Broke became a British hero. Later, Oliver Hazard Perry dramatically unfurled Lawrence’s last words on a pennant to signal the beginning of the Battle of Lake Erie."
51202,"Rock promoter Bill Graham helped guide the Jefferson Airplane band to success in the vanguard of the country's anti-establishment hippie revolution. This advertisement for their 1967 concert at Graham's Fillmore Auditorium has all the elements of the classic psychedelic poster: searing colors, portraits of the musicians, ambiguous hand-drawn elements, and swelling letters that dance before the viewer's eyes. Such advertisements suggested the dizzying, multisensory experience of many Fillmore dance concerts, which were charged with high-decibel music, light shows, frenetic movement, and, often, mind-expanding drugs. The posters, visual symbols of the rock scene and the counterculture, began to vanish as soon as they appeared, grabbed by increasing numbers of collectors. Graham and other publishers produced extra quantities for retail sale, and poster stores opened in all the major cities. ""Posters in every dimension and description . . . are being plastered across the U.S.,"" Life magazine reported in 1967."
51223,"Scottish-born Alexander Graham Bell studied speech from an early age. While trying to improve the telegraph, Bell discovered that the voice could be transformed into electric current and transmitted over a wire. He exhibited his telephone at the 1876 Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia, where the startled emperor of Brazil exclaimed, ""I hear, I hear!"" Bell's invention revolutionized communication, leading to the establishment of the Bell Telephone Company. Upon learning of the inventor's death, his friend and competitor Thomas Edison observed: ""[he] brought the human family in closer touch."""
51307,"Since single portraits of national heroes sold well during the Civil War, publishers assumed that composite group portraits filled with many generals, cabinet members, or naval officers would be just as appealing. Yet as military leadership shifted and reputations rose and fell, the prints quickly became outdated. In this lithograph of Union naval officers, two of the heads are missing; either they had not yet been drawn or, more likely, they had been burnished out in preparation for adding new heroes. The figures in this print are (left to right): John L. Worden, Andrew A. Harwood, David G. Farragut, Theodorus Bailey, Samuel F. Du Pont, Charles Henry Davis, Andrew Hull Foote, Silas H. Stringham, Louis M. Goldsborough, Charles Wilkes, and David Dixon Porter."
51355,"At the zenith of his career, as Arnold Newman depicted him here, city planner Robert Moses bestrode the skyline of New York City as no official has done before or since. Moses' career began in 1912 as a civil service reformer. Impatient with old-style politics, Moses realized that by mastering the increasingly complex machinery of government, he could create his vision of a modern city. Moses built roads and bridges to link the city with its suburbs and supervised programs ranging from clearing slums to building the Lincoln Center. Above all, Moses built a new type of city government, transferring power from what he saw as parochial (and possibly corrupt) politicians to supposedly disinterested city planners and managers. But Moses was forced out of office in 1963 by politicians concerned with the power he wielded without governmental or public oversight."
51419,"Nat ""King"" Cole first made his name in pop music primarily as a pianist with the King Cole jazz trio that he formed in 1939, and some experts think that his most significant contribution to music was a keyboard technique that influenced a number of other noted musicians. But by 1950, the public at large was coming to know Cole as the crooner whose relaxed manner went hand-in-glove with his caressing voice. As hits such as ""Mona Lisa"" and ""Unforgettable"" followed one another, he became one of America's favorite entertainers, and in the fall of 1956, he was the first African American to host a network television show. Cole was sometimes faulted for not being more outspoken in the civil rights cause, but his broad popular appeal was in itself a contribution to the struggle against racism. "
51474,"Lee’s reputation as a leader, and the swashbuckling way he won his major victories, was reflected on the generals he commanded: “Jeb” Stuart, James Longstreet, “Stonewall” Jackson, and others all became legendary. They deserved the plaudits. Yet they were not without fault, and Lee, who did not like personal confrontation, always had difficulty imposing his will on subordinates. The death of Stonewall Jackson deprived Lee of his most valued lieutenant, and he never found an adequate replacement either to command Jackson’s troops or to almost intuitively understand and execute Lee’s plans. Lee held a loose rein on his generals, trusting them as he did Jackson, but too frequently they let him down at crucial moments. This happened most notably at Gettysburg, where Stuart led the cavalry off on a wild goose chase and other generals were dilatory or recalcitrant.  Robert E. Lee y sus generales     La reputación de Lee como líder y la manera intrépida en que logró sus victorias más importantes se vio reflejada en los generales que comandaba: “Jeb” Stuart, James Longstreet, “muro de piedra” Jackson y otros, se volvieron todos legendarios. Ellos merecían los aplausos. Sin embargo, no estaban libres de culpa y Lee, a quien no le gustaba la confrontación personal, siempre tuvo dificultad para imponer su voluntad en sus subordinados. La muerte de ""muro de piedra"" Jackson despojó a Lee de su teniente más valorado; nunca encontró un reemplazo adecuado para comandar las tropas de Jackson o que entendiera casi intuitivamente y ejecutara los planes de Lee. Lee le dio rienda suelta a sus generales, confió en ellos como lo hizo con Jackson, pero lo decepcionaban muy frecuentemente en los momentos cruciales. Esto ocurría especialmente en Gettysburg, donde Stuart conducía la caballería hacia una persecución absurda y los otros generales eran dilatorios y recalcitrantes.

51515,"In a series of novels including Main Street and Babbitt, Sinclair Lewis popularized a skeptical new view of American values in the 1920s. His message was often severe: American society stifled idealism and, in its push for conformity and material goods, crushed those who departed from convention. Assailing small-town narrow-mindedness, Lewis addressed such topics as religious hypocrisy, racism, and changing gender roles. When Nickolas Muray photographed him, Lewis, annoyed by past oversights, had recently declined the Pulitzer Prize. In 1930, however, Lewis became the first American to receive the Nobel Prize for Literature, which he saw as a tribute to recent authors' efforts to ""express the sweep and strength and beauty-in-ugliness of the American empire as it is today."" Muray concealed Lewis's heavily pocked complexion with soft focus and artful retouching, using the sharper, graceful hand in the foreground to suggest his eloquence.  "
51554,"Milton Glaser, one of the founders of New York's Push Pin Studios, created an icon of 1960s counterculture in his now-classic Dylan poster. It was a new form of poster, according to the artist, created as a bonus insert for the Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits album of 1967. Dylan, who wrote such songs as ""Blowin' in the Wind"" and ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" was the folk-rock poet of the 1960s, and Glaser used his famous name as a typographically innovative design feature on the poster. In addition, by pairing a bold, black profile inspired by Marcel Duchamp's self-portrait silhouette with bright-colored writhing curves reminiscent of psychedelic rock posters, Glaser merged West Coast exuberance with pared-down East Coast stylization. According to some reports, six million copies were distributed, and the Dylan poster has been spotted in such remote areas as a hut in the Amazon rain forest."
51593,"Perhaps best known for his Oscar-winning role as Atticus Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962), Gregory Peck rose to Hollywood stardom in the 1940s. From the outset, Peck gravitated towards roles demonstrating virtues of quiet strength, resolve, and tolerance. By the end of his career, he had earned five Academy Award nominations for his performances, including his work in The Keys of the Kingdom (1944), The Yearling (1946), Gentleman’s Agreement (1947), Twelve O’ Clock High (1949), and To Kill a Mockingbird. Outside of Hollywood, Peck advocated for gun control and protested the Vietnam War. His many honors include the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Screen Actors Guild Lifetime Achievement Award, the AFI Life Achievement Award, and the National Medal of Arts."
51652,"Born Brooklyn, New York  ""I used to be Snow White, but I . . . drifted."" Mae West—actress, playwright, and screenwriter—was known equally for her double-entendres. She first burst into fame dancing the ""shimmy"" in the 1918 Shubert Brothers revue Sometime. Soon she began incorporating outrageous moves and lines into all of her performances. In 1926, she wrote, directed, and starred in the Broadway play Sex, a show that created such a scandal that she was prosecuted on morals charges. West served eight days in jail but capitalized on the widespread media attention it gave her. Undaunted, she wrote The Wicked Age, Pleasure Man, and The Constant Sinner before striking gold in 1928 with her play Diamond Lil. Hollywood then beckoned, where West—after boosting Cary Grant’s career in 1933 in She Done Him Wrong and I’m No Angel—scored her biggest box-office hit co-starring with W. C. Fields in My Little Chickadee (1940). "
51802,"Born Tyumen, Russia    The dean of American popular song, composer-lyricist Irving Berlin wrote more than 3,000 songs, including “God Bless America” and “White Christmas.” Arriving in New York City as a child, he worked to survive after his father died, selling newspapers, waiting tables, and plugging songs. Berlin’s first hit song, “Alexander’s Ragtime Band,” became the rage in 1911; three years later, his first musical, Watch Your Step, cemented his reputation. He wrote twenty-one Broadway scores, including Annie Get Your Gun (1946), which featured Ethel Merman singing “There’s No Business Like Show Business.” Berlin also wrote seventeen film scores, including Top Hat (1935), Holiday Inn (1947), and Easter Parade (1948).  Mexican caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias, who worked in New York between 1924 and 1932, depicted Berlin with five other popular culture headliners for the March 1925 issue of Vanity Fair: heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, movie star Gloria Swanson, playwright Eugene O’Neill, Broadway star Florence Mills, and stage designer Robert Edmond Jones."
51847,"During his 1960 visit to the United Nations, on New York City's East Side, Nikita Khrushchev was accompanied by eight Communist bloc leaders.

51849,"Single-handedly, William Lloyd Garrison transformed the antislavery movement from a discussion about gradually ending slavery into a moral crusade demanding ""immediate and complete emancipation."" A printer and editor, Garrison experienced his near-religious conversion to abolitionism around 1828 and founded the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833. At first, he was a lone, fierce, and unpopular voice; at one point, he was almost lynched in his hometown of Boston. But Garrison refused to back down: ""I will not retreat a single inch-and I will be heard!"" he thundered. His attack on slavery grew so fierce that he condemned the Constitution as a corrupt document for permitting it. Garrison's extremism was not shared by all, yet he and his growing number of followers forced the North to the previously radical proposition that slavery was both immoral and antithetical to the country's founding principles.

51920,"Louisa May Alcott began to write professionally in her teens when her father, utopian theorist Bronson Alcott, left the family in dire financial straits. She published her first book, Flower Fables, in 1854. After serving as a nurse during the Civil War, she produced the memoir Hospital Sketches in 1863. Asked by her publisher to write a book for girls, Alcott drew upon her own family experiences to write Little Women (1868). This heartwarming novel, chronicling the lives of the four March sisters-Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy-was a success at its publication and remains an American literary classic."
51929,"Script #AC015  Calvin Coolidge  1872-1933     Something about President Calvin Coolidge invited both verbal and visual parody. Historian Frederick Lewis Allen wrote that ""he was a meager-looking man, [who] was as silent as a cake of ice."" And when Dorothy Parker was told that Coolidge had died, she commented, ""How could they tell?""   Mexican-born illustrator Miguel Covarrubias created one of the more merciless caricatures of Coolidge for Vanity Fair. The scant details of the drawing-the unfilled wastebasket and bare desktop-tell as much about the president's lack of imaginative leadership and the emptiness of his political agenda as do the descriptions of his face.

52028,"Born Brooklyn, New York    Shirley Chisholm began her professional career as a teacher in New York City. But the racial and political acuity that her father fostered in her soon resulted in her increasing interest in politics. She served in the state’s General Assembly from 1964 to 1968. In the latter year, she became the first black woman elected to Congress when she won New York’s Twelfth District seat. There she became an advocate for women’s rights and civil rights, and spoke out against the Vietnam War. She was also a cofounder of the National Organization for Women. In 1972 Chisholm sought the Democratic Party’s nomination for the presidency. Although her bid was unsuccessful, her candidacy enabled her to raise issues of importance to African Americans and women and to forge the way for others. ""The door is not open yet,"" she said, ""but it is ajar."""
52040,"This Time cover, depicting Jimmy Carter as a western sheriff about to have a showdown with an unseen outlaw, was a distillation of the hapless situation that Carter confronted in the spring of 1980. Two of the most pressing concerns of the moment were the fifty Americans being held hostage by Muslim fundamentalists in Iran and the Soviet Union's armed interference in Afghanistan. To force the release of the hostages and make the Soviets back off from attempting to bring the Afghans under their influence, Carter wanted to take strong retaliatory measures. But in order to give those measures teeth, he needed the backing of America's allies, and  that support was not strong. Thus, Carter may indeed have been feeling like this holstered caricature of himself, marching to meet his foe, while his neighbors, who stand to benefit from his bravery, scurry off in search of refuge.    Time cover, April 28, 1980"
52061,"Born Castellaneta, Italy  In Hollywood’s silent era, Rudolph Valentino represented a different kind of male screen personality than the swashbuckling Douglas Fairbanks, known for his soaring roles as Zorro and Robin Hood. Valentino’s colossal breakthrough came in 1921 in Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, one of the first films to gross more than one million dollars at the box office. Audiences thrilled as his tango dancing exploded across the screen, igniting his own screen stardom and popularizing this street dance as America’s hottest new craze.  Valentino’s tango also illustrated how movies could spread social dance to a vastly larger audience than Irene and Vernon Castle’s Castle Walk ever reached in the teens. By the 1920s, media culture—movies, radio, recordings, magazines—gave vast audiences constant access to whatever was new. When the vogue for tango paled, the cultural pipeline would generate a new dance. Charleston anyone?"
52096,"Time magazine named Nikita Khrushchev, first secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, as its Man of the Year for 1957. It was a banner year for the Soviet leader: in October, the Soviets had launched Sputnik, the first manmade satellite to orbit the earth. Several weeks later, following a failed U.S. rocket launch, a second Sputnik circled the globe. Khrushchev also announced an intercontinental ballistic missile program, made credible by the successful space launchings, and bragged about higher production levels in agriculture and industry. Diplomatically, Khrushchev succeeded in achieving warmer ties with China, building a stronger network of allies in the Middle East, and halting the growing disaffection of the Eastern European nations. Russian born artist Boris Artzybasheff, who fled his homeland in 1917, depicted the Soviet leader wearing a self-satisfied expression and a Kremlin-shaped crown, and playing with his new Sputnik toy.  "
52104,"The Harlem Renaissance of the early twentieth century was a misnomer. Harlem had always been the capital of African America, with its own cultural and social traditions. What ""Renaissance"" actually connoted was whites’ discovery of African America and their grudging admission to allow the most talented blacks to cross the color line and gain a measure of acceptance, if not full social and political equality. Among poets, Langston Hughes was a trailblazer, not only for black writers but also for his ability to force his way into mainstream American literature. Although white intellectuals projected their racial fantasies and preconceptions onto African Americans, seeing them as a way of revitalizing a sterile culture by injecting a dose of the ""primitive,"" Hughes focused on a deep commitment to African American history, treating the subject with the framework of modernist poetry. As would be the case throughout the century, a marginal or excluded group would reinvigorate the culture because their doubleness—the sense of being ""in"" but not completely ""of"" American society—worked to their advantage as artists. Paradoxically, the story of twentieth-century culture was sometimes best told through the eyes of those whom the culture most disdained: women, gays and lesbians, and African Americans."
52208,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    Architect Thomas U. Walter won the competition to enlarge the United States Capitol and moved to Washington from Philadelphia in 1851 to supervise construction of his design for the building's new wings and cast-iron dome. Walter undertook other architectural projects for the federal government as well. He replaced Robert Mills as supervising architect of the Patent Office Building from 1851 to 1855, and was responsible for constructing the building's west and north wings. Despite claims to the contrary, Walter's system of construction was not fireproof, which had disastrous consequences when his Patent Office wings were consumed by fire in 1877."
52215,"Born St. Petersburg, Russia  George Balanchine studied at Russia’s Imperial School of Ballet but left in 1925 to join Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in Paris. After Diaghilev’s death, Balanchine co-founded Les Ballets, where impresario Lincoln Kirstein discovered him in 1933. Kirstein convinced him to help organize the School of American Ballet, which evolved into the New York City Ballet in 1948.  Once in America, Balanchine also became an important choreographer. His work included Hollywood’s first full-scale ballet in Goldwyn Follies (1938) and on Broadway, such musicals as On Your Toes and Cabin in the Sky. In this photograph, Balanchine holds a drill and a hammer—the tools of an artisanal laborer. It was the process of creation that mattered: “God creates,” he said, “and I assemble.”  From 1948 until his death, Balanchine choreographed more than 150 works for the New York City Ballet. Always emphasizing “the visual spectacle,” he proved that America could produce a ballet that was both indigenous and spontaneously brilliant."
52238,"Born near Easton, Maryland      In the years following his escape from bondage in 1838, Frederick Douglass emerged as a powerful and persuasive spokesman for the cause of abolition. Douglass’s effectiveness as an antislavery advocate was due in large measure to his firsthand experience with the evils of slavery and his extraordinary skill as an orator whose “glowing logic, biting irony, melting appeals, and electrifying eloquence” astonished and enthralled his audiences. Convinced that a peaceful end to slavery was impossible, Douglass embraced the Civil War as a fight for emancipation and called upon President Lincoln to enlist black troops in the cause. "
52335,"When President Richard M. Nixon opened a dialogue with Communist China in 1971, he began one of the most significant developments in modern diplomatic history. Ironically, it was this tough anti-Communist who prepared the way for a more flexible policy toward China. This caused a realignment of power in the Cold War world and enabled Nixon to pursue a less confrontational policy-détente-with the Soviets. ""It took Nixon to go to China"" has come to mean that only someone with a tough reputation can effect a reversal in policy. Notwithstanding Nixon's diplomatic breakthrough, he was criticized for being too self serving in describing his achievement. Mort Drucker's Time cover caricature of Nixon and Chinese leader Mao Zedong alludes to the U.S. table tennis team's famous 1971 visit to China, one of the first signs of a thaw between the two countries.  "
52352,"Thirty-fifth President, 1961-63    John F. Kennedy embarked on his White House responsibilities in January 1961 with a ""youth-can-do-anything"" outlook. He quickly discovered that confidence was not enough to ensure success, given the disastrous American invasion of Castro's Cuba and setbacks in Congress over his domestic agenda. Nevertheless, by the end of his first year, he had begun to establish his credibility as a world leader. Moreover, Kennedy's leadership style had matured as he acquired insights into the realities of the nation's highest office. It was that growth that prompted Time to name him 1961's Man of the Year and to commission this cover portrait from Italian painter Pietro Annigoni.  When Annigoni went to the White House to sketch Kennedy, he was struck by the president's pensive, often somber, demeanor, and it was this side of Kennedy that the artist decided to capture. Many readers of Time detested the final portrait, however, including the president himself.    Time cover, January 5, 1962"
52372,"Through his short stories and essays Bret Harte presented many Americans with their first taste of the society that the California Gold Rush had produced. In stories such as ""The Luck of Roaring Camp"" and ""The Outcasts of Poker Flat,"" Harte brought to life a colorful assortment of gamblers, miners, and other adventurers who, like him, had settled in California. Returning to the East in 1871, he found himself lionized as the West's signature writer. But Harte never felt any real kinship with the crude world he portrayed, and his later western stories paled in comparison to the crisply narrated tales that had made him a celebrity. By 1878 Harte was sailing for Europe, where even his lesser works continued to find an appreciative audience. There he remained for the rest of his life, grinding out hackneyed variations of his original themes and settings."
52423,"This photograph commemorates the meeting between the paleontologist Othniel Marsh and the Lakota chief Red Cloud in New Haven in 1883. While digging for fossils in Dakota Territory nine years earlier, Marsh observed and later reported to government officials and newspapers in the East the deplorable conditions and widespread corruption on several Native American reservations. Marsh had met Red Cloud on this trip and later invited him to visit his Connecticut home. The first professor of vertebrate paleontology in the United States, Marsh was a frequent member of western expeditions sponsored by the U.S. Geological Survey. The fossils he and his team of assistants collected helped to build important collections at the Smithsonian and at Yale University's Peabody Museum. During an era when Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection was hotly contested in America and abroad, Marsh was one of Darwin's earliest supporters."
52438,"Gertrude Stein's experimental writing style impressed Davidson. ""While I was doing her portrait, she would come around to my studio with a manuscript and read it aloud. The extraordinary part of it was that, as she read, I never felt any sense of mystification. 'A rose is a rose is a rose,' took on a different meaning with each inflection. When she read aloud, I got the humor of it. We both laughed, and her laughter was something to hear. There was an eternal quality about her-she somehow symbolized wisdom."""
52456,"At a critical juncture in the Vietnam War, President Lyndon Johnson summoned the U.S. ambassador in Saigon, Henry Cabot Lodge, to discuss the status of South Vietnam's government. Lodge is seated directly across from Johnson, who is flanked by Secretary of State Dean Rusk (left) and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. On Lodge's right, in the foreground, is Vice President Hubert Humphrey. The subject of debate was South Vietnam's use of force to control certain provinces, which undercut American plans for democratic elections. Lodge declared, ""Damn the torpedoes! The hell with it. Even if we haven't got a government in Saigon, let's keep going."" LBJ agreed, saying that even if democracy in South Vietnam were delayed, the U.S. could not allow Communist North Vietnam to defeat the South.  "
52471,"In the summer of 1876, sculptor Olin Warner tried to interest the two major political parties in commissioning busts of their presidential candidates to be replicated for campaigning. The Republican camp, which was having a hard time drumming up interest in the rather colorless Rutherford B. Hayes, took advantage of the proposal. At least one Hayes supporter pinned great hopes on the resulting likeness's ability to persuade a so-far doubting public that Hayes was ""a man of power."" The venture for replicating the bust on a large scale, however, never went very far, and only a few copies were ever made."
52493,"Born Atlanta, Georgia     Lucy May Stanton was best known for her impressionistic watercolor-on-ivory portrait miniatures. She lived mostly in Georgia, but studied art in Paris around the turn of the century. An advocate for woman’s suffrage, Stanton was also well known in the art centers of New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. She presents herself in this large-scale portrait, The Silver Goblet, in a forthright, no-nonsense pose, and displays her virtuosity in handling the watercolor medium. She followed the traditional technique of roughening the surface of the ivory so that pigment would adhere to it, but then tilted her workboard to move the flow of the washes. In “puddling,” an innovative wet-in-wet technique, she allowed broad pools of color to shift over the surface and then dry, leaving a rich texture. Stanton also designed this frame, a fine example of the Arts and Crafts style."
52533,"When Franklin Roosevelt died in 1945, his successor, Vice President Harry Truman, felt as if the weight of the world had fallen on him. Feeling woefully unprepared, he now had the responsibility for guiding the country through the final phases of World War II and the often-jolting adjustments to peace.  Elected to the presidency in his own right in 1948, Truman had his greatest impact in foreign policy. His most notable achievements included defeating Communist takeovers in Greece and Turkey and repelling the USSR's attempt to push the West out of Berlin. Truman also presided over implementation of the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe's war-torn economies-a strategy that may be the greatest triumph in the annals of American diplomacy.  The Vienna-born Greta Kempton was Harry Truman's favorite portraitist. Shortly after she finished what would become his official White House likeness in 1947, she began this portrait. The picture was finally completed in 1970, when former members of Truman's administration presented it to the National Portrait Gallery.  "
52571,"When Time magazine commissioned Jacob Lawrence to make a cover portrait of Stokely Carmichael in 1966, the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was the leading advocate of “black power.” While many artists turned to abstraction in the 1950s and 1960s, Lawrence developed ways to make figuration more powerful. Finding Carmichael “fiery, very active, and very much in command,” he depicted him in overalls, dressed for a voter registration drive, and added a stalking panther. The real impact of the image, however, comes from Carmichael’s large, expressive hand and black, masklike face.   While the angular rhythms, strong colors, and intricate patterns of Lawrence’s highly stylized figures appealed to a formalist art audience, his compelling narrative content, focusing on African American history and universal human struggles, lent an authenticity to portraiture that few could match. Time’s editors, apparently worried about Carmichael’s increasingly militant tone, never published the image."
52651,"James Meredith's effort to become the first African American to enroll at the University of Mississippi made national headlines in the fall of 1962. Despite a U.S. Supreme Court decision supporting his admission, Meredith was turned away three times. This photograph by Flip Schulke pictures the confrontation, on the third attempt, between Meredith, accompanied by Chief U.S. Marshall James McShane, and Mississippi's lieutenant governor, Paul Johnson (in fedora). Four days later, with the backing of federal authorities, Meredith was finally permitted to enroll, but not before the campus had been torn by rioting that left more than 160 injured and two dead. Following graduation, Meredith continued his activist crusade, organizing a 220-mile March Against Fear from Memphis to Jackson in 1966 to encourage voter registration.  "
52813,"Born Kirkbean, Scotland     Acclaimed in Paris after his spectacular victory in the August 23, 1779, ship-to-ship duel between the Bonhomme Richard and the British Serapis, John Paul Jones was “feasted and caressed” by highborn ladies, one of whom painted this miniature. “You have made me in love with my own Picture because you have condescended to Draw it,” the Scottish adventurer-turned-hero wrote to the married artist, enclosing a lock of his hair and the promise of “a Cypher for a key to our future correspondence.”   "
52892,"Literarily and temperamentally precocious, Edna St. Vincent Millay exemplified the spirit of the roaring twenties and the emancipation of American women. After a rebellious college career at Vassar, she moved to Greenwich Village, the center of avant-garde culture. Poetically, Millay was a Romantic, inspired by the ecstatic visions of Keats and Wordsworth; her first notable poem, “Renascence” (1912), spoke of a nature that “breathed my soul back into me.” Her famous quatrain “First Fig” (1920) celebrates sexual abandonment: “My candle burns at both ends; / It will not last the night; / But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends— / It gives a lovely light.” Millay’s romanticism was at odds with literary modernism, and her reputation has declined. For a while, however, she perfectly represented the age that she did so much to define. She won the Pulitzer Prize in 1923 for The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver."
53002,"Robert Frost was one of the few modern American poets who combined critical with popular acclaim. His best poetry was written in the 1920s and 1930s, as America was discovering its national and regional histories. Frost's poems about rural life in New England-""West Running Brook"" and ""Birches,"" for example-struck a chord because they were readable, yet imbued with larger questions about human nature, mortality, and man's fate. Frost liked to play the naive rustic, but he was a dedicated craftsman and America's last great formalist poet. Criticizing modern poetry, he said that writing poems without structure was like ""playing tennis without a net."""
53021,"Born Cawsons, Prince George County, Virginia  Against the wave of War Hawks who swept into Congress in 1811, John Randolph of Roanoke, congressman from Virginia, stood opposed. Randolph saw war with Britain as foolhardy, driven by land hunger rather than as a defense of American sovereignty. “We have heard but one word,” Randolph accused his fellow congressmen, “like the whip-poor-will . . . Canada! Canada! Canada!” An aristocratic and eccentric man who brought his hunting dogs into the House chamber, Randolph’s colleagues feared his sharp tongue; his biting speeches proved in some ways prophetic: “Gentlemen, you have made war. You have finished the ruin of our country. And before you conquer Canada . . . the Capitol will be a ruin.” With a brief interruption, he continued to serve in Congress until 1829. He was a financially successful slaveholder who defended the necessity of slavery but freed his slaves in his will. "
53047,"Raised in a strongly Christian fundamentalist environment, Nettie Fowler showed her commitment to philanthropy and moral duty after her marriage to industrialist Cyrus McCormick, inventor of the mechanical reaper. When Cyrus died, Nettie McCormick became an important business influence. She helped lead the McCormick Harvesting Company through the travails of the wheat market collapse in 1896 and into lasting significance as the company became known as International Harvester. She is perhaps best known as a philanthropist; she contributed to more than forty schools and colleges throughout the country, particularly to the McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago."
53237,"Depicting Ulysses S. Grant at a moment of repose with his most impressive horse, Cincinnati, Grant derived his fame as an equestrian not just from his heroism on the battlefield but from his command of horses off the battlefield. Able to tame the wildest horses, Grant had a kinship with these animals all his life. He acquired Cincinnati in 1863, after the Union victory at Chattanooga, and never let anyone else ride him except for Abraham Lincoln. This print demonstrates the mastery of horsemanship as a status symbol in the nineteenth century.   Ulysses S. Grant      En la representación de Ulysses S. Grant en un momento de descanso con su caballo más impresionante, Cincinnati, Grant obtuvo su fama como jinete no sólo de su heroísmo en el campo de batalla sino también de su dominio de los caballos fuera del campo de batalla. Capaz de domar a los caballos más salvajes, Grant tuvo una afinidad con estos animales durante toda su vida. Adquirió a Cincinnati en 1863, después de la victoria de la Unión en Chattanooga, y nunca dejó que nadie más lo montara, a excepción de Abraham Lincoln.

In Richmond, Maury set to work on the development of underwater torpedoes. Others before him had experimented with such electrically charged devices, but Maury was the first American to use them successfully in battle. Secretary of Navy Gideon Welles reported to Congress after the war that the federal navy ""had lost more vessels from Confederate torpedoes than from all other causes combined."""
53401,"Abbott Lawrence (right) was a preeminent figure in the development of the New England textile industry and in 1845 took the lead in the foundation of the mills at the Massachusetts site that bears his family name. He was also an early promoter of railroads, which he regarded as essential for the expanding national economy. Elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1834, Lawrence was a vehement critic of Andrew Jackson's veto of the recharter of the Bank of the United States. Lawrence is pictured here with fellow Whig Robert C. Winthrop (glasses in hand), his successor in Congress, who likewise opposed the Jackson administration and championed a protective tariff and internal improvements. A notable orator and scholar, Winthrop was often called upon to speak at commemorative events.  "
53424,"Born Adrian, Michigan  Norman Bel Geddes was an influential theatrical and industrial designer best known for his streamlined, aerodynamic creations. In 1916 he began designing stage sets in Los Angeles before moving to New York City, where he designed for the Metropolitan Opera and on Broadway. In the 1950s he created television studios for NBC. Bel Geddes’s industrial designs of the 1930s defined his futuristic style, which combined functionality with streamlining in a wide variety of products, including kitchen appliances, typewriters, cigarette and cosmetic cases, Toledo scales, and Philco radio cabinets. One of his largest projects was the Futurama he designed for the General Motors Pavilion at the 1939 New York World’s Fair, which depicted a model of a city in the near future. Bel Geddes advanced his design visions in magazine articles and books, including Magic Motorways (1940), which in part became a road map for the interstate highway system."
53565,"Armed with superb natural talent, a keen competitive spirit, and poise that set him apart from his rivals, Arthur Ashe made his way from the segregated playground courts of his youth to the pinnacle of the tennis world. Rated among the world's top-ten players while still in college, Ashe reached the number-one ranking in spectacular fashion in 1968. After capturing the U.S. amateur title, he served an astonishing twenty-six aces in the final to become the first African American man to claim the U.S. Open championship. Ashe went on to record multiple tournament victories, including his memorable triumph over Jimmy Connors at Wimbledon in 1975. Following a heart attack that forced his retirement in 1980, Ashe dedicated his energies to humanitarian causes. He became a leader in the fight against AIDS in 1992, after revealing that he had contracted the virus through a transfusion."
53581,"Robinson Jeffers is the American version of Great Britain’s D. H. Lawrence. Less subtle or modulated (certainly less overtly sexual), Jeffers is a poet of the elemental, both in nature and in people. His was the cultural critique of the enervating and destructive effects of civilization and the suppression of our “natural” instincts. Like Lawrence (or artists like Marsden Hartley and Georgia O’Keeffe), he was inspired by American Indians and their doomed resistance to the encroachments of so-called civilization. In “Hurt Hawks,” he writes of the “wild God” that is sometimes merciful. He continues, “You do not know him, you communal people, or you have forgotten him; / Intemperate and savage, the hawk remembers him.” This has a certain fin de siècle feel to it, both in its cultural critique and in its sense of Darwinian struggle. Americans’ passion for individual strength seems indelibly stamped in the national character. "
53638,"March against the Vietnam War, New York City  King watched with growing dismay as U.S. military involvement in Vietnam escalated throughout 1965 and 1966. He abhorred the war on principle and worried that national resources needed to combat poverty and advance the cause of civil rights were being consumed by the Pentagon. Both as a Nobel Peace Prize recipient and as the world’s foremost advocate for nonviolence, King felt compelled to take a public stand against the war.   In an impassioned address delivered at New York City’s Riverside Church on April 4, 1967, he denounced U.S. action in Vietnam, declaring, ""If America’s soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read Vietnam."" On April 15, King walked arm in arm with Dr. Benjamin Spock (left) and Monsignor Charles Owen Rice of Pittsburgh (right) as they and thousands of protesters marched from Central Park to the United Nations Plaza, where King addressed a mammoth antiwar rally."
53643,"Born Cherokee town of Tuskegee, eastern Tennessee  Sequoyah, the son of a Cherokee chief’s daughter and a fur trader from Virginia, was a warrior and hunter and, some say, a silversmith. For twelve years he worked to devise a method of writing for the Cherokee language. His syllabary of eighty-five symbols representing vowel and consonant sounds was approved by the Cherokee chiefs in 1821. The simple utilitarian system made possible a rapid spread of literacy throughout the Cherokee nation. Medicine men set down ceremonies for healing, divination, war, and traditional ball games; missionaries translated hymns and the New Testament into the native language; and in 1828 the Cherokee Phoenix, a weekly bilingual newspaper, began publication at New Echota, Georgia.   The original portrait of Sequoyah, commissioned by Thomas McKenney and painted by Charles Bird King, was destroyed by the fire that swept through the Smithsonian Castle building in January 1865. "

Sent back to the Mediterranean in 1815, Decatur intimidated the dey of Algeria into signing a treaty that ended demands for tribute and brought the Barbary Wars to a final close. Feted upon his return, Decatur offered the toast: ""Our country! In her intercourse with foreign nations may she always be in the right; but our country, right or wrong."" Mortally wounded in a duel, Decatur died with a sigh ""that it was not in his country's cause."""
53767,"Born Southampton County, Virginia    George Henry Thomas earned fame as “the rock of Chickamauga” for tenaciously holding his ground during a near-rout of Union forces on that Tennessee battlefield in September 1863. A southern-born officer who chose to remain with the Union army during the Civil War, Thomas graduated from West Point in 1840. He later saw action in the Mexican American War, where he served with distinction at the battles of Monterrey and Buena Vista. Thomas’s Civil War career was marked not only by his memorable stand at Chickamauga, but by his vital contributions to the Union victories at Chattanooga and Nashville. "

He is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Joe in both the stage and movie versions of Show Boat, singing ""Ol' Man River."" He stopped making films in 1942, explaining, ""The industry is not prepared to permit me to portray the life or express the living interests, hopes, and aspirations of the struggling people from whom I come."" Robeson's left-wing sentiments became a focal point of anti-Communism in the postwar era, and his American career largely came to an end. He lived abroad, returning to the United States for a farewell concert at Carnegie Hall in 1958; he lived his later years in seclusion in Philadelphia."
54120,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
54255,"The psychedelic posters emanating out of San Francisco in the mid-1960s became the visual symbol of the counterculture for youth across the country. Rock impresario Bill Graham capitalized on these new styles for events he organized for San Francisco's Fillmore West Auditorium. Victor Moscoso produced this Fillmore poster advertising popular blues performer Junior Wells in 1966. One of the few poster designers with academic art training-he had studied at the Cooper Union, Yale, and the San Francisco Art Institute-Moscoso generally found his art school background of little help in experimenting with poster styles. But some of his pioneering effects he credited in part to his color studies with Josef Albers at Yale. ""Hot"" colors in wild combinations, Moscoso realized, could ""load up the surface"" of his poster, creating an intensity that made the image vibrate optically."
54287,"By the early 1930s, newspaper columnist Walter Lippmann was well established as one of the country's most widely respected political commentators, and in 1933, as Franklin Roosevelt's New Dealers began to grapple with the worst depression in American history, what Lippmann had to say about their often controversial actions was followed with considerable interest. Early in the recent presidential campaign, he had dismissed Roosevelt as an ""amiable boy scout"" with little ""grasp of public affairs."" But in the wake of the New Deal's swift implementation of depression-healing measures, Lippmann was soon praising its innovative spirit. Among the most influential columns of his career was one written in defense of Roosevelt's decision to take the country's monetary system off the gold standard. Ultimately, however, Lippmann cooled to Roosevelt's activism, fearing that it was claiming too much control over private initiative.  "
54299,"Theodore Roosevelt's hand-picked successor to the presidency, William Howard Taft never truly aspired to the nation's highest office. But once elected in 1908, President Taft proved reasonably able, and in many respects his administration represented a continuation of the Progressive policies of his predecessor. Roosevelt came to view matters differently, however, and in the 1912 presidential contest, he launched a third-party candidacy that doomed to failure Taft's bid for a second term. Taft ultimately secured the post he most desired when Congress approved his appointment as Chief Justice of the United States in 1921.   Commissioned by the popular journal Everybody's Magazine to illustrate an article entitled ""Roosevelt-Taft-La Follette on What the Matter Is in America and What to Do About It,"" this portrait of Taft was later included in a special double issue of Camera Work devoted solely to Steichen's work."
54311,"Probably born in France     Englishman James Smithson commissioned this forthright portrait from a Belgian artist working in present-day Aachen, possibly as a gift for a family member. Always painfully aware of his uncertain status as an illegitimate child of the Duke of Northumberland, he focused on his scientific publishing in chemistry and mineralogy. In 1826 he penned his most unusual will, providing for the establishment of the “Smithsonian Institution, an Establishment for the increase & diffusion of knowledge among men.”"
54331,"Shortly after the United States entered World War I in 1917, General John J. ""Black Jack"" Pershing (a nickname derived from his command of black troops in the Tenth Cavalry) took command of the American Expeditionary Forces going to Europe. His background and temperament fit with this country's emergence as a world power. Within little more than a year, he transported America's first massive twentieth-century army to the European front, where it contributed substantially to the German defeat in November 1918. Pershing deftly commanded the army and successfully held his soldiers separate from the French and British, who saw them as little more than replacements for their own massive casualties. Upon his return home, Pershing was designated ""general of the armies""-a title that no one had held since Ulysses Grant.  "
54368,"Arizona’s silver-haired senator, Barry Goldwater, emerged in 1963 as a leading contender for the next year’s Republican presidential nomination; however, he struck a good many GOP faithful as too radically conservative. Many experts thought he would have to moderate some of his ideas to become a truly viable candidate for the White House. At least that was the subtlety in Robert Vickrey’s cover in June 1963, which shows a profile of Goldwater in the embrace of the trunk of an elephant, symbol of the Republican Party. Goldwater, however, refused to let go of his hardline conservatism in the national campaign of 1964 and suffered one of the most resounding defeats in the history of presidential elections. And looking back at his “no” vote for the landmark Civil Rights Act of that year, it now seems obvious that he was conspicuously out of step with the times.  Barry Goldwater  1909–1998     Con su distintiva cabellera plateada, Barry Goldwater, senador por Arizona, emergió en 1963 como uno de los principales aspirantes a la nominación presidencial republicana del año siguiente. Sin embargo, un buen número de seguidores de su partido lo encontraba demasiado conservador. Muchos expertos pensaban que tendría que moderar sus ideas para ser un candidato viable a la Casa Blanca. Por lo menos eso fue lo que sutilmente implicó Robert Vickrey en su portada de junio de 1963, donde aparece un perfil de Goldwater abrazado por la trompa de un elefante, el símbolo del Partido Republicano. Goldwater rehusó abandonar su conservadurismo de línea dura durante la campaña nacional de 1964 y sufrió una de las más sonadas derrotas en la historia de las elecciones presidenciales. Si consideramos que votó “no” a la trascendental Ley de Derechos Civiles aprobada aquel año, es obvio que estaba totalmente fuera de época.

54458,"Portraiture-from film stills to carefully crafted glamour shots by Hollywood photographers-was a principal form of publicity for the intensely private actress Greta Garbo. Since she refused interviews and public appearances, the studio released a steady stream of images for her many fans. Garbo's famous face and proud pose confront the viewer directly in this German poster for her 1933 film Queen Christina. She had readily agreed to star in a fictionalized account of the independent-minded seventeenth-century Swedish queen, who occasionally dressed like a man and ultimately abdicated her throne for greater religious, intellectual, and personal freedom. In the film, director Rouben Mamoulian used the beauty and mystery of Garbo's face in his final shot of Queen Christina standing at the prow of a ship, silently contemplating her future. Some writers likened her ""breathtaking and mystical expression"" to the Mona Lisa. "
54463,"Paul Colin and Le Tumulte Noir    The jazz age had taken hold in Paris and with it, le tumulte noir, an intense fascination with black culture. African sculpture had inspired such artists as Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso; African American ragtime and jazz stimulated avant-garde composers; dancers were captivated by the Cakewalk, the Black Bottom, and the Charleston. Many people perceived in non-Western art forms a ""pure"" and intuitive creative impulse, in contrast to the overrefined artifice of white European culture. African American expatriates fleeing segregation at home were welcomed.   In 1927 Paul Colin published his portfolio Le Tumulte Noir, featuring forty-five lithographs with pochoir, or stenciled, color, in an edition of 500. Colin's dynamic images were inspired by cubism and art deco modernism. Several lithographs directly evoke Baker's slim form, costumes, and energetic dancing. Others feature jazz bands, prominent white music-hall entertainers depicted as black, or amusing images of the French attempting new dances.    Le Tumulte Noir is not without racist overtones drawn from imagery prominent in American and European popular culture. Nonetheless, it does not just celebrate the ""primitive""; its tone is more admiring than condescending. "
54503,"Born Delaware County, Ohio    Affectionately called Old Rosy by his troops, William S. Rosecrans proved to be one of the North's best strategists early in the war. In July 1861, Rosecrans's brigade won the Battle of Rich Mountain, Virginia, thus securing a Union foothold in territory that would ultimately become the state of West Virginia. His ability to maneuver the enemy was especially evident in the western theater, where he commanded the Army of the Cumberland in the Battle of Stones River (Murfreesboro, Tennessee). At Chickamauga, Georgia, in September 1863, however, his army suffered disaster when one of his orders was misconstrued. This allowed the enemy to attack through a wide gap in the federal line. The mistake cost Rosecrans his command and virtually ended his active service in the war."
54525,"James Buchanan entered the White House in 1857 hoping to quell the mounting sectional rancor over slavery. But the events of his administration often had the opposite effect. The Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision, which denied Congress's power to ban slavery in the western territories, unleashed an unprecedented wave of anger in the North. When Buchanan supported pro-slavery forces in the Kansas Territory, that anger rose to a fever pitch. In response, the South's militance in defending slavery waxed ever stronger, and by the end of Buchanan's term, the long-feared specter of war was turning into a reality.  With the outbreak of hostilities in the spring of 1861, Buchanan became the object of vilification in many quarters. Among the milder expressions of anti-Buchanan feeling was the disposition of the version of this portrait that had been painted for the White House. When artist George Healy presented his bill for the picture, Congress refused to pay it, and many years passed before the White House acquired a portrait of Buchanan.  "
54537,"Born Laurel Branch, near Petersburg, Virginia      At six feet, five inches, Winfield Scott was a “God of War.” Young and arrogant, Scott emerged during the War of 1812, when new military leadership was desperately needed. “Shall war come at last,” he wrote, “my enthusiasm will be rekindled; and then who knows but that I may yet write my history with my sword.” His victory at Chippewa and his bravery at Lundy’s Lane quickly elevated him to hero status. Scott went on to become the commander of the American army, creating the forces that would fight the Mexican American and Civil wars. "

54548,"Signed by the Boston Red Sox in 1914, the muscular, six-foot two-inch, 150-pound Babe Ruth was a gifted pitcher who helped the Sox win championships, but in 1919 he shifted to the outfield to utilize his even more impressive skills as a fielder and batter. The next year, the Yankees paid the Sox $125,000 for Ruth, an enormous sum for the time. In his first year as a Yankee, Ruth hit an astonishing fifty-four home runs, more than any team in the American League. In 1923-the first season played in Yankee Stadium (""The House That Ruth Built"")-he had what he regarded as his best year and led the Yankees to their first of many World Series victories with three homers and a .368 batting average. Ruth's home-run records have been eclipsed, but many view him as the greatest ever to play the game."
54554,"Born on the upper Gila River, between what is now Arizona and New Mexico   Among the Apache Indians resisting white encroachments on their lands and way of life in the late nineteenth century, none was bolder or more unrelenting than Geronimo. A Bedonkohe Apache leader, he moved with his mother at an early age to Sonora and joined the southern Chiricahua Apache band led by Juh, a chief with whom he became associated. In the early 1850s, upon his return from a trading trip, he found his camp ransacked and his family massacred by Sonora soldiers. Vowing revenge, he raided persistently into Mexico and against U.S. Army troops, fighting the advance of the white American frontier and inflicting terror against white communities in parts of New Mexico and Arizona.   This image was taken from a larger photograph showing Geronimo and several of his followers in the Sierra Madre in 1886, just before he surrendered to the forces of General George Crook. "
54579,"A spontaneous recovery from a serious spinal injury convinced Mary Baker Eddy that illness was not real, and she built a new Christian theology on the idea that all reality was spiritual and all physical matter was an illusion. The cure for evil, especially sickness and disease, she wrote, would come about by spiritual means. By the 1890s Eddy had centralized her new religion of Christian Science in Boston. A national newspaper, the Christian Science Monitor, was established in 1908. Membership grew from almost 9,000 in 1890 to about 270,000 in 1936, and spread to Europe and Asia."
54593,"Civil War sheet music  Civil War music usually fell into one of several categories: songs to rally the troops, spirituals sung by enslaved peoples, songs sung by families at home, and songs that reflected the homesickness many soldiers felt. The sheet music covers displayed here commemorate the lives of Confederates Jefferson Davis, Simon B. Buckner, and Stonewall Jackson, and Union general Ambrose Burnside."
54686,"When Marilyn Monroe appeared on Time’s cover in May 1956, Boris Chaliapin had become Time magazine’s favorite cover artist for portraying alluring actresses of the cinema. His divas included Olivia de Havilland, Jean Simmons, and Tallulah Bankhead in 1948; Elizabeth Taylor in 1949; Katharine Hepburn in 1952; Audrey Hepburn in 1953; and Grace Kelly in 1955. Yet when it came to celluloid sensuality, Marilyn Monroe had become Hollywood’s favorite box-office draw. As Time’s cover story reported, ""Monroe is for the millions a figure of fantasy rather than flesh. She offers the tease without the squeeze."" Still, Chaliapin’s portrait of Monroe subtly captures a deeper character trait that was real and genuine under the mascara—her fawnlike vulnerability. One reader described it as ""that wistful appeal for something higher than physical attraction."""
54715,"Born Gambia, Africa     Phillis Wheatley was the first African American to publish a book and the first American woman to earn a living from her writing. This was no small feat, considering that she came to America as a slave. In 1761 the Wheatley family in Boston purchased her. A small child then, she was called Phillis after the name of the ship that transported her from Africa. Unlike most slaves, Wheatley had an opportunity for an education, and soon learned to read and began to write poetry. An elegy written for the celebrated evangelical minister George Whitefield caught audiences' attention in Boston and London, and prompted an English publisher to print her collection, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral (1773). This work drew the praise of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, and Voltaire, and contributed to her later manumission.   "
54719,"Helen Hayes began her theatrical career at age ten and was a seasoned actress by her late teens. But in response to the harsh criticisms of her performance in her first starring role in 1920, she embarked on a regimen of self-improvement, ranging from voice lessons to fencing instruction. The program worked wonders. By the late 1920s, she was one of the most admired talents on the American stage, and eventually she would become known as the ""First Lady of American Theater.""  Among the performances inspiring that exalted title was Hayes's portrayal of England's Queen Victoria in Victoria Regina, which opened on Broadway in 1935. In the photograph here, Hayes strikes a pose from the first scene, in which young Victoria is awakened to be told that she is now queen."
54720,"The comic duo of Clark and McCullough was born in 1905, when boyhood friends Bobby Clark and Paul McCullough teamed up to perform as clowning acrobats with a traveling minstrel show. A year later, the pair joined the circus and began perfecting a comic formula in which the cigar-chomping Clark played a likeable rascal to McCullough's hapless straight man. After six seasons under the big top, the comedy team made the successful transition to vaudeville and was soon earning kudos as top-flight comedians in a series of popular revues. Clark and McCullough debuted on Broadway in the Music Box Revue (1922) and went on to enjoy success in a string of hit shows that included Strike Up the Band (1930). In Steichen's portrait, the irrepressible pair appear costumed for their Strike Up the Band roles with Clark in his trademark painted-on ""spectacles."" "
54724,"Although the person is the product in most political posters, candidate Henry A. Wallace does not appear in Ben Shahn's 1948 poster for the Progressive Party. Instead, the poster focuses on creating negative, satirical images of Democrat Harry Truman and Republican Thomas Dewey. It was based on a much-publicized photograph of Vice President Truman playing a piano with actress Lauren Bacall lounging seductively on top. Substituting Dewey for Bacall, Shahn cast the political skills of both presidential candidates in a frivolous light, emphasizing the message that ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find"" in the two major parties. Shahn first produced a painting that served as the backdrop for Wallace's appearance at the Progressive Party's convention in July 1948. It was reproduced in the form of this beautifully printed lithographic poster and distributed nationwide, along with postcards of the image. "
54740,"To earn money for medical school, Pearl Primus worked one summer as a wardrobe assistant for a New York dance group and, in the process, discovered her own natural gift for dancing. Soon she was an aspiring dancer, dedicated to using her art for expressing the African American experience. By early 1943, she was giving her first concert, which featured Strange Fruit, a composition inspired by the mob lynchings of blacks in America. Forming her own company the following year, Primus later devoted much of her time to studying the dance traditions of Africa and the Caribbean and eventually earned a doctorate in anthropology. As a choreographer, performer, and teacher, her influence on modern African American dance was profound, but also significant was her impact on contemporary dance in general. "
54786,"Appointed Yale College's first professor of chemistry and natural history in 1802, Benjamin Silliman (trained in the law) went to Philadelphia, London, and Edinburgh for exposure to the world of science. Over the next fifty years, Silliman became renowned as an educator, influential as the founder and editor of the American Journal of Science and a popular national figure on the lecture circuit, entertaining audiences with drawings and demonstrations and providing assurances that discoveries in science need not threaten biblical teachings.  Silliman's portrait was painted in New York, where he was engaged in the fatiguing work of raising money to keep the finest mineral collection in America at Yale. He posed before breakfast-at six o'clock in the morning-for one and a half hours, and recorded that John Trumbull, his friend and uncle by marriage, ""painted very rapidly.""  "
54803,"Born Chicago, Illinois  Robin Williams was a madcap genius in performances of all types of entertainment, from stand-up to feature films. Known initially as a comedian, he surprised with his ability to play serious dramatic roles. His breakthrough came in the 1970s TV comedy Mork and Mindy; as the alien Mork, much of Williams’s dialogue was improvised, as would be the case in most of his comedic roles. Once established, Williams worked tirelessly in show business, going on to appear in many feature films, including Good Morning, Vietnam (1987), Dead Poets Society (1989), and Mrs. Doubtfire (1993); he won an Oscar for his role as the psychologist in Good Will Hunting (1997). He also did voiceover work in animated films and returned to television with The Crazy Ones (2013). Williams battle substance abuse for years; he made serious fun of his struggle in his comedic monologues. "
54833,"Born Brookline, Massachusetts    Bobby Kennedy, running for the Democratic presidential nomination, was shot and killed by assassin Sirhan Sirhan on June 5, 1968, after winning the California primary. This tragically ended one of the most interesting political careers in modern American history. Coming only months after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Kennedy's killing plunged an already dismal year of violence and confrontation into further darkness. The younger brother of President John F. Kennedy, Robert served as his attorney general and was then elected senator from New York. Kennedy entered the 1968 presidential race in opposition to the Johnson administration's Vietnam policy and as a progressive voice on urban and racial issues.    Gardner Cox began this portrait, a commission from the Department of Justice, in February 1968 but finished it after the assassination. A muted, reflective, and melancholy image-at odds with Cox's usual style-it was rejected as too informal."
54843,"When Franklin Roosevelt began serving in New York's state legislature in 1911, some observers declared him ill-suited to the rough realities of politics. But Roosevelt thrived on those realities; some two decades later, he was advancing from the New York governorship to the presidency.  Taking office against the bleak backdrop of the Great Depression, Roosevelt responded quickly to this economic disaster with a host of regulatory and welfare measures that redefined the government's role in American life. Among conservatives, the new federal involvement in matters traditionally left to the private sector was a betrayal of America's ideals. But in other quarters, Roosevelt's activism inspired an unwavering popularity that led to his election to an unprecedented four terms.  When Roosevelt sat for this portrait in 1945, his presidential concerns had long since shifted to guiding the nation through World War II. This likeness is a study for a larger painting-a sketch of which appears at the lower left-commemorating Roosevelt's meeting with wartime Allied leaders Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at Yalta."
54870,"Born Hardin County, Kentucky  Although personally opposed to ""the monstrous injustice of slavery,"" Abraham Lincoln was elected to the presidency in 1860 on a platform pledging opposition to the extension of slavery into the territories but non-interference with slavery in states where it already existed. Seven states, led by South Carolina, seceded from the Union before the president-elect had even embarked on his journey to Washington for his inauguration. Shortly after his arrival in late February 1861, Lincoln visited Mathew Brady’s Pennsylvania Avenue photography studio, where he posed for a portrait by the studio manager and cameraman, Alexander Gardner. An engraving derived from this likeness was soon published in the April 27, 1861, issue of Harper’s Weekly, providing the public with the first bearded image of the new president."
54994,"James Montgomery Flagg's portrait of writer Ring Lardner depicts an enigmatic ""professional humorist who sometimes smiled but never laughed."" Lardner's fiction was admired for its command of colloquial language and its non-idealized characters. ""I try to write about people as real as possible,"" he once wrote. Lardner's You Know Me, Al (1916), featuring the letters of a fictional rookie ballplayer, established the author's reputation and inspired a comic strip. This drawing appeared in a 1922 advertisement for the strip and was later published in a collection of Flagg's celebrity portraits. Flagg drew Lardner from life, deftly documenting his thin, downturned lips, heavy-lidded ""owl eyes,"" and angular nose and chin. The artist, best known for his Uncle Sam ""I Want You"" recruiting poster, succeeds in capturing that ""mask over his emotions,"" which disguised but did not diminish Lardner's keen wit."
55096,"Born Cresson, Pennsylvania  Robert E. Peary first became interested in the vast inland ice regions of Greenland while serving as a lieutenant in the U.S. Navy’s civil engineering corps. A reconnaissance expedition to that area in 1886 convinced him to make Arctic research his life’s work. After completing several expeditions, Peary wrote in his diary on April 6, 1909: ""The Pole at last. The prize of three centuries. My dream for twenty years."" His triumph was marred, however, by Dr. Frederick Cook’s claim of having reached the pole a year earlier. Cook—whose claim was later discredited—had, as ship’s surgeon, accompanied one of Peary’s early Arctic expeditions. In 1911, after the controversy subsided, Peary was voted the thanks of Congress and given a rear admiral’s pension. Still, questions have lingered over the precise scientific accuracy of Peary’s claims."
55130,"Born Florida, Missouri    ""His fame is imperishable,"" wrote the New York Times at the time of Samuel Clemens's death one hundred years ago this April. Using the pen name Mark Twain, Clemens had become one of this country's favorite satiric writers by the early 1870s, routinely making light of everyday human foibles. But it was the publication of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) that assured him a lasting place in American letters. Inspired in part by his own boyhood, these two tales set along the Mississippi River did more than capture the rhythms of youth in antebellum America. In these and other novels, Clemens examined with sardonic wit different tensions that underlay contemporary society, including the question of race. In later years, his success in this country and abroad was tempered by financial and personal setbacks and by a contempt for American and British imperialism."
55274,"Born Wayne County, Michigan    In the 1926 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Henry Ford coined the term ""mass production"" to characterize the manufacture of the Model T automobile. Ford's efficiency reduced car prices from around $900 in 1908 to $290 in 1927, when the last of 15 million units rolled off the assembly line. Although Ford's mass production doubled industrial workers' pay rates and shortened their work day by two hours, he bitterly opposed labor unions, spied on his employees, and even investigated their personal lives. Ford's anti-Semitism was a major stain on a man who many believed could have been president of the United States."
55376,"Forty-first President, 1989-93    This profile image, supposedly revealing the interior workings of George Bush's presidential mind, ran on Time's cover with the headline ""How Bush Decides"" to complement the magazine's report on how Bush was faring after six months in office. Time concluded that in spite of Bush's lack of new initiatives in either foreign policy or congressional legislation, he seemed to have a calm and steady grip on the job. Moreover, his qualities appeared to compare favorably with those of his Oval Office predecessors. Although, for example, he shared Ronald Reagan's stubborn adherence to principle, Time ventured that he also had a better understanding than Reagan of the need for compromise. But above all, Bush enjoyed being president. While he worked ""as hard at the job as Carter did,"" the magazine noted, he wore ""the office as lightly as Reagan.""

55456,"Admiral ""Bull"" Halsey was nearing sixty when the outbreak of World War II placed him in command of American naval operations in the South Pacific. Yet age did not diminish his effectiveness, and in the war against Japan he became a chief architect of such victories as the taking of Guadalcanal and battles of Leyte Gulf and Luzon in the Philippines. A man who had little patience with ""spit and polish"" regulations, Halsey sometimes came under fire for his improvisational methods. Nevertheless, no naval commander was more affectionately revered by subordinates than this squarely built maverick.  Halsey's portrait was the work of Albert Murray, who was a naval combat artist during the war. He remained in the navy for several years after the war and in that time completed a number of portraits of noted officers.  "
55474,"This group portrait serves as a valedictory moment for Grant’s staff, many of whom had served with him for most of the war. Grant was loyal to his men, and some would continue to serve him during peacetime and during his presidency. Orville Babcock (standing, extreme right) would become President Grant’s chief of staff and would be accused of corruption, casting a pall over the administration. Ely Parker (third from left), a Seneca Indian chief turned engineer and army general, wrote out the Union’s surrender terms as Grant dictated them at Appomattox. At the McLean house, Lee apparently noticed Parker and remarked that it was good to see a real American among the group. Parker reportedly replied quietly, “We are all Americans.”  Ulysses S. Grant y personal     Este retrato de grupo funciona como un momento de despedida para el personal de Grant, muchos de los cuales habían servido con él durante la mayor parte de la guerra. Grant era fiel a sus hombres y algunos hubieran seguido sirviendo con él durante el periodo de paz y durante su presidencia. Orville Babcock (parado, extremo derecho) se convirtió en el jefe de personal del presidente Grant y fue acusado de corrupción, lo que manchó la gestión. Ely Parker (tercero desde la izquierda), un jefe indio de la tribu Seneca que se había convertido en ingeniero y general del ejército, escribió los términos de la rendición de la Unión mientras Grant los dictaba en Appomattox. En la casa de McLean, Lee, al parecer, observó a Parker y comentó que era bueno ver a un verdadero americano en el grupo. Según se afirma, Parker respondió en voz baja: “Todos somos americanos”.

55508,"The Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s was fueled by community and racial pride led by cultural leaders in African American society such as author and poet Langston Hughes. Born and raised in the Midwest, Hughes was educated at Lincoln University (Pennsylvania) after leaving Columbia University, in part because of its racism. He lived in Harlem for most of his life.         Artistically, Hughes anticipated black separatism (even black nationalism) in work that dealt with the desperate predicament of African Americans. Not simply despairing, his poetry insisted on the dignity and beauty of African Americans: ""Beautiful, also, is the sun./Beautiful, also, are the souls of my people."" Beset by the contradictions and difficulties of being a celebrated black artist and a cultural radical in a segregated society, Hughes kept his homosexuality publicly hidden, although it runs through his poetry in coded and oblique messages of loneliness and fulfillment. "
55607,"Born Barnwell, South Carolina  Called “the Godfather of Soul,” James Brown developed a trademark stage show featuring a twenty-piece band and backup singers. His signature sound showcased staccato horns, big bass, and as one critic wrote, “an ability to ‘scream’ on key.”  His high-energy performances became the touchstone for other performers of his generation: Brown would grab the microphone stand, slide into a split, pop back up, pirouette, and then alternate pulsating knee landings with flashing footwork until he collapsed in a heap. His singers would drape a cape over him and begin to carry him offstage when—presto! He would throw off the cape and take his performance into an even higher gear.  Brown’s biggest hits included “Night Train,” “Papa’s Got a Brand New Bag,” and “Living in America.” He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986."
55671,"The artists Christian Schussele and Felix Darley created this apocryphal gathering of leading writers at Sunnyside, Washington Irving's Hudson River home, to honor the literary culture created by America's founding generation of writers. By making Irving the center of the image, the artists both glorify his career and at the same time celebrate the national culture. But in doing so, they made the writers too much alike. As a New York critic wrote, ""If [Irving] could have caught a glimpse of such a gathering . . . [he] would have dashed out of doors."" Nonetheless, the group portrait is an important summing up of an era in which American literature found its voice and created a vigorous national culture that a new generation-Walt Whitman, Mark Twain, Stephen Crane-would later enhance.  "
55857,"Born Portland, Oregon  In 1913 journalist John Reed attracted national attention with his sympathetic articles on the Mexican Revolution. Later, as a foreign correspondent, he was fired for his fierce denunciations of World War I, a criminal offense under the Espionage Act of 1917. Reed then went to the Soviet Union, met with Lenin, and joined the regime’s Bureau of Revolutionary Propaganda. On his return to America he wrote a dramatic eyewitness account of the Russian Revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World. It sold well and made him a national celebrity. In 1919 Reed organized the U.S. Communist Labor Party and later that year traveled to Moscow to gain the Soviet Union’s recognition. Unable to return to the United States because of the Red Scare, he died in Moscow and is buried in the Kremlin. Reed was celebrated sixty years after his death in Warren Beatty’s film Reds."
56099,"Born Madrid, Spain  One of the greatest sopranos of the nineteenth century, Adelina Patti moved with her family from Spain to New York at the age of four. Born into a family of musicians, Patti had exceptional talent. Her career as a touring opera star began at age eight and spanned more than half a century. In 1859 she debuted as Lucia in Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor at the Academy of Music in New York. Her 1861 Covent Garden debut in the role of Amina in Bellini’s La Sonnambula was a great success. Between the 1850s and the 1870s she toured the United States, South America, the Caribbean, and Europe. In the 1880s she sang increasingly in concerts, demanding the highest fees the opera world had ever paid. Composers of her time raved about her clear voice tone and effortless skill of execution.   This photograph, taken by Charles Reutlinger, won the first prize at the International Exposition of 1867 in Paris."
56189,"Born Abbeville District, South Carolina  With Henry Clay and Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun formed the “Great Triumvirate” of American politics during the antebellum period. Calhoun was a leading nationalist when first elected to Congress in 1810, but in the 1820s he began advancing strong arguments in favor of the rights of local and regional interests. In mounting a defense of minority rights within the context of majority rule, Calhoun articulated the theory of the original sovereignty of the states within the Union. His position was embraced by the southern states and ultimately served as the political and legal justification for secession in 1860 and 1861."
56197,"Paul Robeson united great talent with commitment to justice in a career that won him celebrity and respect throughout the world.  Educated at Rutgers University-where he was class valedictorian and a two-time football All-American-and Columbia Law School, he sought greater opportunity than the legal profession then offered African Americans. In 1925 Robeson established himself as an actor with his starring role in Eugene O'Neill's The Emperor Jones and also earned international acclaim for his concert performances of African American spirituals. For more than three decades, he traveled throughout the United States and Europe appearing on stage, in film, and in concert. Robeson became a committed socialist and worked actively against fascism both before and during the World War II. But after 1945, growing conservatism at home clashed with his strong support of left-wing political causes to curtail his American performing career."
56209,"Gertrude Stein is more known for her novels and her exploration of the relationship between word and image than she is for her poetry, which she wrote only episodically and without sustained attention. Yet as with her other artistic explorations, her poetry focused on the modernist concern of the relation (or non-relation) of a word to the thing. As she put it in one of her famous aphorisms: “rose is a rose is a rose is a rose.” Her poetry was also imbued with a pre-Joycean sense of stream of consciousness. The remarkable thing about Gertrude Stein is that she is one of the most influential literary modernists, and yet no one reads her anymore. Her writing—fiction and poetry—is unable to transcend her own fixation with the problem of the noun: her writing is a thing that needs verbs."
56329,"In both looks and attitude, John F. Kennedy influenced a generation of politicians, including the charismatic mayor of New York City, John Lindsay. Lindsay became mayor in 1965, just as the postwar boom slowed and as urban problems began to mount. Despite some failures, Lindsay was able to keep New York from the race riots that devastated other cities. So it was altogether appropriate that when Time profiled Lindsay in November 1968 its editors chose African American artist Romare Bearden to portray him. Bearden is one of the most important members of the second generation of the Harlem Renaissance. His work is highly spiritual, focusing on African American history. His collage of Lindsay shows the mayor besieged by the city’s problems, almost as if he is falling down a whirlpool, throwing his hands up in resistance—or surrender. "
56395,"The Republican Party Banner for 1860    In the 1860 presidential election, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine was nominated to run alongside Abraham Lincoln as the Republican Party's candidate for vice president. Ironically, in comparison to Lincoln's meager two-year experience as a U.S. congressman, Hamlin had served two terms in the House of Representatives and had been elected three times to the U.S. Senate. A staunch advocate of rights for black Americans, Hamlin proved to be a supportive vice president. In reality, however, he played no active role in the day-to-day business of the White House; at that time, executive protocol did not even include the vice president at routine cabinet meetings. Hamlin was content not to have been chosen to serve a second term, and he later described the vice presidency as a ""nullity."""
56418,"This portrait of John F. Kennedy was created for Time’s cover story about the new president’s recent trip to Europe to confer with French president Charles de Gaulle and the Soviet Union’s communist leader, Nikita Khrushchev, in Vienna. Kennedy’s talks with de Gaulle went reasonably well. The same could not be said about the meetings with Khrushchev, however, and Kennedy came away from them feeling chastened by his adversary’s bullying tactics.  The creator of this likeness was the popular artist René Bouché, who ideally liked to have three seven-hour sittings with his subjects. Yet Kennedy allowed him only two sessions at the White House, each lasting about two hours. Bouché’s greatest difficulty, however, was that during these truncated sessions Kennedy was always talking to his advisors and seemed constitutionally unable to sit still for more than a few seconds at a time.  John F. Kennedy  1917–1963     Este retrato de John F. Kennedy se creó cuando Time reportó el viaje que acababa de hacer el nuevo presidente a Europa para entrevistarse con el presidente francés, Charles de Gaulle, y el líder de la Unión Soviética, Nikita Khrushchev, en Viena. Las conversaciones de Kennedy con Gaulle transcurrieron bastante bien. Pero no puede decirse lo mismo de las reuniones con Khrushchev, y Kennedy llegó a sentirse humillado por las tácticas intimidantes de su adversario.              El creador de esta imagen fue el popular artista René Bouché, quien normalmente solicitaba tres sesiones de siete horas cada una con sus modelos. Kennedy le concedió solo dos sesiones de apenas dos horas en la Casa Blanca. Sin embargo, el mayor inconveniente para Bouché durante las truncas sesiones fue que Kennedy no dejó de hablar con sus asesores y era físicamente incapaz de posar tranquilo más de algunos segundos.

56419,"When you think of Bob Hope you instantly envision the jaunty irreverence of this consummate entertainer. Born in England and raised in Cleveland, Hope joined the vaudeville circuit as a teen. By the mid-1930s he was a fixture on radio and a star of such Broadway shows as Cole Porter's Red, Hot & Blue. He moved to Hollywood and by 1940 began the hugely popular series of ""Road"" movies, partnered with golf buddy Bing Crosby. Hope's commitment to entertaining U.S. troops from 1941 through the Gulf War was legendary. He received five special Academy Awards and, in 1985, a Kennedy Center Honors award."
56497,"When he resigned as secretary of defense in 1968, Robert S. McNamara had become the object of embittered criticism for his part in the escalation of the Vietnam War. Yet when Time ran its cover story on him in 1963, his leadership in reshaping and expanding the nation’s defense system was rapidly earning him a reputation as the “most efficient and effective” secretary in living memory.   McNamara posed for Robert Vickrey’s cover portrait at night—the only time he had free for such things. Never once, Vickrey recalled, did his subject show any interest in seeing the artist’s progress. The first time that he saw the finished likeness was on the magazine cover.  Robert S. McNamara  1916–2009     Al renunciar al cargo de secretario de defensa en 1967, Robert S. McNamara ya era objeto de recias críticas por su papel en el recrudecimiento de la guerra de Vietnam. Pero cuando Time publicó su artículo de portada sobre él en 1963, sus iniciativas para la renovación y expansión del sistema de defensa del país le estaban ganando una rápida fama como el secretario “más eficiente y eficaz” del que se tenga memoria.               McNamara posó para la portada de Robert Vickrey por la noche, su único momento libre para este tipo de cosas. Según recordaba Vickrey, su modelo jamás mostró interés en ver el progreso del retrato. La primera vez que vio la imagen terminada fue en la portada de la revista.     Robert Vickrey (1926–2011)  Témpera sobre cartón, 1963  Portada de Time, 15 de febrero de 1963"
56606,"Born Avon, South Dakota  George McGovern was a congressman and a senator from South Dakota, but he is best remembered for losing the 1972 presidential campaign to Richard Nixon. His crushing defeat in that election reshaped the American political culture, shifting more power to the right. McGovern had been heir to the prairie populism that was a feature of the Democratic Party’s liberalism. As he became more politically and morally opposed to the war in Vietnam, he made a run for the presidency. Capitalizing on the Democrats’ new primary procedures, which he had helped write, McGovern won an unlikely nomination. Larry Rivers’s campaign poster moves from a crossed-out sketch of President Nixon to a smiling photograph of McGovern, suggesting that the Democratic nominee could put the country’s scattered pieces back together."
56872,"A by-the-book, spit-and-polish career army officer, William Westmoreland earned distinction in both World War II and Korea, so his combination of combat experience and political savvy made him the logical commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam. But while Westmoreland presided over America's escalation of the war from 1964 to 1968, his military abilities became overshadowed by the politicization of the war. In fighting against a skillful enemy and waging a war whose goals, both military and political, were ill-defined, Westmoreland contributed to the domestic ""credibility gap"" by giving relentlessly upbeat progress reports, even as casualties mounted and troop levels grew from 100,000 to 500,000. He was replaced after the 1968 Tet Offensive, when a North Vietnamese attack on South Vietnam's cities shook American confidence in the war effort. Westmoreland subsequently served as army chief of staff from 1968 to 1972.  "
56902,"Throughout his career as a professional soldier, Zachary Taylor took no more than a passing interest in politics. But his victories at the battles of Palo Alto, Monterrey, and Buena Vista during the Mexican War changed all of that. In their wake, this ""rough and ready"" general became eminently ripe for elective office. Even if Taylor had wanted to, he perhaps could not have stopped the groundswell of determination within the Whig Party to elect him president in 1848.  Upon entering the White House, Taylor declared his intention to bring harmony to the Union. Yet his refusal to placate the South by allowing slavery in some of the new territories acquired during the Mexican War did quite the opposite. Within a year of Taylor's coming to office, the country seemed to be moving toward civil war. Only after his unexpected death in July 1850 did compromise on this divisive issue become possible."
56945,"One of the Confederacy’s most successful female spies, Rose O’Neal Greenhow was a prominent Washington widow and a staunch southern sympathizer. The Confederacy recruited her as a spy after war erupted in 1861. Most notably, Greenhow is credited with passing along intelligence prior to the First Battle of Manassas, insuring a southern victory. Soon after, her covert activities were uncovered and she was placed under house arrest. Gardner took this photograph after “Rebel Rose” and her daughter, Little Rose, were transferred to the Old Capitol Prison in 1862. Greenhow served five months before being exiled to the South. She then traveled to Europe to promote the Confederate cause. Returning in September 1864, Greenhow drowned attempting to run the federal blockade of Wilmington, N.C. The Confederacy buried her with military honors."
56963,"Born New York City  Theodore Roosevelt was one of the most vibrant and dynamic figures in American history. Highly opinionated and calculating in his self-presentation and public statements, Roosevelt took part in the debate on modernism, throwing his voice into the reviews of the Armory Show. In his famous critique of the show, titled ""A Layman’s View of an Art Exhibition,"" he denounced the artists he labeled ""extremists"" by focusing on the Cubists: ""In this recent art exhibit, the lunatic fringe was fully in evidence, especially in . . . the Cubists."" While Roosevelt’s criticism of the show was inconsequential in terms of shaping the direction of the art world, his review is important for what it reveals about his view of the arts as an essential component of national identity and the charged political nature of the Armory Show.   Charles Dana Gibson’s portrait of Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, published in the January 1899 issue of Scribner’s, illustrated the first installment of Roosevelt’s memoir, ""The Rough Riders."""
56991,"Born Waterbury, Connecticut  The co-founder of the American Ballet Theatre in 1940, Lucia Chase had been a leading ballerina before she was inspired to create a ballet company that would represent “an American ethic.” Time magazine noted her success in 1955: ABT had “kicked new life into the mummified remains of classical ballet . . . and pioneered an electric, freshly dramatic modern style” by premiering such American-themed works as Agnes de Mille’s 1948 Fall River Legend.  One of the company’s great strengths under Chase’s guidance from 1940 to 1980 was its ability to showcase the works of artists from Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins to Mikhail Baryshnikov and Twyla Tharp. When President Jimmy Carter awarded Chase the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1980, he emphasized her dedication to “win for American talent its rightful place on the international stage of dance.”"
57009,"After the sudden death of Warren Harding on August 2, 1923, Calvin Coolidge’s father, a Vermont farmer who served as the rural district’s justice of the peace and notary public, swore his son in as America’s thirtieth president. Coolidge (1872–1933) had attained national celebrity in 1919 when, as governor of Massachusetts, he broke the Boston police strike, declaring that ""there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time."" At the 1920 Republican convention, over the objection of party leaders, he was made the vice-presidential nominee by acclamation. "
57085,"Born Chicago, Illinois      Walt Disney launched his long moviemaking career in 1928 with the animated Mickey Mouse cartoon Steamboat Willie. It was an instant success and led to many other cartoon shorts. Moreover, it also paved the way for Disney’s groundbreaking feature-length cartoon Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937), the first of his many animated classics that eventually included Bambi (1942) and Cinderella (1950). By the 1950s, Disney’s name was known to virtually every child in America. At the end of his life he had won more Academy Awards than any other filmmaker.  This photograph of Disney with two of his famous cartoon characters, Mickey and Minnie Mouse, was the work of Edward Steichen, who at the time was chief photographer for Vanity Fair. When the picture appeared in the magazine, it carried a caption that referred to Mickey as “the first and last of the red-hot rodents.”"
57095,"Born into a wealthy mercantile family, Samuel Smith distinguished himself in battle during the American Revolution. Afterward, he enjoyed a successful business and political career in Baltimore. In the 1790s he built a political machine in Maryland and won a Senate seat in 1803. He broke with the Jefferson administration over its Embargo Act, favoring a strong navy over the administration’s policies of commercial restrictions. When war was declared against Britain in 1812, he became commander of Maryland’s Third Militia Division. To his lasting credit, Smith organized Baltimore’s defenses against the expected British naval and land attack. On September 11, 1814, Smith’s militia, under the command of General John Striker, met British forces approaching from North Point. The militia’s strong resistance and the British failure to subdue Fort McHenry ended Britain’s Chesapeake campaign and made Smith a national hero."
57105,"Born New York City     Elizabeth Seton, the founder of the American Sisters of Charity, was the country’s first native-born Roman Catholic saint. Married with five children, she was widowed at an early age. After converting to Catholicism, she formed a sisterhood and began opening a series of schools and orphanages. Seton was elected as the first Mother Superior of the Sisters of Charity, which was established in 1809 in Emmitsburg, Maryland. Devoted to her family and friends, Seton sent copies of this small portrait by French émigré artist Saint-Mémin to loved ones, noting that the engravings portrayed “not the lively animated Betsy Bayley, but the softened matron with traces of care and anxiety upon her brow.” Seton’s enduring legacy included numerous communities of the Sisters of Charity, a mission of education and social work, and prolific writings. She was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1963 and canonized in 1975. "
57213,"English or American? Wystan Hugh Auden immigrated to America in 1939 already established as a major voice in English literature; he became an American citizen in 1946. For Auden, though, it was not a matter of trading one nation for another. Rather, America represented a free space into which he could escape, both as a gay man and as a poet, from the constrictions of English society. America became his subject, though. The sense in reading Auden is always of a tremendous mind ranging over a series of questions from the eternal to the picayune. If he argued that poetry made nothing happen, he meant it as high praise. It was poetry’s existence above the world that made it artistically important. America is where Auden lived—poetry was his country."
57224,"Diane Arbus began her career specializing in fashion. Ultimately she came to hate the work and in the late 1950s began to pursue portrait photography. Arbus took her likenesses in venues that were part of her subjects' daily lives. Rather than heroicizing these figures, she created photographs that seemed calculated to expose her subjects' vulnerabilities. That sort of candor did not please everyone. However, by the time Arbus took her own life in 1971, her work had found many admirers, and she is widely considered one of the most original portraitists of her time.  It is thought that this picture was taken in Central Park after a Vietnam War protest. Arbus's grim concentration, combined with the daffodil clenched in her mouth, creates a droll impact suggestive of her many tricks for making subjects drop their defenses before her camera."
57261,"During the 1820s, the religious movement called the Second Great Awakening was particularly powerful in upstate New York, an area known as the ""Burned Over District"" for the fierceness of its revivals. Amidst this fervid religiosity, young Joseph Smith in 1830 founded what came to be known officially as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or more informally as the Mormons, after a book he said he translated, the Book of Mormon. Smith urged his followers to gather into communities that by their size and cohesiveness threatened other citizens, leading to antagonisms and ultimately forced evictions. In 1839 they settled in Commerce, Illinois, which they renamed Nauvoo. After five years, opposition to the Mormon presence grew, as did challenges to Smith's leadership from political opponents and Mormon dissenters. After he closed down an opposition newspaper, he was imprisoned, where he was attacked by a mob and murdered."
57262,"In a postwar opera world that needed stars, Maria Callas was said to have ""restored the ancient luster to the title of prima donna."" Born in New York and raised in Greece, Callas, by sheer force of personality and artistry, rejuvenated the public's interest in this classic music genre. She created renewed attention to the bel canto works of Bellini and Donizetti, and influenced the next generation of singers, including Beverly Sills, Joan Sutherland, and Marilyn Horne. Part of Callas's cachet was her volcanic temperament-""I will always be as difficult as necessary to achieve the best""-which ultimately found her fired from the Metropolitan Opera and ostracized by the Chicago Lyric, among other companies. Her box office quotient was so high, however, that most eventually welcomed her back."
57274,"Inaugurated in January 1969, Richard Nixon was slow in setting a national agenda, but after seven months, Time thought that the tempo was definitely picking up at the White House. While reviving good relations in Europe with a recent tour of NATO’s capitals, Nixon was making strides on a number of other fronts as well, not least of which were his proposals for federal revenue-sharing and welfare reforms.   For this August 15 cover, celebrated cartoonist Pat Oliphant transformed Nixon into a laid-back surfer, which was a reference to the president’s current sojourn at his San Clemente, California, retreat. Among the figures surrounding him are Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird hugging an antiballistic missile (far left); conservative senator Strom Thurmond signaling Nixon to move right (lower center); and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev glowering at Romanian president Nicolae Ceauşescu for the latter’s friendly meeting with Nixon (lower right).  Richard M. Nixon  1913–1994     Richard Nixon, investido presidente en enero de 1969, tardó en establecer una agenda nacional, pero después de siete meses Time pensó que la Casa Blanca estaba tomando impulso. Mientras revivía las buenas relaciones con Europa en una gira por las capitales integrantes de la OTAN, Nixon hacía avances en otros frentes también, entre ellos la distribución de los ingresos federales y las reformas de bienestar social.               Para la portada del 15 de agosto, el célebre caricaturista Pat Oliphant transformó a Nixon en un relajado surfista, en alusión al descanso que tomaba el presidente en su casa de San Clemente, California. Entre las figuras que lo rodean están el secretario de defensa Melvin Laird abrazando un misil antibalístico (extrema izquierda); el senador conservador Strom Thurmond indicando a Nixon que se mueva hacia la derecha (abajo al centro); y el líder soviético Leonid Brezhnev furioso con el presidente rumano Nicolae Ceauşescu por haber sostenido una amistosa reunión con Nixon (abajo a la derecha).

57331,"In the battle for civil rights, timing was everything. “Stronger than all the armies is an idea whose time has come,” proclaimed Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, borrowing the words of Victor Hugo. In his own words, spoken with his characteristic hoarse eloquence, he elaborated: “The time has come for equality of opportunity in sharing in government, in education, and in employment.” Dirksen was addressing the full U.S. Senate and its packed galleries just minutes before a vote on cloture, which ended a long filibuster by a bloc of southern Democrats. The successful vote all but ensured passage of the historic Civil Rights Bill, which President Lyndon Johnson signed on July 2, 1964. Time chose Dirksen for its June 19 cover story in recognition of his adroit leadership in rallying his fellow Senate Republicans behind a compromise bill, largely crafted by his oversight.   Everett Dirksen  1896–1969     En la batalla por los derechos civiles, reconocer el momento oportuno resultó crucial. “Más fuerte que todos los ejércitos es una idea cuya hora ha llegado”, declaró el líder de la minoría en el Senado, Everett Dirksen, evocando las palabras de Víctor Hugo. Y añadió con su típica ronquera y elocuencia: “Ha llegado la hora para la igualdad de oportunidades de participación en el gobierno, la educación y el trabajo”. Dirksen se dirigió así al pleno del Senado y a las abarrotadas galerías antes de proceder a la votación que pondría fin a una larga obstrucción filibusterista llevada a cabo por un bloque de demócratas del sur. El exitoso voto aseguró la aprobación de la histórica Ley de Derechos Civiles, firmada por el presidente Lyndon Johnson en julio de 1964. Time escogió a Dirksen como sujeto de su artículo principal en la edición del 19 de junio en homenaje al hábil liderazgo que ejerció para recabar el apoyo de sus compañeros senadores republicanos a una versión modificada de la ley, en gran medida escrita bajo su supervisión.

57378,"Born Michigan City, Indiana    In the 1956 championship series pitting the New York Yankees against the Brooklyn Dodgers, Yankee hurler Don Larsen entered the record books by pitching the first and only perfect game in World Series history. With the series even at two wins apiece, Larsen took the mound for game five and, inning by inning, proceeded to retire each Dodger batter he faced. In the top of the ninth, with two outs and the count on pinch hitter Dale Mitchell standing at one ball and two strikes, Larsen unleashed a pitch that zoomed over the plate for a called third strike to end the game. By retiring twenty-seven consecutive batters without allowing a single hit or base on balls, Larsen had achieved pitching perfection. In this dramatic image, press photographer Arthur Rickerby not only captured Larsen's delivery of the game-winning pitch but preserved the perfect game tally on Yankee Stadium's centerfield scoreboard. "
57394,"In 1822, Stephen F. Austin led a group of Anglo-American emigrants to settle a site in Texas on the Gulf of Mexico. He gained the cooperation and trust of the newly formed Mexican state, which saw Austin's colony as a way to settle and improve its lands. For ten years Austin led the colony and grew to believe that Mexico, not the United States, should control Texas. However, his hand was forced when the Mexican government, fearing the American colonists' independence, began to harass them. Austin was arrested in 1835 for allegedly plotting to annex Texas from Mexico. Released, he joined the subsequent revolt as commander of the army of Texas. After the declaration of the Republic of Texas (1836), Austin was defeated as its first president by Sam Houston, the war's military hero.  "
57509,"When Vice President Chester Arthur succeeded to the presidency on the death of James Garfield, a newspaper noted that he was ""not a man who would have entered anybody's mind"" as a worthy candidate for the office. Indeed, as a major player in a spoils system that reduced the civil service to a vehicle for rewarding party faithful, he struck many as an emblem of all that was wrong in American politics.  As president, however, Arthur rose above his past to promote landmark legislation designed to curb the spoils system. He also proved to be a foe of other forms of corruption. When, for example, a ""pork barrel"" bill for public improvements reached his desk, he vetoed it.   This head-and-shoulders portrait can only hint at the fashionable figure that Arthur cut. With his muttonchop whiskers ""trimmed to the perfection point"" and his suits made of only the finest fabrics, he invariably looked like the very epitome of the well-bred Victorian gentleman.  "
57594,"The 1920s yielded a bumper crop of stellar athletes-Babe Ruth in baseball, Bobby Jones in golf, Red Grange in football. And in women's tennis it was Helen Wills Moody. Nicknamed ""Little Miss Poker Face,"" Moody played with a deadpan calm that did not engender much excitement. She knew how to win, however. Beginning in 1923, when she claimed her first American singles title, she dominated women's tennis for more than a decade. The number-one women's player for eight years running, she won 180 straight matches between 1927 and 1933. When she retired in 1938, her triumphs included eight singles championships at Wimbledon, four at the French Open, and seven at the American.  Moody is pictured here playing an early match in the United States Open of 1933, where she faced Helen Jacobs in the finals. "
57650,"Adalbert Volck began his Sketches from the Civil War with this comprehensive indictment of the Union cause, titled Worship of the North. Gathered around an altar built of bricks labeled ""Puritanism,"" ""Witchburning,"" ""Negro Worship,"" and ""Free Love"" are a host of villains responsible for the crusade against the South. As a devil-like Lincoln presides to the right of the altar, abolitionist clergyman Henry Ward Beecher directs his knife toward the white victim being sacrificed to a black idol. While New York Tribune editor Horace Greeley swings incense in the left corner and, behind him, Republican senator Charles Sumner holds a torch to guide Beecher’s knife, a crowd of other northern luminaries looks solemnly and prayerfully on. Underscoring the Confederacy’s commonly held conviction that the North was making war on the South as much for profit as for slave liberation, overfed representatives of ""The Holy Cause of the Contractors"" stand barely visible in the far right background."
57651,"Volck imagines a look inside a slave hut as the master, holding a pistol, hides behind the front door while an enslaved woman diverts inquisitive Yankee soldiers in another direction."
57720,"Born Cape Girardeau, Missouri  ""Is Rush Limbaugh Good for America?"" ran the headline of the 1995 Time magazine cover story about the colorful radio personality. One of the most prominent talk show hosts of our era, Limbaugh has defined himself as a social and political conservative, prone to strident, and sometimes outrageous, comments to assert his point of view. Wafting cigar smoke and sporting a boldly colored tie, Limbaugh’s appearance matches the combative persona he nurtures on air. Author of The Way Things Ought to Be (1992) and See, I Told You So (1993), Limbaugh has repeatedly criticized examples of what he perceives as liberal bias, contributing to a lively and ongoing debate about the intersection of politics and personal beliefs, and suggesting that indeed Limbaugh is an effective force for civic debate in this country."
57765,"  This three-part photograph shows eight members of the 1868 Ute delegation to Washington, D.C., standing alongside nine government officials. Because of growing complaints about settlers trespassing on traditional Ute lands, this group came together ostensibly to establish a definable Ute reservation in Colorado. Fourth from the right is Ouray, the individual whom U.S. authorities regarded as the tribe's principal spokesman. Fluent in English and Spanish, Ouray was best able to communicate with federal officials. His close association with Kit Carson-who traveled with the delegation but is not pictured here-and his reputation for being cooperative also made him the person with whom negotiators most wanted to deal. Although he was an important leader, Ouray had no such negotiating authority. Nevertheless, a treaty was signed during the Utes' visit that secured a relatively generous land apportionment. For the remainder of his life, Ouray struggled, often unsuccessfully, to have U.S. authorities honor the terms of this treaty."
57878,"During the 1920s and 1930s, the glamorous husband-and-wife team of Ely and Josephine Culbertson succeeded in transforming bridge from a parlor game into an international phenomenon. Already accomplished players when they married in 1923, the duo enjoyed spectacular success on the tournament circuit with their unconventional bidding methods and playing strategies pioneered by Ely. When contract bridge was introduced in 1926, Ely seized the opportunity to establish himself as the new game's foremost expert and practitioner. After launching The Bridge World magazine in 1929 and publishing his bestselling Contract Bridge Blue Book the following year, Culbertson partnered with his wife to score victories in a series of high-profile matches at home and abroad. The unprecedented media coverage of these contests made the Culbertsons international celebrities and ignited a contract bridge craze that remained unabated for more than a decade."
57882,"A highly educated and enlightened thinker, John Adams gained valuable political experience while serving in diplomatic positions in France and Holland during the Revolutionary War. Afterward, he was appointed the first American minister to the Court of St. James's (1785-88) before returning to the United States to serve as vice president (1789-97) and later as president (1797-1801). Early in his term, Adams exhibited an awareness of the potential problems that Spain's presence in America could cause for the young nation. In his first State of the Union address, he informed Congress that despite the agreements reached two years earlier in the Pinckney Treaty, Spain continued to maintain a military presence in American territory near the Mississippi and that the demarcation of borders had yet to commence. He also accurately predicted hostilities with the Native Americans, who deterred attempts to establish the boundaries prescribed by the 1795 treaty.      Pensador sumamente educado y de lúcida inteligencia, John Adams ganó una valiosa experiencia política mientras servía en puestos diplomáticos en Francia y en Holanda durante la Guerra Revolucionaria.  Adams fue, además, el primer norteamericano que recibió el nombramiento de ministro de su país ante la Corte de St. James's (1785-88). Regresó luego a los Estados Unidos para servir primero como vicepresidente (1789-1797) y luego como presidente (1797-1801).  Desde el principio de su presidencia, Adams mostró una aguda conciencia de los problemas que la presencia de España en Norteamérica podría causarle a la joven nación.  En su primer discurso sobre el Estado de la Unión, Adams informó al Congreso que, a pesar de los acuerdos conseguidos dos años antes en el Tratado de Pickney, España seguía manteniendo su presencia militar en el territorio norteamericano que bordeaba el Mississippi, y que la demarcación de las fronteras estaba todavía por hacer. Adams pronosticó también con precisión las hostilidades con los indígenas, que impidieron los esfuerzos del gobierno para establecer los límites prescritos en el Tratado de 1795."
57926,"Born Great Barrington, Massachusetts  In 1903 William Edward Burghardt Du Bois famously declared that ""the problem of the Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line."" He uttered this prophetic statement understanding, perhaps better than anyone, the social and political standing of African Americans at the beginning of the new century. Having received a Ph.D. from Harvard in 1895, Du Bois focused his extraordinary intellectual energies on studying the question of race in America. The author of more than twenty books, he was also an activist and helped to found the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1910. Du Bois came to oppose the policy of political conservatism and racial accommodation favored by Booker T. Washington, insisting that African Americans receive full civil and political rights. His activism extended well beyond the United States and prompted him to move permanently to Ghana in 1961."
57983,"If John C. Calhoun was the South's leading advocate of states' rights, New England's Daniel Webster was easily its most celebrated opponent. Endowed with an imposingly broad brow that seemed to underscore his eloquence in the Senate and courtroom, Webster was unmatched in his gift for speaking. In 1830 he held his audience enthralled as he turned an exchange with South Carolina senator Robert Hayne into a debate over states' rights. Ending his oration with ""Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable,"" he left his listeners spellbound, and it was many minutes before any dared to speak. From that moment, Webster was for many a living emblem of national unity.   Francis Alexander painted this portrait in 1835 to commemorate Webster's role in an 1818 Supreme Court case that protected Dartmouth College's charter from being negated.  "
57993,"Davy Crockett was his own best public relations director. In the 1830s and 1840s, a series of almanacs was published carrying Crockett's motto ""Go Ahead,"" celebrating his larger-than-life adventures. Here he is wearing his distinctive coonskin cap."
58024,"Convinced that political action was the key to black empowerment, civil rights activist Bob Moses played a critical role in the effort to register African American voters in the Deep South in the early 1960s. As field secretary for the newly formed Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, Moses initiated SNCC's first black voter drive in Mississippi in 1961 and pioneered programs in which adults received tutoring in registration techniques and voting mechanics. Moses's most ambitious undertaking was the ""Freedom Summer"" campaign of 1964-a massive voter registration and education initiative that brought to Mississippi hundreds of volunteers, including white college students, who worked to expand black voter rolls; organize a ""Freedom Democratic Party"" to counter the state's whites-only Democratic Party; establish ""Freedom Schools"" to teach literacy skills, civics, and black history; and open community centers to provide medical services and legal aid."
58040,"Seemingly the heir apparent to Eisenhower, Richard Nixon trod a path to the presidency that was far from smooth. While admiring Nixon's intelligence and political skills, Ike viewed him as too combative. After Ike decided to run for a second term, he shocked Nixon by suggesting he take a cabinet position to gain executive experience. Although Nixon convinced Eisenhower to keep him on as vice president, he was deeply hurt. During Nixon's 1960 presidential campaign, Ike's contributions were minimal, and at times detrimental. When asked about Nixon's contributions to the administration, Ike responded, ""If you give me a week, I might think of one."" He immediately regretted his answer, which was really an expression of his irritation over being repeatedly asked that question. The question was also a blow to Eisenhower's considerable ego; the president took offense at the suggestion that anyone but him was responsible for his administration's successes."
58091,"Stereo view of Walt Whitman    Whitman venerated two ideals-the individual and the Union. He never lost confidence in the former but became increasingly disillusioned with the state of the latter. The purity of the Union's cause, in Whitman's thinking, had become corrupted by the political and economic machinations of Reconstruction and the Gilded Age. In Democratic Vistas (1871) Whitman lamented that:    Never was there, perhaps, more hollowness of the heart    than at present. . . . The spectacle is appalling. We live in    an atmosphere of hypocrisy throughout. . . . I say that our New    World democracy . . . is, so far, an almost complete failure.  Yet Whitman was confident that America was still unformed and would be reformed and redeemed through the goodness and perfectibility of the individual.   This photograph was used as the frontispiece of Whitman's Two Rivulets (1876)."
58176,"Born St. Joseph, Missouri     As managing editor and anchor of the CBS Evening News, Walter Cronkite played a key role in the development of network news shows that influenced the public opinion of a generation. His style and demeanor earned him the trust and respect of many Americans. When he visited Vietnam in 1968 and called the conflict a stalemate, President Lyndon Johnson told an adviser, ""If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America."" In times of great joy or sorrow in our nation, his mood mirrored what many Americans felt. Struggling to maintain his composure, he broke the news of President Kennedy's assassination in 1963, and whooped with joy during successful NASA missions.   Robert Vickrey, who drew Time's 1966 cover portrait, only saw Cronkite in black and white on his television and incorrectly made his eyes brown. He later corrected the drawing with the most vivid blue he could conjure. "

58280,"In Memoriam  Mickey Rooney 1920–2014  Born Brooklyn, New York  Judy Garland 1922–1969  Born Grand Rapids, Minnesota  Born into a vaudeville family, Mickey Rooney took the stage as a toddler and began making movies at age five. In a ten-decade career, he made more than 300 films, ending with The Muppets (2011).   A Family Affair (1937), the first of nearly twenty Andy Hardy movies, launched Rooney as the top box-office star in 1939, 1940, and 1941; he also won a juvenile Academy Award for Boys Town (1938). Rooney and Judy Garland co-starred in a series of highly popular movie musicals, including Babes in Arms (1939). “We weren’t just a team,” he said, “we were magic.”   Rooney’s films included National Velvet (1944), Requiem for a Heavyweight (1962), and The Black Stallion (1979). For his exuberant performance with Ann Miller in Sugar Babies (1979), he received a Tony nomination.  Rooney was married eight times, including to Ava Gardner (1942–43). He received a Lifetime Achievement Academy Award in 1982."
58289,"This cartoon of President Andrew Jackson and Vice President Martin Van Buren was just one of many lithographic caricatures exaggerating Van Buren's influence on Jackson's allegedly tyrannical and misguided administration. The issue here was Jackson's intention to abolish the Bank of the United States and the dire effects it might have on commerce and trade. Although Jackson's fiscal policies alone did not cause the Panic of 1836 and the depression that subsequently plagued Van Buren's administration (1837-41), this cartoon correctly anticipated that hard economic times lay ahead.   With the possible exceptions of Theodore Roosevelt and Richard Nixon, no sitting vice president has been caricatured more often than Van Buren."
58342,"Born Atlanta, Georgia     Although many important civil rights leaders emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Martin Luther King Jr. personified the struggle for African American equality and justice. King’s synthesis of Christian theology and its message of a supporting and loving God, along with Mohandas Gandhi’s tactics of nonviolent protest, became the defining features of the civil rights movement. In 1963 King focused the nation’s attention on the African American struggle by leading a massive civil rights protest in Birmingham, Alabama, and the August 28 March on Washington, in which he delivered his historic “I have a dream” speech. By the mid-1960s King also became involved in the antiwar movement. This photograph by Benedict Fernandez was taken on April 15, 1967, after a march from New York’s Central Park to the United Nations Plaza, where King delivered an address denouncing the Vietnam War as racist."
58366,"Dorothy Parker possessed the most caustic wit of her age. Though slight of build with a soft voice, she became the ""world’s most quoted woman"" for her devastating barbs and offbeat humor. ""To those who had never seen her,"" a reporter once commented, ""she loomed in their mind’s eye like Mae West gone wild."" She worked at Vogue and Vanity Fair before becoming one of the founding editors of the New Yorker in 1925. Parker wrote biting reviews and often sarcastic poetry, though it was her more serious short stories that proved to be the most enduring aspect of her literary output. In the 1930s she went to Hollywood to work as a screenwriter, earning at times more than $5,000 a week. As the playwright Lillian Hellman remarked at her passing: ""She was part of nothing and nobody except herself. It was this independence of mind and spirit that was her true distinction."""
58468,"Seen here in her trademark tricorn hat, Frances Perkins spoke in primly reserved accents that put one reporter in mind of someone who had just ""swallowed a press release."" Nevertheless, as Franklin Roosevelt's secretary of labor and the first woman to hold a cabinet post, she held her own in the masculine universe of New Deal policymaking. Under her leadership, the Department of Labor exercised greater influence than it ever had. Among the accomplishments of her tenure was the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which banned child labor and set the nation's first minimum wage.  Upon Perkins's appointment in 1933, a union leader declared that ""labor can never be reconciled"" to a woman managing its concerns. However, when Time ran this drawing several months later, it reported that workers were growing increasingly ""jubilant"" over having her at the Department of Labor.  "
58487,"Renowned for making songs her own, Billie Holiday once explained, ""I hate straight singing. I have to change a tune to my own way of doing it. That's all I know."" This attitude characterized not only her singing style but her life as well. Having endured a difficult childhood, Holiday moved to New York City in 1927. Although intent on fashioning a musical career, she began performing to supplement her meager income as a housemaid. Success onstage led to recording opportunities and, beginning in 1937, a close working relationship with Count Basie's band. Holiday later joined the Artie Shaw Orchestra, becoming one of the first African American singers to headline an all-white band. Despite the stardom she achieved, Holiday suffered various personal crises during the last two decades of her life, several of which were the result of drug and alcohol abuse."
58520,"Particularly early in his career, people tended to underestimate Franklin Roosevelt. Handsome, genial, and affable, he presented a mask to the world that hid (in words applied to Lincoln) “the little engine of his ambition.” Raised to a tradition of public service, he sought to emulate the career of his distant cousin, the famous Theodore. Like the earlier Roosevelt, FDR served as assistant secretary of the navy (the naval vessel in this photograph acknowledges his love of that service) and governor of New York. A key event for FDR was his surviving and overcoming an attack of polio in 1921 that cost him the use of his legs. He refused to retire from politics, and his struggle against his infirmity enhanced a steely determination to succeed, even as he presented an impassive face to the world."
58527,"As the Second Continental Congress moved toward a vote for independence, Robert Morris, one of America's leading merchants, thought that the country was not ready for it. In the interest of colonial unity, Morris absented himself from the Pennsylvania delegation when the vote was taken on July 2, but added his signature to the embossed copy of the Declaration of Independence on August 2. ""I am not one of those politicians that run testy when my own plans are not adopted,"" Morris said. ""I think it is the duty of a good citizen to follow when he cannot lead.""   During the Revolutionary War, Morris did yeoman service, championing the formation of the American navy, striving to keep Washington's army fed and supplied, and, as superintendent of finance, pledging his personal credit as a substitute ""for that which the Country Had lost."""
58590,"Born Milan, Ohio    Painted during Thomas Alva Edison's visit to Paris for the Universal Exposition of 1889, Abraham A. Anderson's portrait depicts the wealthy entrepreneur at the height of his career. World-renowned for his inventions-including the phonograph, incandescent lamp, and movie camera-Edison, who received numerous honors in Europe, presided over one of the most popular exhibitions at the exposition. Particularly intriguing to audiences was Edison's phonograph, the recent improvement of which Anderson chose to picture. Although Edison patented the device in 1877, earning himself the title of the ""Wizard of Menlo Park,"" eleven years passed before he achieved sufficient clarity of sound to make it commercially viable. Using the word ""specie"" as a test, Edison labored until it could be properly transmitted. ""When that was done,"" Edison reported, ""I knew everything else could be done, which was a fact."""
58652,"Paine, in the fifth number of his Crisis essays (1778), had defended General Washington when he was being criticized in Congress and in danger of losing his command. In 1796, bitter that President Washington had done nothing to effect his release from prison, he taunted, ""You slept away your time in the field, till the finances of the country were completely exhausted, and you have but little share in the glory of the final event.""  Washington made no response to Paine's denunciatory pamphlet, but in a private letter he noted that his administration was being ""knocked down"" and his character ""traduced as low as they are capable of sinking it."" As evidence, he enclosed ""a letter of Mr. Paine to me, printed in this city and disseminated with great industry."""
58685,"As the son of John Adams, John Quincy Adams was groomed as a diplomat. In 1809 President Madison appointed him America’s first minister to Russia. Adams was still in Russia when he was appointed to the peace delegation at Ghent. There, he clashed with the other commissioners, particularly Henry Clay, whose card parties lasting until 4:00 a.m. incensed the studious Adams. After the treaty was completed, the two men fought again over which of them would take the delegation’s official papers back to Washington.  The presidential election of 1824 pitted ""Johnny Q,"" the diplomat, against Andrew Jackson, the war hero. Jackson won the popular vote; however, Adams’s old nemesis Henry Clay gave Adams the majority of electoral votes to win the presidency. When Adams appointed Clay secretary of state, Jackson supporters declared that a ""corrupt bargain"" had been made. Four years later, Jackson defeated Adams for the presidency."
58739,"Julian Alden Weir's portrait of John Twachtman, made at the height of their careers, documents the professionally nurturing friendship between these two American impressionists. Weir's drawing-with its dynamic, asymmetrical placement of the figure-demonstrates his admiration for Japanese prints. The spontaneous look of the rapidly sketched lines reflects both impressionist practice and Weir's bond with Twachtman. The two artists lived near one another, taught at the same institutions, and socialized frequently. In 1889 they showed their impressionist-inspired work in a two-person exhibition. Two years later, in a letter to Weir, Twachtman bubbled: ""That was a splendid talk we had this evening. . . . I want to tell you how confident I feel. Tomorrow will be a fine day and I wish for lots of canvas and paint to go to work with.""  "
58831,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
58832,"Dolley Madison served as White House hostess during the administrations of the widowed Thomas Jefferson and her own husband, James Madison. Her effervescence doubtless accounted, in part at least, for the popularity of Madison's presidency in its last several years. After the end of Madison's term in 1817, Dolley helped her husband put his papers in order, selling a portion of them to Congress after his death.  William Elwell painted Dolley Madison's portrait in February 1848 and later sold it to her longtime friend William Winston Seaton, editor and co-owner of the Washington, D.C. newspaper The National Intelligencer. The portrait offers a glimpse of the aging Mrs. Madison, described by the artist in his diary as ""a very Estimable lady-kind & obliging-one of the Old School.""  "
58833,"Excluded from public professions, cultivated women sought other avenues for their talents. From discussing the issues of the day in informal salon gatherings, it was a short step for women to become writers, especially since the antebellum period saw a burgeoning number of magazines catering to women. So Harriet Beecher Stowe started a career that made her one of the most popular novelists of the nineteenth century. Stowe's place in American history was sealed with her novel Uncle Tom's Cabin (1851-52), which sold 300,000 copies in its first year. Uncle Tom's Cabin was a reform novel; Stowe was motivated to write it by the Fugitive Slave Law and the effect that slavery had in destroying the African American family. No more effective charge could be made in a nation that, both North and South, revered the family as the foundation of society.   "
58836,"Appointed colonial governor of Massachusetts in 1741, William Shirley spent much of the next fifteen years in military and diplomatic engagements with the French. After war broke out between England and France in 1744, Shirley won an important victory by orchestrating a successful attack on the French stronghold at Louisbourg, Nova Scotia. This portrait by distinguished English painter Thomas Hudson-with a background that recalls this famous naval conquest-was painted in London while Shirley was participating in boundary negotiations with the French following the war's end in 1748. In 1755, at the outset of the French and Indian War, King George II promoted Shirley to commander of British forces in North America. He lost this position and his governorship a year later, however, after failing to halt French advances."
58864,"Yes. This is he.    The noted midcentury sculptor Leonard Volk took this life mask of Lincoln before he started his run for the presidency. Volk wanted to make a bust of Lincoln to add to his collection of American statesmen, but he realized that Lincoln did not have time to sit. Hence he created this life mask, which shows the future president without a beard, and a face whose smoothness contrasts decidedly with the Clark Mills's lined and furrowed mask of 1865. Poet Richard Watson Gilder wrote after Lincoln's assassination, ""The mask doeth keep the very form and mold/Of our great martyr's face. Yes. This is he."""
58915,"It was said that football coach Vince Lombardi ruled his teams largely ""through fear,"" and according to one of his players, he treated all—veteran stars as well as unproven rookies—the same, ""like dogs."" But even the victims of his harsh ways could not help but love him for his results. Between 1959, when he became head coach of the Green Bay Packers, and his retirement from that post in 1967, Lombardi shaped his team into the most formidable force in professional football. In the process, he laid claim to five NFL championships and two Super Bowl titles.  This cover portrait appeared on the eve of the 1962 championship game, in which the defending NFL champion Packers successfully defended their title against the New York Giants. "
58933,"Dropping out of Tuskegee Institute when he ran out of money, Ralph Ellison moved to New York City, where he wrote politically driven fiction and essays heavily influenced by both Marxism and the literary naturalism of the 1930s. But he broke through as an original fiction writer with his masterful novel, Invisible Man (1952). It begins: ""I am an invisible man. . . . I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me."" And no one ever does: the anonymous African American narrator, despite a life of heroic resistance, never makes white society ""see"" him. In making this bitterly powerful point, Invisible Man exists as a fully realized work of art, drawing on sources from the Odyssey to the Harlem jazz and club scene. Transcending its subject matter, Invisible Man is a humanistic expression of the will to self-determination.  "
58945,"Born Grafton, West Virginia    After pursuing the study of painting and drawing in Europe and the United States, Frances Benjamin Johnston set her sights on a career as a journalist-illustrator. But then she discovered the potential of the camera, and by the late 1880s she was intent on becoming America’s first female photojournalist. Early picture stories that first earned her distinction documented the Pennsylvania coal industry and New England shoe manufacturing. At the Paris Exposition of 1900, Johnston’s photographs of public education in Washington, D.C., and of life at the Hampton Institute, a Virginia school for African American students, earned her a gold medal. In her later years, she became well known for her architectural photography. Evidence suggests that this likeness was taken in Venice in the summer of 1905 and that it was the work of Johnston’s traveling companion, Gertrude Käsebier, who had built a substantial reputation as a portrait photographer. "
58971,"One of the most widely read newspaper columnists of his generation, Heywood Broun was famous for his delectable humor as well as for prose that could ""hit like a sledge-hammer."" He honed his skills by working as a reporter, sportswriter, drama critic, and World War I correspondent. In 1919 Broun took up literary criticism and became a founding member of the famous Algonquin Round Table group of witty literati. Joining the New York World (1921), he launched the freewheeling, syndicated column of opinion and observation that earned him an enthusiastic following. When Broun's spirited attack on the verdict in the notorious Sacco and Vanzetti case cost him his job, he moved his column to the New York Telegram. Failing in his run for Congress as a Socialist in 1930, Broun succeeded three years later in forming the American Newspaper Guild, the first national union for newspaper workers."
59003,"Born near Eatonton, Georgia     Joel Chandler Harris, a journalist, humorist, and author of the Uncle Remus stories, lived across the street in Atlanta, Georgia, from Lucy May Stanton when she was a child. She often sat on his knee, listening to his animal stories. When she first asked to paint him in 1906, he queried her desire to paint “an old buzzard like me.” This is a second, larger portrait created after Harris’s death, and it shows off Stanton’s loose and flowing technique, with puddles and washes of pure color. It won the Medal of Honor at the Pennsylvania Society of Miniature Painters Exhibition in 1917."
59064,"  Territorial expansion generated a spirit of technological adventure and a search for new methods to handle the unique conditions of American life. Cyrus McCormick, a farmer in Virginia's Shenandoah Valley, succeeded where his father had failed by constructing the first practical reaping machine. This reaper was a first step in the mechanization of American agriculture, allowing the efficient cultivation of large tracts of farmland by small numbers of farmers. This industrialization of the land allowed the United States to boost agricultural production to unprecedented levels and to feed growing cities and industrial towns.  McCormick's design was pirated by competitors, but he overcame his rivals by founding his own factory outside Chicago in 1847. There, he contributed to the pace of industrial growth by using standardized parts and assembly-line production-methods that had been pioneered by Samuel Colt and others.  "
59260,"Born Versailles, Kentucky     During the campaign of 1860, many southerners declared that Abraham Lincoln's election to the presidency would give them no choice but to secede from the Union. One notable exception was Kentucky senator John Crittenden. This passionate advocate of national unity undertook the task of reaching an accommodation designed to derail the secession movement of 1861. Central to his plan was a proposal that would have permanently guaranteed the rights of slaveholders below the nation's 36°30' parallel. By now, however, bitterness over the slavery question ran too deeply, and neither North nor South could accept this conciliating measure. Instead, Crittenden had to content himself with ensuring that his own Kentucky did not secede; it was largely through his exertions that this state remained loyal to the Union after most of the South had left."
59345,"Born Portland, Indiana  Twyla Tharp’s offbeat early work earned her a small group of enthusiasts, but in the mid-1970s she began to search for a wider audience. She created Push Comes to Shove for Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1976, and his performance helped establish Tharp as one of the most innovative choreographers of the era. Noted for her offbeat but technically precise combination of movements and her flippant humor, she choreographed such popular movies as Hair, Ragtime, and Amadeus. Tharp also created such important stage works as “Nine Sinatra Songs” and Movin’ Out, which ran for 1,303 performances.  Whatever dance medium she has worked in, Tharp has always been rooted in a “sort of American belief and the fact that the old American dream can still come true. In other words, you do something you believe in and you think is worthwhile and is truly good, and it will be honored. And it has worked out that way. Can you believe it?”"
59354,"Henry William Mathew Meade was only twenty when the Meade Brothers began operations ""in an humble way . . . in a small room"" in Albany in 1842. Despite this modest beginning, the brothers soon moved to larger quarters and set their sights on building their firm’s reputation. They received wide recognition in 1846 for sending daguerreotypes of Niagara Falls to Nicholas I of Russia and Louis-Philippe of France. A year later, Henry Meade embarked on an extended tour of Europe, with the goal of familiarizing himself with new photographic techniques and equipment being used abroad."
59378,"In 1606 King James I granted a charter to a group of London entrepreneurs, the Virginia Company, to found a colonial settlement in the Chesapeake region of North America. Hopeful of the riches that such a venture might bring, James instructed these explorers to search for gold and a water route to Asia. The first English settlers reached the New World in May 1607 and promptly named their community Jamestown after their royal benefactor.  James had ascended to the throne in 1603, succeeding both his mother, Mary, Queen of Scots, and his cousin, Elizabeth I. Although intellectually brilliant and a patron of Shakespeare and the arts, extravagant spending and favoritism marred his reputation and earned him the label ""the wisest fool in Christendom."" The finest achievement of his reign was the translation of the Bible known as the King James Version.   "
59390,"   Born Los Angeles, California  Isamu Noguchi earned international acclaim as a versatile sculptor who created evocative works in media ranging from stone and steel to clay and paper. The son of a Japanese father and an American mother, Noguchi addressed his dual ethnicity through art that was informed by both Eastern and Western aesthetic traditions. He embraced abstraction in response to the pure forms of modernist sculptor Constantin Brancusi, but until the early 1940s, Noguchi was best known for his figurative portrait sculpture. In 1935 he created the first of many striking stage sets for dancer-choreographer Martha Graham and later produced a mammoth stainless steel relief for the Associated Press Building in Rockefeller Center (1938). During World War II, Noguchi spent six months in a Japanese American relocation camp. In the postwar period, his work grew to include landscape design, while his sculpture ranged from the monumental to delicate, lantern-like forms. "
59455,"As Arthur Miller reveled in the accolades for All My Sons, fellow playwright Tennessee Williams was also experiencing the heady joys of Broadway triumph following the recent premiere of his play A Streetcar Named Desire. Regarded as a classic of American theater practically from the moment it opened, Streetcar earned Williams a Pulitzer Prize. In the picture essay on the play that occasioned this photograph, Life magazine hailed him as the ""dreamy young man"" who was now ""the most important new playwright in U.S. theater."" Not all of Williams's later plays lived up to the implied promise of that billing. But many did-among them Night of the Iguana, Sweet Bird of Youth, and Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, which won him his second Pulitzer Prize.  "
59456,"Inspired by the death of singer Janis Joplin, who had grown up in the same small Texas town as artist Robert Rauschenberg, Signs captures the turbulence of the 1960s. Placing Joplin in the upper center, Rauschenberg juxtaposes soldiers in Vietnam with peace protestors. Robert F. Kennedy, killed while campaigning, speaks out at center, while his brother, President John F. Kennedy, in profile, overlooks footage of his assassination. Opposite the president, the presence of Apollo 11 astronaut Buzz Aldrin Jr. testifies to the realization of the Kennedy's dream of a moon landing. Fallen civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., paired with a wounded supporter, recalls ongoing challenges to the American ideal of ""equality for all."" Rauschenberg hoped that Signs would ""remind us of love, terror, violence of the last ten years. . . . The danger lies in forgetting.""  "
59502,"Born Centralia, Washington  One of the great avant-garde figures of modern dance, Merce Cunningham was a protégé of Martha Graham and performed with her company from 1939 to 1945. He then began his lifelong partnership with composer John Cage, merging his abstract choreography with Cage’s austere modernism to produce works of unstructured randomness. Cunningham often only told his dancers about the sequence of the dances they were to perform just before they went onstage: dance, he believed, was as complex and as random as life itself.  In 1953 he formed his own company, where he showcased abstract dance focused on pure movement. Although he created nearly 200 works, Cunningham always recognized the ephemeral nature of dance: “You have to love dance to stick to it. It gives you nothing back . . . but that single fleeting moment when you feel alive.”  AndyWarhol created this portrait as a proof for a print in the portfolio Cunningham I, a fund-raising effort for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company."
59507,"When Miguel Covarrubias met Eva Le Gallienne in 1923, the young actress was receiving accolades for her role in Ferenc Molnár's drama The Swan. The critics had noticed her swanlike neck, heart-shaped face, and high forehead, all evident in Covarrubias's portrayal. ""The jutting brow,"" commented Theater magazine, ""is curiously high, remarkably broad, extraordinarily full. It is crammed with brains, which she uses."" Covarrubias, only eighteen when he created this likeness, had just arrived in New York from Mexico. When introduced to literary circles by popular novelist and critic Carl Van Vechten, the young man ""was acclaimed at once, held, indeed, almost a reception."" His popularity increased when his distinctive stylized portraits started appearing in Vanity Fair magazine. ""They are bald and crude and devoid of nonsense,"" one artist wrote about Covarrubias's drawings, ""like a mountain or a baby."""
59688,"Born Raleigh, North Carolina    Andrew Johnson of Tennessee was the only senator from the South to remain loyal to the Union, and in 1864, in an effort to win the votes of southern unionists in the presidential election, he was picked to be Abraham Lincoln's new running mate. Yet Lincoln's tragic death in April 1865 thrust Johnson into a critical position of power; after a tumultuous four years of war in which Lincoln had expanded the powers of the presidency, Johnson became the victim of a Congress inclined to curtail his executive authority. His violation of the Tenure of Office Act (later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court) in the removal of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, led to his impeachment in 1868. Johnson's acquittal by a single vote was not just a personal victory but a national vindication of the office of the presidency."
59711,"By his own admission, crooning idol Rudy Vallee ""never had much of a voice,"" but that did not stop him from becoming one of the nation's most popular performers. A self-taught saxophonist, Vallee formed a dance band in 1925 while working his way through Yale. He kept the ensemble intact after graduation, and soon Vallee and his Connecticut Yankees were playing to wildly enthusiastic crowds at New York's Heigh-Ho Club. After a highly successful radio debut in 1928, Vallee and his band catapulted to stardom as the featured performers on NBC radio's ""Fleischmann Hour"" (1929-36)-the program credited with introducing the variety show format to the airwaves. By the time his career ebbed in the 1940s, Vallee, his trademark megaphone, and twangy rendition of his signature song, ""My Time Is Your Time,"" had become emblems of an entire era in American popular music."
59770,"Commander of American land forces in the Pacific at the outbreak of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur suffered the worst defeat of his career in the spring of 1942, when he was forced to flee the Philippines in the wake of Japanese invasion. Uttering on his arrival in Australia his famous words, ""I shall return,"" MacArthur now faced the task of repelling Japan's drive for dominion in the southwest Pacific. His success in that effort, combined with his own genius for self-promotion in the press, made him one of the most popular heroes of the war back in civilian America. By the time he made good his promise to retake the Philippines in spring 1945, his reputation had reached legendary proportions, and the following September, he was chosen to preside over Japan's final surrender."
59818,"Born New York City  As the Manhattan Project began developing an atomic weapon in the months following America’s entry into World War II, Robert Oppenheimer’s prominence among physicists inevitably drew him into the effort. By late 1942, he was presiding over the project’s laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Over the next three years, his skill in encouraging cooperative openness on a staff heavily peopled with arrogant geniuses—along with his own remarkable ability to absorb new data—became crucial to the project’s advancement. But when success finally came with the explosion of the world’s first atomic bomb in the New Mexico desert on July 16, 1945, Oppenheimer’s sense of triumph was mixed with sadness. All he could think of, he later recalled, was a passage from the Hindu sacred work “Bhagavad Gita”: “I am become Death, the destroyer of Worlds.”"
59844,"In 1940, with German bombers dropping their deadly cargoes daily on British cities, England stood in desperate need of blood supplies for its thousands of wounded civilians. To fill this shortage, the British turned to the African American physician Charles Drew, America's recognized pioneer in the preservation and storage of blood. Drew expeditiously organized the Blood Transfusion Association, and the crisis in war-torn England's hospitals was met. A year later, Drew became the medical director of the American Red Cross's blood-donor project, and it was largely because of his expertise that this enterprise saved many American lives during the war. Yet when the Red Cross ordered that all non-Caucasian blood be stored separately, Drew resigned, stating that there were no scientific or medical reasons for classifying blood by race. Today Drew is universally deemed the ""Father of the Blood Bank."""

59915,"In 1887, when Henry L. Dawes introduced and secured passage of the General Allotment Act (also known as the Dawes Act), the Massachusetts senator believed that he had taken an important step in helping Native Americans toward a better future. Aimed at promoting their assimilation into American society, the bill dissolved the legal standing of tribal nations and divided communally held lands into individual holdings. Dawes had been raised in a farming family and, as chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, he believed that Native Americans would be more secure as property-owning farmers. Ultimately, the General Allotment Act proved an extraordinary failure. Not only did it disregard the great heterogeneity of tribal communities, but it also resulted in the permanent loss of millions of acres of traditional Native lands. The bill was ultimately overturned in 1934 with the passage of the Indian Reorganization Act.  "
59927,"Robert E. Lee was born into a family prominent in Virginia society and early American politics. A young man with an intense desire to prove himself, he attained the highest rank available to cadets and graduated from West Point in 1829.  Initially, Lee opposed both secession and war. But when Virginia voted to secede from the Union, he resigned from the U.S. Army and went to his native state's defense. Placed in command of the Army of Northern Virginia in June 1862, Lee gave the Confederacy moments of hope with several early victories. His army was always severely outnumbered, so it was a triumph that he managed to keep it on the field for the duration of the war. By 1864, however, time and resources were working against him, and in May, Ulysses S. Grant became his last and fateful adversary.  "
59928,"An overweight twenty-five-year-old Boston bookseller who had taught himself military engineering and artillery out of books, Henry Knox was chief of artillery for the Continental army. In 1775, with Boston under British control, Knox commanded the 300-mile trek to Fort Ticonderoga to bring back by ox sleds the fifty-nine cannons that, mounted on Dorchester Heights, forced the British to evacuate the city. Throughout the seven years of battle, Knox would be by General Washington's side, his close friend and indispensable colleague and later the man the president would pick to be his secretary of war.       Knox is painted here in the uniform of a major general.  He wears the badge of the Society of the Cincinnati, the fraternity of Continental army officers he envisioned in 1783."
59974,"Born Warren County, New York    Scarcely more than twenty when he opened his first photography studio in New York City in 1844, Mathew Brady quickly earned acclaim for his superior portraits. His clientele grew to include prominent men and women from every quarter, and his collection of images of the famous was soon unsurpassed. Although daily studio operations remained the province of his camera operators and technicians, Brady provided the creative vision and marketing expertise that made him the best-known photographer in America by 1860. At the outset of the Civil War, he greatly expanded the scope of his business by launching an ambitious effort to document the conflict. By assembling and outfitting teams of photographers and securing permission for them to accompany Union forces into the field, Brady ensured that his cameras would be positioned to produce an extraordinary visual record of the war. "
59975,"A charismatic preacher with superb organizational skills and a strong commitment to social welfare, Reverend Adam Clayton Powell Sr. not only built flourishing congregations but also ministered to the needs of the greater community. In 1908, following a fruitful fifteen-year pastorship at Immanuel Baptist Church in New Haven, Connecticut, Powell assumed charge of New York City's Abyssinian Baptist Church. Under his dynamic leadership, that church's membership swelled from 1,600 to 14,000, making it the largest Protestant congregation in the United States. In 1923 Powell facilitated the church's relocation from midtown to 138th Street in Harlem, where it immediately became a vital community center, providing a host of services to those in need. Committed to improving race relations, Powell further expanded his ministry by helping to found the National Urban League and serving as an early leader in the NAACP."
60080,"In 1920 the Republican Party was without a clear choice for president, eventually settling on Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio. Calvin Coolidge, who had received favorable national publicity for his response to the Boston police strike, was nominated for the vice presidency by acclamation at the convention. Although Coolidge was not his personal choice, Harding seemed determined to give him more than the usual role in the administration, declaring that ""the vice president should be more than a mere substitute in waiting."" Although Coolidge was the first vice president to regularly attend cabinet meetings, he remained outside of Harding's inner circle, as seen in this photograph of Harding's cabinet showing the vice president seated at the end of the table. This isolation proved fortunate for Coolidge when he assumed the presidency after Harding's death, as several corruption scandals related to the former president were unearthed.  "
60178,"Born Allegheny, Pennsylvania  American expatriate writer Gertrude Stein was a high priestess of early twentieth-century modernism for the many who visited her fabled Paris apartment. She collected and promoted avant-garde art, including that of Picasso and Matisse. Her own abstract, repetitive prose inspired the experiments of playwrights, composers, poets, and painters. ""There was an eternal quality about her,"" sculptor Jo Davidson wrote. ""She somehow symbolized wisdom."" He chose to depict her here as ""a sort of modern Buddha."" Delighted by the sculpture, Stein composed one of her famous prose portraits of Davidson, later published in Vanity Fair alongside a photograph of this work."

60324,"Asa Philip Randolph believed that the key to African American equality was economics, which led him to develop a number of organized alliances and publications intended to improve the circumstances of blacks in the workforce. His efforts to unite exploited and underpaid black workers eventually resulted in the formation of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters in the mid-1920s, and in his acceptance as a spokesman for civil rights. Later in life, his vacillation between promoting both integration and racial exclusivity engendered disdain from Black Power advocates. Even so, his impact on the American labor movement and the cause of civil rights served to inspire the next generation of leaders, who subscribed to his motto, ""Rather we die standing on our feet fighting for rights than to exist upon our knees begging for life."""

60518,"Born Commerce, Texas  An outstanding air combat tactician, Claire L. Chennault was one of America’s most innovative military aviators prior to and during World War II. While serving in the Army Air Corps in the 1930s, Chennault developed team combat tactics, experimented with air drops of troops and supplies, and pushed for fighter aircraft with greater range and firepower. In 1937 he retired from the military and went to China, where he supervised the training of the Chinese air force under nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek. Returning to the United States in 1940, Chennault successfully recruited more than 100 pilots and purchased new Curtiss-Wright P-40B fighters for the American Volunteer Group. Nicknamed the ""Flying Tigers,"" this combat wing became legendary for significantly curtailing Japanese air attacks over mainland China and the Burma Road. When the AVG was incorporated into the United States Army in July 1942, Chennault was made a general."
60584,"In the fall of 1965, Time ran a cover story about America’s neighboring communist leader, Fidel Castro of Cuba. Nearly seven years before, he had led a revolution—fueled by dubious hopes and promises and supported by six-and-a-half million Cubans who cheered his claim to power. Castro, however, proved to be a socialist at heart and an attentive disciple of Russian communism. His authoritative vision for the future of Cuba dashed the dreams of its people, who soon found themselves under the thumb of a despot and living in a puppet state of the Soviets. “The typical industrial worker,” stated one observer in Havana, “has gained nothing and lost much by the revolution. If he was earning $225 a month before, he was able to look forward to buying a refrigerator, television set or even a car. Now all these things are shut off to him.”  Fidel Castro  nacido en 1926     En el otoño de 1965, Time publicó un artículo de portada acerca del vecino líder comunista cubano Fidel Castro. Unos siete años antes, Castro había encabezado una revolución impulsada por ambiguas promesas y apoyada por seis millones y medio de cubanos que aplaudieron su ascenso al poder. Sin embargo, Castro resultó un socialista duro y atento discípulo del comunismo ruso. Su visión autoritaria para el futuro de Cuba frustró los sueños de su pueblo, que pronto se encontró bajo el puño de un déspota en un país títere de los soviéticos. “El trabajador industrial típico”, observaba alguien en La Habana, “no ha ganado nada y ha perdido mucho con la revolución. Si antes ganaba $225 al mes, podía planear la compra de un refrigerador, un televisor o hasta un automóvil. Ahora todo esto le está vedado”.

60701,"The 1960s, a decade of great cultural change, presented prime opportunities for Time’s editors to turn to Pop artists for covers by the likes of Andy Warhol and Robert Rauschenberg. Traditional art was still the norm, however. For instance, in December 1966 an oil painting was deemed perfect for portraying Julie Andrews, Oscar-winner and star of two recent box-office hits, Mary Poppins (1964) and The Sound of Music (1965). In covering “the most celebrated movie actress in the U.S.,” Time went to Hollywood and found the thirty-one-year-old Andrews full of old-school wholesomeness, an aberration “in a town where everybody plays the angles.” There was nothing pretentious about her. She would, however, practice her singing at the top of her lungs—her soprano voice had perfect pitch—as she scooted about town in her 1965 Ford Falcon station wagon.   Julie Andrews  nacida en 1935     Los sesenta fueron una década de grandes cambios culturales que dieron a los editores de Time la gran oportunidad de contratar para sus portadas a artistas pop como Andy Warhol y Robert Rauschenberg. No obstante, el arte tradicional aún sentaba la norma. Por ejemplo, en diciembre de 1966 se consideró que una pintura al óleo era lo perfecto para representar a Julie Andrews, ganadora del Oscar y estrella de dos recientes éxitos de taquilla: Mary Poppins (1964) y The Sound of Music (1965). Para su reportaje sobre “la actriz más famosa del cine americano”, Time viajó a Hollywood y se encontró a una mujer de treinta y un años con una entereza que parecía de otra época, una aberración “en una ciudad donde todo el mundo anda con segundas intenciones”. No tenía nada de pretenciosa. Lo que sí hacía era cantar a todo pulmón, con una voz de soprano perfectamente afinada, mientras conducía por la ciudad en su “station wagon” Ford Falcon del 65.

60702,"Jack Kerouac was the avatar of the Beat generation writers, and his novel On the Road (1957) has inspired countless road trips. He developed a theory of literary style called ""spontaneous prose"" based on the stream-of-consciousness of the jazz solo and called himself a ""jazz poet."" He was equally influenced by Buddhism, advising artists to allow their ideas and images to flow freely under the motto, ""first thought, best thought."" In a 1950 letter to his muse, Neal Cassady, Kerouac wrote of his obsession with the new word cool: he contrasted the ""cool mind"" of jazz musicians (relaxed and detached) to the ""raw mind"" of the Beat writers (exuberant, primitive). In effect, Kerouac re-booted an American romanticism first launched by Emerson and Whitman, emphasizing personal experience over education and expertise. His works directly influenced the counterculture of the 1960s, a decade in which he descended into alcoholism and an early death. In this photograph, Kerouac tries to tune in to a hip signal just beyond his reach."
60709,"Sequoyah, allegedly the son of a chief’s daughter and a fur trader from Virginia, devised a method of writing the Cherokee language. His syllabary of eighty-six symbols representing vowel and consonant sounds was approved in 1821 by the Cherokee nation, which later presented him with a specially inscribed peace medal. His simple utilitarian system made possible a rapid spread of literacy throughout the Cherokee nation. Tribal healers set down ceremonies for medicine, divination, war, and traditional ball games; missionaries translated hymns and the New Testament into the Native language; and publishers launched the Cherokee Phoenix, a weekly bilingual newspaper. Sequoyah was painted in Washington, D.C., in 1828 wearing his peace medal.    Sequoyah, quien se alega era hijo de un tratante de pieles de Virginia con la hija de un jefe indio, inventó un método para escribir el idioma cherokee. Su silabario de ochenta y seis símbolos que representan sonidos vocales y consonantes fue aprobado en 1821 por la Nación Cherokee, que luego le otorgó una medalla de la paz inscrita especialmente para él. Su sencillo y práctico sistema hizo posible la rápida alfabetización del pueblo cherokee. Los curanderos de la tribu pudieron así anotar los ceremoniales relativos a la medicina, la adivinación, la guerra y los juegos de pelota tradicionales; los misioneros, por su parte, tradujeron al lenguaje nativos los himnos e incluso el Nuevo Testamento; y unos editores lanzaron el Cherokee Phoenix, un periódico semanal bilingüe.

60772,"This allegorical lithograph, published in 1867, two years after the end of the Civil War, symbolically depicts the idealism in the conclusion of President Lincoln’s second inaugural address: With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation’s wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations."
60773,"   Born Boston, Massachusetts  This engraving was Franklin’s favorite likeness of himself during the 1760s. It was based on a painting made while he was in London in 1762 that emphasized his electrical experiments and inventions. He sent impressions to friends and colleagues, and his son William Franklin ordered at least one hundred, many of which were sold in Philadelphia. Franklin clearly understood the role of portraiture in securing one’s public reputation, and distributed this likeness widely. "
60779,"The November 1963 assassination of the youthful and idealistic John F. Kennedy, who espoused civil rights, set the nation's eyes on the moon, and provided a tough stance against communism, shocked the nation and set the tone for a tumultuous decade. Published five years later, Andy Warhol's Flash portfolio combines press bulletins and photographs to chronicle the event as it unfolded. The black-on-black portrait that leads off this portfolio of fourteen prints powerfully evokes the nation's mourning for its fallen leader. The magenta portrait juxtaposes a cheerful, confident president with pictures of the presidential seal and of Jackie Kennedy smiling from the presidential motorcade in Dallas. Once commenting, ""I feel I'm very much a part of my times, of my culture,"" Warhol provides a compelling account of the tragedy of Kennedy's premature death, which still resonates today.  "
60791,"Winfield Scott served as the commanding general of the U.S. Army during the Mexican War. Known as ""Old Fuss and Feathers"" for his insistence on military discipline, he directed the 1847 campaign that captured the coastal city of Veracruz. From there he led U.S. forces west to Mexico City, where he again defeated the Mexican army and occupied the city. Although President James K. Polk urged him to continue the military campaign, the American diplomat Nicholas Trist proceeded to negotiate and sign the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war and ultimately ceded to the United States 525,000 square miles of territory in the present-day Southwest. Scott set his sights on the White House on several occasions but was never elected. When he retired from the military in 1861-roughly the year this photograph was taken-he had accumulated more than fifty years of military service.  "
60877,"Born Campbell's Station, Tennessee     President Abraham Lincoln considered the appointment of David Glasgow Farragut as commander of the West Gulf Blockading Squadron the best one he made during the Civil War. Sailing in the flagship USS Hartford on April 24, 1862, Farragut led his fleet of seventeen vessels in a successful run by the Confederate defenses, engaged and defeated the enemy flotilla, and captured New Orleans.  Rear Admiral Farragut spent the next two years blockading the Gulf Coast and maintaining Union control over the lower Mississippi before preparing for the capture of the Mobile Bay defenses in August 1864. By month's end, Farragut's fleet had forced the Confederate surrender. This, the major victory of Farragut's naval career, earned him the rank of vice admiral. Two years later, in declining health, he was commissioned admiral.  This portrait was painted early in Farragut's naval career, when he was a lieutenant."
61013,"Soldierly discipline and an almost fanatical devotion to the Presbyterian faith were two legendary aspects of the Civil War career of Confederate general Thomas J. ""Stonewall"" Jackson. The bowed heads and pious demeanor of the soldiers in this etching titled Scene in Stonewall Jackson’s Camp suggest the religious services and prayer meetings that were held daily within Jackson’s Second Corps, especially during the early months of 1863. No commander in the field did more to invoke the need for divine providence in military operations than Jackson. Jackson never had enough chaplains in his ranks to minister to the troops, in spite of his efforts to recruit them."
61105,"Lyman Beecher, a Presbyterian clergyman, was the patriarch of one of the most talented and influential families in American history. In the 1820s, he tapped America's fervor for a religion that would serve individuals and society alike. A powerful preacher who grounded his faith in a belief in the individual will, Lyman conducted a continuous, passionate revival, demanding that his congregants redouble their efforts at personal reform and good works. His son Henry did not share his father's fierceness but became a national figure for his preaching style. In addition to the novelist Harriet Beecher Stowe, the Beecher family also included Catherine (1800-1878), an important domestic reformer, and the ministers Charles (1815-1900), Edward (1803-1895), and Thomas (1824-1900).  "
61121,"As Time’s publisher noted, Boris Chaliapin departed ""somewhat from his usual style,"" adding ""a touch of the abstract, a suggestion of pop"" to this cover for June 5, 1964. The accompanying story was about the opening of the New York World’s Fair. The writer was a young Time reporter named John McPhee, who was on the cusp of the eclectic and prolific writing career that would garner him many fans, much notoriety, and distinguished honors, including a Pulitzer Prize. In the balmy spring of 1964, no reporting assignment could have been more agreeable than spending ten days exploring the innumerable exhibitions, attractions, and international foods at the World’s Fair. Judging from McPhee’s smorgasbord-like essay, he apparently sampled all it had to offer with great enthusiasm.  The center of the cover features Robert Moses, president of the World’s Fair and the influential ""master builder"" of New York City in the mid-twentieth century."
61132,"In 1944 it was assumed that Franklin Roosevelt would run for a fourth term. Democratic Party leaders, aware of Roosevelt’s poor health and fearing he would not survive another term, sought to replace Vice President Henry Wallace, whom they considered to be too left-wing. As a Senate leader, Harry Truman had positioned himself for the job even though he was unsure if he wanted it. As usual, FDR kept everyone guessing until the last minute, when he named Truman as his vice-presidential choice. At a meeting on the White House lawn, Truman was shocked by the president’s appearance, not realizing his ""feeble condition. In pouring cream in his tea, he got more cream in the saucer than he did in the cup."" He gave no hint of a problem to reporters afterward, calling the president ""fine. . . . Don’t let anybody kid you about it."""
61185,"On the night of April 14, 1865, Abraham Lincoln was attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. That evening, the guard assigned to the president abandoned his post, and as a result, John Wilkes Booth found it easy to enter Lincoln's private box and shoot him. As Booth leapt out of the box to the stage about twelve feet below, he caught the spur of his boot on a draped American flag and broke his leg when he landed. Nevertheless, he escaped. Union soldiers cornered him twelve days later in a barn in Caroline County, Virginia, where he died of a bullet wound."
61352,"Born Kinneff, Scotland  James Honyman, an Anglican minister in Rhode Island during the first half of the eighteenth century, began his career in England as a missionary preacher with the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. In 1704, he was recruited to take charge of the newly established Trinity Church in Newport. Given Rhode Island’s religious tolerance at the time—a legacy of Roger Williams’s work—the colony was home to many antiestablishment religious sects. Although many early settlers moved there to get away from the Church of England, Honyman’s leadership proved that diverse religions could coexist in relative harmony. Over a forty-six-year career in Newport, Honyman made Trinity one of the most influential Anglican churches in colonial America. English engraver Samuel Okey created this posthumous mezzotint portrait when he lived in Rhode Island. "
61383,"Born Highland Park, Michigan    With their hit renditions of ""Shake, Rattle and Roll"" and ""Rock Around the Clock,"" Bill Haley and the Comets helped revolutionize the pop music industry in the mid-1950s by bringing rock and roll into the musical mainstream. Singer and guitarist Haley began his career performing cowboy songs and country melodies, but by the beginning of the 1950s, he and his band were exploring a new blend of popular music that fused country and western elements with those of traditional rhythm and blues. The hybrid was rock and roll, and although it did not originate with Haley, he became one of its most successful proponents. After gaining popularity with several songs, including their cover of Joe Turner's ""Shake, Rattle and Roll,"" Bill Haley and the Comets struck top-ten gold in 1955 when ""Rock Around the Clock"" became rock and roll's first international hit, thanks to its exposure in the film The Asphalt Jungle."
61418,"Sculptor Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney commissioned this portrait and a statuette of herself in New York in 1916. Davidson wrote: ""This was her way of helping me carry on. . . . Her enthusiasm did much to help sustain my courage in this period."" She funded Davidson's return to Paris after World War I to make portraits of the Allied leaders and continued to support his career, commenting about his posthumous portrait of her husband Harry Payne Whitney, ""Everything he touches is like magic."" An important early collector of modernist American art, she founded the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1931."
61432,"In 1917, Harold Hart Crane fled his parents’ disintegrating household in Ohio for New York City, where he attempted to find work and create an artistic life for himself. In New York he met a twenty-seven-year-old artist/intellectual named Carl Schmitt, who took Crane under his wing. Schmitt was Crane’s tutor in modernism, and he played an essential role in Crane’s transition from an unformed aspiring midwestern writer to the most ecstatic American poet of the city since Walt Whitman. Crane’s great book-length poem The Bridge (1930)—named after the Brooklyn Bridge—took seven years to write and is packed with the sense that the poet was nearly overwhelmed by the romance of modern life. Crane reveled in the manic energy of the city in all its aspects: from the din of construction to the promise of late-night sexual encounters. Crane swallowed the city whole, giving back in his incantory verse a sense of the possibilities and varieties of human experience. It couldn’t last. Still young, Crane came down with a terrible case of writer’s block and, in despair, committed suicide at age thirty-three. In this group of images, Carl Schmitt’s later portrait of his young protégé is fogged, indistinct, and mysterious—suggesting the ultimate mysteriousness of Crane’s personality that led him to his tragically early death."
61447,"The title of this portrait of three former mayors of Washington, D.C., has an odd ring to it. “The Olden Time” is archaic and gives a sense of remote distance, even though all three men were relatively recent office-holders and were still alive. What Alexander Gardner meant is that they were mayors before the war came and changed everything: the war was a bright dividing line that separated even recent history from the present. From left to right are Roger Chew Weightman (1787–1876), mayor from 1824 to 1827; William Winston Seaton (1785–1866), mayor from 1840 to 1850; and Peter Force (1790–1868), mayor from 1836 to 1840. All three men were also journalists and publishers at various points in their careers."
61487,"Ronald Reagan’s critics often depicted him as a “cowboy” president, wild and likely to lead the nation into war. However, he sent American troops into combat only twice—during the Grenada invasion in 1983 and the Gulf of Sidra retaliation against Libya in 1986.                   One of Reagan’s priorities was to restore American strength and influence in the world, which he believed had greatly declined in the 1960s and 1970s. When on March 24, 1986, Moammar Gadhafi’s Libyan forces fired on ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in the Gulf of Sidra—seen as an act of aggression in international waters—Reagan ordered U.S. forces to retaliate with a limited response. Four days later, the president learned from intelligence sources that Libya had orchestrated a terrorist act in West Berlin resulting in U.S. casualties. He ordered far more severe action: on April 14, U.S. bombers hit military targets in Tripoli and Benghazi, Libya.   "
61553,"The idea of connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans by building a canal through the tropical narrows of Central America was an old one, but Theodore Roosevelt seized upon the notion as a means of improving the nation's trade and defense capacities. ""To my mind,"" he wrote in 1903, ""this building of the canal through Panama will rank in kind, though not of course in degree, with the Louisiana Purchase and the acquisition of Texas."" This photograph was taken during a tour to inspect construction of the canal.  "
61562,"Born Orange County, Virginia     A career army officer, by the 1840s Zachary Taylor-""Old Rough and Ready""-was the commanding general of the southwestern territories. With the outbreak of the Mexican American War in 1846, Taylor led a small army that achieved victories against overwhelming odds at Palo Alto and Monterrey. With victory came public acclaim, which crested when Taylor won the Battle of Buena Vista in February 1847, ending the war. The Whig Party capitalized by nominating Taylor for the presidency, and he was elected in 1848. Ironically, Taylor, who had become a wealthy Louisiana planter, had opposed the annexation of Texas, knowing that expansion would reopen the slavery question. Taylor died during debate over the Compromise of 1850, the attempt to integrate the Mexican territories into the Union without disturbing the status quo on the slavery issue. "
61597,"John Quincy Adams Ward was the first distinctly American sculptor. His work resonates with the spirit of the age, rejecting Victorian sentimentality in favor of a hard-edged realism in representing forthrightly masculine figures. Even his allegorical subjects were remarkably realistic. For instance, Ward created Indian Hunter (1868), his first commission for Central Park, only after making an extensive study of Indians of the Northwest. His style appealed to the thrusting self-image of America's business and political leaders, as well as a public confident that America was emerging as an industrial and political power in the world."
61721,"A disconcerting face gazes from this drawing: at once close and distant, classic and modern. Theodore Roszak's 1932 self-portrait, made after his encounter with modernism in Europe, reflects a period of transition in the artist's life. He erased and repositioned his drawing hand, perhaps symbolizing a rethinking of his approach to art. The drawing retains the sinuous lines and fully realized forms of his earlier figural style, but the distorted eyes and the multiple, strangely patterned shirt collars reflect the influence of surrealism and cubism. Drawing was the wellspring of Roszak's art throughout his career, and a method for sorting out ideas. Drafting this image with characteristic care and skill, he applied countless strokes to the fingers to create a soft, luminous tone. The smooth modeling suggests the surfaces of the sleek abstract sculptures for which he later became famous.  "
61722,"Foster Dulles, as he was always called, was born and raised to be secretary of state; both his grandfather and uncle held that office. Serving in that capacity under Dwight D. Eisenhower, Dulles employed the heated rhetoric of anti-Communism, threatening to meet Soviet aggression with ""massive retaliation."" Yet he relied on international treaties and organizations to insure peace, and avoided actions in such hot spots as Vietnam, East Germany, and Hungary. He did, however, fight Communism by covert means, instigating coups in Iran and Guatemala, which were orchestrated by his brother Allen at the CIA. Dulles alienated many with his harsh rhetoric, but Eisenhower defended him, claiming that only ""one man I know . . . has seen more of the world . . . and knows more than he does-and that's me.""  "
61729,"In April 1865, Andrew Johnson (1808–1875) was thrust into a critical position of power; after a tumultuous four years of war in which Abraham Lincoln had historically expanded the powers of the presidency, Johnson, as president, became the victim of a Congress inclined to curtail his executive authority. A staunch believer in states’ rights, Johnson quickly antagonized Radical Republicans in Congress who felt his policies favored the civil rights of former Confederates at the expense of freed slaves. His vetoes of Reconstruction legislation that supported the rights of southern blacks, as caricatured in this print, and his violation of the Tenure of Office Act (later declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court) in removing Secretary of War Edwin Stanton from office, led to his impeachment in 1868. He was acquitted by a single vote."
61730,"On the night of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was attending the play Our American Cousin at Ford’s Theatre, accompanied by his wife and their guests, Major Henry R. Rathbone and his fiancée, Clara Harris. That evening, the guard assigned to the president had thought it safe to abandon his post. As a result, John Wilkes Booth found it relatively easy to enter Lincoln’s box and shoot him. As Booth leapt out of the box to the stage about twelve feet below, he caught the spur of his boot on a flag and broke his leg when he landed. Nevertheless, he escaped. It was not until twelve days later that Union soldiers cornered Booth in a barn in Caroline County, Virginia, where he died of a bullet wound. "
61799,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
61821,"The Woodbury Soap Company's innovative 1911 slogan, ""A skin you love to touch,"" focused on the consumer, not the product, and introduced sexual undertones to enhance the appeal of a basic face soap. In this 1940s ""stand-up"" poster for a drugstore window, Woodbury, still marketing with sex appeal, chose the actress Veronica Lake to promote its makeup. A successful leading lady for Paramount, Lake was one of Hollywood's darlings at the time. She was already a trendsetter; her blonde ""peekaboo"" hairstyle had launched a fashion craze for eye-covering curls. Here, in order to focus attention on her complexion, there is only a hint of an errant wave. With soft, peach-colored petals in the background to match the actress's exquisite face, and with Lake's plunging black tulle neckline, the ad promises the Woodbury consumer not only delicate femininity but also a touch of naughty Hollywood glamour.   "
61827,"Using the pen name Mark Twain, Samuel Clemens had become one of this country's favorite satiric writers by the early 1870s, routinely making light of everyday human foibles. But it was the publication of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1884) that assured him a lasting place in American letters. Inspired in part by his own boyhood, these two tales set along the Mississippi River did more than capture the rhythms of youth in antebellum America. In both novels, Clemens examined with sardonic wit various tensions that underlay contemporary society, including, most importantly, the question of race. In later years, his success in this country and abroad was tempered by financial and personal setbacks and by a contempt for American and British imperialism.  "
61873,"Born Fürth, Germany     Commissioned by Time magazine, Philip Pearlstein's portrait of Henry Kissinger appeared on the magazine's cover in conjunction with the release of the first volume of Kissinger's memoirs, The White House Years, in October 1979. In his book, Kissinger reflected on his career as assistant for national security affairs and secretary of state. Excerpts published in Time described his complicated relationship with President Richard Nixon, as well as the challenges of Cold War diplomacy.   Picturing Kissinger with a look of intense concentration, Pearlstein's portrait conveys his subject's seriousness of purpose and intellectual intensity, the same qualities reflected in his memoirs. The pose was no mere conceit. Unable to sit still for extended periods of time, Kissinger agreed to read while Pearlstein painted, thus enabling the artist to capture the very image of the statesman at work. "
61896,"Civil War sheet music  Civil War music usually fell into one of several categories: songs to rally the troops, spirituals sung by enslaved peoples, songs sung by families at home, and songs that reflected the homesickness many soldiers felt. The sheet music covers displayed here commemorate the lives of Confederates Jefferson Davis, Simon B. Buckner, and Stonewall Jackson, and Union general Ambrose Burnside."
61900,"Although any fictitious face would have passed as a likeness of Washington at the start of the American Revolution, an authentic image, based on a 1776 portrait by Charles Willson Peale, soon spread rapidly in prints and illustrations. Peale's own modest little mezzotint engraving of ""His Excellency Gen. Washington"" featured a long nose, almond-shaped eyes, and curls of hair at either side. That face was copied so frequently over the next two decades-appearing in engravings, books, magazines, almanacs, broadsides, and children's primers-that Washington's contemporaries recognized even the crudest versions. Various prints by engraver John Norman added cannon, banners, drums, and swags to the Peale image and were subsequently copied in relief for such ephemeral publications as The Federal Almanack. This unprecedented dissemination of a famous face suggests that Washington's legendary symbolic status began during his own lifetime."
61909,"To a great promoter like Colonel William F. Cody, the semireligious phrase ""I Am Coming"" required larger letters on this poster than the identification of the face that everyone would already recognize. Cody, originally a frontier scout, Indian fighter, and buffalo hunter, had become famous as the hero of ""Buffalo Bill"" dime novels and magazine stories. In 1882 he created his popular wild west show and toured as its star for thirty years, arguably doing more than any single American to popularize the myth of the West. Combining sharpshooting, riding, and roping with historical reenactments of war dances, buffalo hunts, stagecoach attacks, and ""Custer's Last Fight,"" Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show had enormous international appeal. In fact, this copy of the poster, bearing a French tax stamp (top right), is a testament to his extremely successful tours in France."
61918,"Born Berkeley, Charles County, Virginia  The first battle of the War of 1812 actually occurred in 1811, with the Battle of Tippecanoe in the Indiana wilderness. As governor of the territory, William Henry Harrison faced increased resistance from Indian tribes forced from their homes by new settlers. Harrison met with Shawnee warrior chief Tecumseh at a tense council that nearly ended in violence and led in part to Tecumseh’s alliance with the British during the subsequent war. With tensions rising, Tecumseh’s brother Tenskwatawa (the Prophet) attacked Harrison’s forces near Tippecanoe. The surprise strike resulted in heavy casualties for Harrison; however, the Indians left the field and Harrison then destroyed Tecumseh’s stronghold, Prophet’s Town, claiming the victory. A year later, Harrison commanded the American forces at the Battle of the Thames, where Tecumseh was killed. In 1840 the slogan “Tippecanoe and Tyler too!” propelled Harrison to the presidency. "
61995,"Known as the ""March King,"" John Philip Sousa created the brass band music that set the tempo for America's red-blooded parade into the twentieth century. As director of the Marine Band from 1880 to 1892, and then of the Sousa Band from 1892 to the end of his life, Sousa sought to compose and perform music that would capture a ""true American national air"" to express ""genuine American feeling,"" as he did in such marches as ""Semper Fidelis"" (1888), ""The Washington Post March"" (1889), and ""Stars and Stripes Forever"" (1897), and in the popular operetta El Capitan (1895). A brilliant showman, Sousa used his influence to help organize the American Society of Composers and Publishers (ASCAP) in 1914 to protect against copyright infringement. He also invented the sousaphone, a bass tuba with an upright bell."
62046,"Janis Joplin's first years out of high school were characterized by aimless drift. But somewhere along the line she began singing in coffeehouses, and in 1966 she accepted an invitation to be the lead vocalist for the San Francisco rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company. Habitués of local nightclubs loved her shrill, rasping style, and in 1967 she took the country by storm with her rendition of ""Love Is Like a Ball and Chain"" at the Monterey International Pop Festival.   Joplin performed with a draining ferocity and consumed large quantities of whiskey, both on and off the stage. That combination led many to think that she would soon burn out, but she shrugged, ""When I can't sing, I'll worry about it then."" That was something she never had to confront. In late 1970, Joplin died at age twenty-seven from a heroin overdose. "
62416,"Bolton-le-Moors, Lancashire, England    Artist Thomas Cole was a founder of the Hudson River School of American painting, which sought to record the sublime grandeur of the nation's natural landscape. Convinced that the highest art was that which conveyed a moral lesson, Cole achieved his greatest fame with two series of allegorical paintings entitled The Course of Empire (1836) and The Voyage of Life (1841). When the introduction of the daguerreotype led some to worry about the possible demise of painting, Cole dismissed such concerns by declaring, ""The invention will undoubtedly be one of great value-to the artist as a means of accumulating material."""
62541,"The Italian-born caricaturist Paolo Garretto knew Baker and claimed to have introduced her to her manager, Pepito Abatino. His collaged image of her, enlivened with a strip of wood veneer and threads of real feathers, conveys her beauty, athletic grace, and extraordinary vivacity. It was published in February 1936, in the last issue of Conde Nast's Vanity Fair, which featured brilliant, celebratory caricatures of international celebrities."
62549,"Born Wirsitz, Germany (now the Polish province of Poznan)    Although first attracted to the field of rocket science in the 1920s by his desire to make spaceflight a reality, Wernher von Braun spent his early career developing long-range missiles for military use. During World War II, he led Nazi Germany's successful effort to devise rocket weaponry, including the V-1 ""flying bomb"" and V-2 rocket-the world's first ballistic missile. After surrendering to American forces in May 1945, von Braun was contracted by the U.S. Army to apply his considerable expertise to the task of developing America's missile capabilities. A strong advocate for spaceflight development as well, he spearheaded planning in the 1950s for the nation's first manmade satellite. Following the creation of the civilian National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) in 1958, von Braun became chief architect of the booster rocket program that led to the first U.S. manned space flights and ultimately put American astronauts on the moon in July 1969."
62610,"Print used as frontispiece to first edition of Leaves of Grass, 1855    In this rough-hewn likeness, Whitman projected himself as a new kind of writer in a calculated act of romantic self-assertion. Whitman later wrote of it: ""I look so damned flamboyant, as if I was hurling bolts at somebody-full of mad oaths-saying defiantly, to hell with you!"" He published Leaves of Grass himself as a declaration of artistic independence on July 4, 1855. (Actually, Whitman was mythologizing himself with this claim; the book appeared on July 5.)   The poetry fulfilled the image, as Whitman went on to set his own rules:     From this hour I ordain myself loos'd of limits and     imaginary lines,    Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,    Listening to others, considering well what they say,    Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,    Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the     holds that would hold me.  "
62652,"Born London, England    Largely though his investigations of Britain's penal system, philanthropist James Oglethorpe came to see his country's American empire as a place for England's prisoners to gain a fresh start in life. In 1732, he acted on that conviction, setting sail for America with some 130 debtors and unemployed workers to establish the new colony of Georgia. As governor, Oglethorpe lost no time in introducing measures to promote harmony within his settlement. His first acts included a ban on rum and a law guaranteeing equitable treatment of the region's native peoples. In 1743 he returned permanently to England, although he continued to act as governor until 1752, when the powers of his royal charter reverted back to the king. Thomas Burford's mezzotint depicts Georgia's governor in military dress and was meant to commemorate his armed attempts to keep Spanish authorities out of Florida."
62653,"This portrait of Seminole Indian chief Billy Bowlegs (also known as Holata Micco) shows the American fascination with portraying American Indians. Bowlegs was one of the last, most resistant Seminole War leaders, fighting in both the Second and Third Seminole Wars. Hostilities concluded in 1842 but broke out again in 1855 when the U.S. Army moved into Bowlegs’s territory in Florida. He responded by waging guerrilla warfare. Subdued by 1858, he and his followers were removed west of Arkansas, where he became a prominent landowner. In moving west, Bowlegs passed through New Orleans, where John Hawley Clarke took the original version of this portrait. Clarke had established a studio in that city by 1856."
62708,"Born near Lexington, Kentucky    In the presidential campaign of 1856, John C. Breckinridge became James Buchanan's running mate. During Breckinridge's subsequent vice-presidential tenure, he was a spokesman for national unity in the bitter sectional debates that were fast moving the country toward civil war. In the four-way election of 1860, Breckinridge was the presidential candidate of the Southern Democrats. Even when Lincoln's victory set the South on its course toward secession, he continued to urge unity. Yet once secession was accomplished, Breckinridge joined the new Confederacy and served as a general in the Confederate army. In the last months of the Civil War, Breckinridge became the Confederacy's fifth secretary of war. When Richmond fell in early April 1865, he arranged for the military and government records of the Confederacy to be surrendered intact, and these are now housed in the National Archives.  "
62796,"Seven Ages of Man  The Meade Brothers exhibited numerous examples of their work at the ""Great Exhibition"" held in New York City’s Crystal Palace (1853–54), including a series of daguerreotypes by Charles Meade illustrating Shakespeare’s ""seven ages,"" as described in Act II of As You Like It. Lauded by the Photographic Art Journal for reflecting ""much talent"" and ""a high degree of cultivated taste,"" the Meade Brothers’ Seven Ages of Man—Infant, Schoolboy, Lover, Soldier, Justice, Pantaloon, and Second Childishness—later circulated in the form of card-mounted photographs known as cartes de visite."
62805,"One of the first prints of the Confederate military, this lithograph was issued by the French firm of Goupil in about 1861. It contained outdated likenesses of several officers, notably Robert E. Lee, and included such officers as Thomas J. Simmons, whose prominence would quickly fade. Likewise, because the lithograph was printed early in the war, it did not include future greats like Stonewall Jackson and A. P. Hill, who had yet to distinguish themselves."
62839,"Elaine de Kooning sometimes made detailed pencil drawings during the 1950s as the starting point for one or more paintings of her subjects. This precise rendering of Willem de Kooning is related to at least one painting, now unlocated. Its casual pose, with Willem holding a glass or can and another container on the ground, is typical of Elaine’s candid, informal approach to portraiture. She has used the drawing to sketch out a compositional arrangement and to delineate Willem’s characteristic features with fluid pencil strokes.  En los años cincuenta, Elaine de Kooning solía hacer dibujos detallados a lápiz como punto de partida para una o más pinturas del mismo sujeto. Esta imagen fiel de Willem de Kooning se ha relacionado con por lo menos una pintura (sin localizar hasta la fecha). La pose relajada de Willem, con un vaso o lata en la mano y otro en el suelo, es típica del tono cándido e informal con que Elaine aborda el retratismo. La artista usó el dibujo para definir una composición y delinear con trazos fluidos los rasgos característicos de Willem."
63001,"From her beginnings in vaudeville, Josephine Baker exhibited a verve and sensuality that stood out even in a chorus line. Having grown up in poverty in St. Louis, she seized the opportunity in 1925 to travel to Paris in the Harlem music and dance ensemble La Revue Nègre. With a reputation for daring outfits and a performance style that was at once erotic and comic, Baker became a star. Ernest Hemingway, who regularly frequented the Club Joséphine, where Baker served as ""hostess,"" called her ""the most sensational woman anyone ever saw . . . or ever will."" After the outbreak of World War II, Baker threw herself behind the Allied cause, working with refugees and performing for the troops. In later years she became a vocal civil rights proponent, insisting on integrated audiences wherever she performed."
63013,"Portraiture became part of the mourning process that followed Abraham Lincoln's assassination on April 14, 1865. In the ensuing months, print publishers furnished the image of Lincoln in all guises: attended at his deathbed by various statesmen, sitting serenely with his family, or grouped with previous American heroes or presidents. But first, a shocked nation had to grapple with the facts of his assassination and death. The lithograph of the scene at Ford's Theatre re-creates the event, with John Wilkes Booth leaping to the stage after shooting Lincoln. The black-bordered Memento Mori recalls many Americans' first grieving response: to drape funereal bunting, crepe, and flags on doors and windows, often tucking a portrait into the decorations.  "
63016,"As this wood engraving suggests, Abraham Lincoln was just one of several candidates who were in contention for the Republican Party's nomination for president in 1860. Moreover, at the start of the convention in May, he was not even one of the favorites. Many believed that William Henry Seward, the party's chief spokesman against slavery and a former governor of New York (center picture), stood the best chance, including Seward himself. But Lincoln bested them all. After he was elected president, Lincoln selected four of his rivals pictured here to serve in his cabinet. They included Seward for secretary of state, Edward Bates for attorney general, Salmon P. Chase for secretary of treasury, and Simon Cameron for secretary of war. "
63035,"  The end of the Civil War saw the passage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Respectively, they abolished slavery, guaranteed citizenship to all persons born in the United States, and granted the right to vote to male citizens, regardless of ""race, color, or previous condition of servitude."" The Fifteenth Amendment was especially significant because for the first time in the nation's history, a minority class was empowered. ""A man with a ballot in his hand is the master of the situation,"" wrote former abolitionist Wendell Phillips.  This hand-colored lithograph commemorates the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment and the national celebration held in Baltimore."
63066,"George Washington died nearly forty years before the introduction of the daguerreian process, so there are no original daguerreotypes of America's first president. Daguerreotypes were made, however, of Gilbert Stuart's famous unfinished painting of Washington, which was acquired in 1831 by the Boston Athenaeum and is now jointly owned by the National Portrait Gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. This daguerreotype of the ""Athenaeum"" portrait is the work of pioneering daguerreotypist John A. Whipple. It predates by several years daguerreotypes of the same Washington portrait made by Whipple's rivals-fellow Boston-based daguerreians Albert Sands Southworth and Josiah Johnson Hawes. "
63089,"Harold Rosenberg (1906–1978) was a poet and art critic; his most famous essay, ""The American Action Painters"" (1952), championed abstract painting, including that of Willem de Kooning. He affirmed the painter’s canvas ""as an arena in which to act—rather than as a space in which to reproduce, re-design, analyze or ‘express’ an object, actual or imagined. What was to go on the canvas was not a picture but an event.""  The de Koonings had known Rosenberg and his wife, May Tabak, since the 1940s, and Elaine painted and drew him many times. This painting is the largest and most complex, depicting the critic stretched out in her studio, filling the canvas, and holding a beverage can in one hand and a cigarette in the other. Elaine combined fluid drawing with dark paint and broadly brushed areas of colorful pigment to create equilibrium between bodily likeness and pure abstraction.    Harold Rosenberg (1906–1978) fue un poeta y crítico de arte. Su ensayo más famoso, “Los pintores de acción norteamericanos” (1952), es una defensa de la pintura abstracta, incluida la de Willem de Kooning. Afirmaba que el lienzo de un pintor era un “lugar donde se actúa, no un espacio para reproducir, rediseñar, analizar o ‘expresar’ un objeto, sea real o imaginario. Lo que debe ir en el lienzo no es una imagen, sino un suceso”.  Los De Kooning conocían a Rosenberg y su esposa, May Tabak, desde los años cuarenta; de hecho, Elaine lo pintó y dibujó en numerosas ocasiones. Esta pintura es la más compleja y de mayor formato. El crítico aparece recostado en el estudio de ella, llenando el espacio del lienzo, con una lata de alguna bebida en una mano y un cigarrillo en la otra. Elaine combina áreas oscuras de dibujo fluido con áreas de pinceladas amplias en pigmentos coloridos para crear equilibrio entre el parecido físico y la abstracción pura."
63095,"Rear Admiral David Dixon Porter came from a naval family and became a midshipman in 1829, serving in a variety of theaters, including the Mediterranean. Service in the peacetime military was slow, boring, and devoid of opportunities to make one’s mark. Porter did well in the Mexican American War, obtaining a bigger command and a promotion, but afterward military service resumed its slow pace. Galvanized by the outbreak of the Civil War, Porter devised a plan to resupply the federal forts in Florida and then spearheaded the naval assault on New Orleans. He was also singularly successful in the combined operation—commanded by Ulysses Grant on land—to take Vicksburg. Thereafter, Porter had few opportunities to shine, and combined Union navy-army operations off North Carolina were not distinguished. Porter saw out the end of the war on his flagship anchored in the James River, as Gardner pictured him here."
63184,"Born Athens, Ohio    One of the most moving and popular monuments in that city of monuments, Washington, D.C., is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Situated just north of the Lincoln Memorial, its V-shaped walls dig into the landscape like a scar, testifying to the way in which the Vietnam War has marked the body politic. Yet the ""wall,"" on which are inscribed the names of more than 50,000 of the dead, is also a place of memory and healing. Astoundingly, the memorial's designer, chosen in 1981 through a blind competition, was a Yale undergraduate named Maya Lin. Lin's abstract design, let alone her youth, caused controversy (as, unfortunately, did her ancestry as a Chinese American), but the memorial was ultimately built, albeit with the addition of a sculpture depicting a representational group of soldiers set to the side. Lin has gone on to have a successful career as an architect who specializes in civic memorials.  "
63188,"Journalist Alexander Woollcott urged his friend Soss Melik to make portraits commemorating American writers, and he helped to arrange a sitting with Thomas Wolfe, the renowned author of Look Homeward, Angel. Melik later wrote that ""since [Wolfe] seemed to rest his massive shoulders and arms by holding on to his suspenders . . . it was a logical and characteristic gesture."" At the time the portrait was made, the young writer was agitated over his professional separation from longtime friend and editor Maxwell Perkins, who had helped wrestle his voluminous manuExhibition scripts into publishable form. Melik captured the intensity and emotional energy of this giant of a man, who later that year would suffer a fatal illness. Although Melik's deft charcoal sketching does not suggest modern style, the candor of the sitter's informal pose and defiant attitude seems quite contemporary."
63222,"Revolutionary War colonel John Stevens, trained in the law and self-educated as an engineer, was a pioneer in steam-engine experimentation. In 1804 his small steamboat, Little Juliana, operated by twin-screw propellers, made a successful trip across the Hudson and back to the New Jersey shore. Barred by the monopoly held by Robert Fulton from operating on the Hudson River, Stevens in 1808 sent his paddle steamer Phoenix-the first completely American-built steam engine-to Philadelphia by sea and opened a steamship line between that city and Trenton. In 1825 Stevens designed the first American-built steam locomotive, operating it, at the rate of over twelve miles per hour, on a circular track on his estate in Hoboken to demonstrate the feasibility of steam (as a replacement for horses) to power railroad transportation.  "
63229,"Civil War sheet music  Civil War music usually fell into one of several categories: songs to rally the troops, spirituals sung by enslaved peoples, songs sung by families at home, and songs that reflected the homesickness many soldiers felt. The sheet music covers displayed here commemorate the lives of Confederates Jefferson Davis, Simon B. Buckner, and Stonewall Jackson, and Union general Ambrose Burnside."
63307,"In 1846, the newspaperman John L. O'Sullivan coined the phrase ""manifest destiny"" to describe America's mission to ""overspread the continent allotted [to us] by Providence."" A member of the U.S. Topographical Corps, the ""Great Pathfinder"" John C. Frémont made that destiny a reality with his many explorations of western routes to the Pacific. In 1846-47, Frémont fought to capture California from Mexico, but his insubordination led to his dismissal from service, an act that only added to his appeal as spokesman for western Americans. Personally and politically well-connected (he was the son-in-law of powerful Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton), Frémont was a senator from California and then ran for president in 1856 as the Republican Party's first candidate. He was an unsuccessful Civil War general, losing Abraham Lincoln's confidence when he issued a premature announcement emancipating Missouri's slaves.  "
63336,"The first woman to run as a major party's vice-presidential candidate, Geraldine Ferraro was teamed with Democratic presidential candidate Walter Mondale in a bid to unseat Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush in 1984. Ferraro had served three successive terms in the House of Representatives beginning in 1978, compiling a liberal voting record on social and economic issues. Just after her nomination, Time magazine featured her on its cover as a ""historic choice."" In a campaign that ended in a Reagan landslide, perhaps the most memorable moment came when Barbara Bush was asked what she thought of Ferraro, and said, ""I can't say it, but it rhymes with rich."" Ferraro later served as ambassador to the United Nations Committee on Human Rights."
63369,"Regarded as one of the most important playwrights of her time, Lillian Hellman experienced her first theatrical success in 1934 with the Broadway production of The Children's Hour, her dark drama about false allegations of lesbianism in a girls school. Her greatest triumph was The Little Foxes, first staged in 1939. Unlike many plays that become dated over time, this carefully crafted tale of intrafamily greed garnered a critical respect that proved enduring. ""It was like a Chinese box,"" one of its admirers noted after teaching it for many years in a college class, ""each piece fitting precisely with the next."" The winner of the prestigious Drama Critics Award in 1960 for Toys in the Attic, Hellman turned in later years to writing three volumes of memoirs which, though not scrupulously truthful, elicited some of the best reviews she ever received."
63470,"Born Epworth, South Carolina     A passionate believer in the power of education, Benjamin Mays left South Carolina, where his parents were tenant farmers, in 1916 to attend Bates College in Maine. After earning MA and PhD degrees from the University of Chicago, he taught at Howard University in Washington, D.C. In 1940 he became president of Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he served until 1967. There he taught and befriended Martin Luther King Jr. and had the sad duty of giving the eulogy at his funeral in 1968. King called him “my spiritual mentor and my intellectual father.” Photographer Griffith Davis was a student at Morehouse; he photographed Mays as he waited for a train to Atlanta at New York City’s Penn Station."
63482,"Brake, which recognizes the contributions of Apollo 1 astronauts Virgil ""Gus"" Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee, was created in 1969 by Robert Rauschenberg as part of Stoned Moon, a lithographic series the artist devoted to the first lunar landing. Grissom, White, and Chaffee became the first American astronauts to lose their lives while on duty when their space capsule burst into flames during a training session in January 1967. The tragedy shook the nation and led to a reassessment of the space program. But the deaths of these space pioneers also reaffirmed the importance of continuing the moon shot, which culminated in July 1969 with the safe touchdown and return of Apollo 11. In a strange but fitting coincidence, the lower segment of the lithographic stone used to print Brake cracked during the proofing process. Rauschenberg embraced this chance occurrence and printed the stone in this fashion. "
63493,"Throughout their careers, the Meade Brothers photographed countless stage celebrities, from the American dramatic actor Edwin Forrest to Jenny Lind, the singer hailed as ""the Swedish Nightingale."" In this portrait, most likely made while the brothers’ operations were based in Albany, Henry Meade appears costumed as though for a role in a Shakespearean production. "
63495,"Red Grooms’s witty portrait of Willem de Kooning (1904–1997) celebrates the achievements of this important abstract expressionist painter. Replete with visual puns, the work has de Kooning literally “breaking through” the surface of Grooms’s print, suggesting the transformative nature of de Kooning’s contribution to the history of art. Grooms’s imagery specifically references de Kooning’s Woman and Bicycle (1952–53), one of a series of Woman paintings that integrated popular culture imagery, such as pinup girls and advertisements, into a fine art context and bridged the divide between abstraction and figuration.   Similar dynamics animate Grooms’s lithograph. With its sense of playfulness, frenetic movement, and violent tearing of paper, the portrait suggests the humor and energy of an animated cartoon. Combined with the brushwork of action painting and the unexpected three-dimensional folding of paper, Grooms creates a likeness as layered with cultural references as de Kooning’s own paintings."
63496,"Davidson traveled to France at the end of World War I to sculpt portraits of the victorious Allied leaders for a ""plastic history"" that he planned. Edward M. House was President Woodrow Wilson's close personal adviser and sat for his portrait at the time of the Versailles peace conference. Imitating another of Davidson's sitters, House signed the clay version of the portrait. Regarding his career at this time, Davidson later wrote, ""The speed with which one sitter replaced another, each being a distinct personality, taught me to simplify more and extract the essentials needed to make a portrait.""  "
63501,"Born Lancaster, Ohio     Remembered most for his “scorched earth” marches through Georgia and the Carolinas during the last months of the Civil War, William T. Sherman emerged from the conflict the most acclaimed Union general after Ulysses S. Grant. For many southerners, however, the name Sherman had become infamous. In 1869 he succeeded Grant as the U.S. Army’s top commander, a position he held until 1883. For most of those years he focused on protecting settlers in the West, and the railroads, from Indian incursions. In 1875 he published his memoirs; the second edition appeared ten years later, with the image shown here on the frontispiece. It was a favorite of his and depicts him about the time of his retirement from the army. "
63502,"Thirtieth president, 1923-29    Americans expect their presidents to be active, which explains why Calvin Coolidge has been labeled by historians as the ""quiet president"" and an ""American enigma."" Coolidge was propelled to national prominence, and the vice presidency, by his decision, while governor of Massachusetts, to fire striking officers in Boston's police strike of 1919, proclaiming, ""there is no right to strike against the public safety by anybody, anywhere, any time."" Assuming the presidency after Warren Harding's death in 1923, Coolidge determined not to do anything to upset American prosperity. Upon election to the presidency, Coolidge, in his 1925 inaugural address-the first on radio-expressed his belief that ""the people of America [should] . . . work less for the government and more for themselves. . . . That is the chief meaning of freedom."" When Coolidge left office, political commentator Walter Lippmann wrote, ""Surely no one will write of those years . . . that an aggressive president altered the destiny of the Republic. Yet . . . no one will write . . . that the Republic wished its destiny to be altered."""
63518,"In Irving Penn's portrait, Duchamp, in a suit and with his signature pipe in his mouth, looks much like one of the models that Penn regularly photographed for Vogue. Like many of his contemporaries, Duchamp had left France during World War II and was living in New York when Penn took his portrait. Remaining in the United States, he became increasingly visible in the New York art scene. His Large Glass (1915-23) was displayed at the Museum of Modern Art in 1943, and a photograph of Duchamp seen through this same work appeared on the cover of Vogue in 1945. Penn's portrait captures Duchamp's charm and good looks, embodying fellow artist André Breton's observation that ""Marcel Duchamp [is] the only one of all his contemporaries who is in no way inclined to grow older.""   "
63538,"Born Chicago, Illinois  After more than a decade on the vaudeville circuit, ventriloquist Edgar Bergen and his wisecracking wooden cohort Charlie McCarthy rocketed to national fame in 1936 with their radio debut on the Rudy Vallee Show. The monocled dummy and his human straight man proved so popular with the listening audience that when NBC gave the pair their own program in 1937, it quickly became one of radio’s top-rated shows. One reviewer credited the success of the act to Bergen’s ability to endow an ""inanimate bit of timber"" with ""as distinct and as assertive an individuality"" as any entertainer in show business. Although other characters such as country bumpkin Mortimer Snerd were later added to the act, the irrepressible Charlie McCarthy remained its star. When Bergen announced his intention to one day donate his rambunctious alter ego to the Smithsonian, Charlie fired back, ""Well, I won’t be the only dummy in Washington."""
63583,"Born Louisville, Kentucky  Few American boxers have possessed athletic talents comparable to those of Muhammad Ali, nor could many equal him for charisma and bravado. Turning professional after a gold medal win at the 1960 Olympics, Ali (born Cassius Clay) attained the heavyweight crown in 1964. His skill, along with his words and actions outside the ring—including outrageous boasts in poetic verse—won him a huge international following. However, controversy ensued when he joined the Nation of Islam and refused to serve in Vietnam, and he was stripped of his title. After being reinstated, Ali would reclaim the heavyweight crown, lose it, and regain it again before retiring in 1981. Ali was an ideal subject for one of Andy Warhol’s explorations of fame. But instead of showing the shallow surface of mass media–driven consumer culture, Warhol depicted Ali in an unexpectedly quiet, introspective pose. "
63634,"Lillian Gish never had the aura of glamour that other early Hollywood leading ladies enjoyed, and many actresses surpassed her as box office draws. Nevertheless, Gish may well deserve pride of place as the most capable actress of the silent-screen era, and her performances in such films as Broken Blossoms and The Scarlet Letter number among the most memorable moments of early American filmmaking. The movie with which Gish is perhaps most often associated is director D. W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation, the movie industry's first feature-length drama, released in 1915.  In this photograph by Alfred Cheney Johnston, Gish is dressed for her role in Orphans of the Storm, the last of her many films made with Griffith. After the movie's completion, Griffith urged her to go to other moviemakers for parts because he could not pay her what she was worth."
63641,"On June 7, 1776, it fell to Richard Henry Lee, delegate from Virginia at the Second Continental Congress, to offer the resolution that ""these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States.""   Lee was a tobacco planter and a seasoned member of the Virginia House of Burgesses. An aristocrat with an innate sense of his natural rights, Lee had long fought England's attempts to undermine colonial liberties. From the time he first came to Congress, he had used his powerful oratory to unite his colleagues in resistance to British tyranny. Absent in Virginia (where he was helping with the formation of a new state government) when his resolution was adopted on July 2, Lee later returned to sign the Declaration of Independence.  "
63682,"During an age when social conventions limited the opportunities for women, author Charlotte Perkins Gilman was influential in exposing the problems that lay behind the sentimental facade of domesticity. She achieved an international reputation with the publication of Women and Economics (1898), a book that highlighted the importance of economics in shaping relationships between men and women. Her critique of patriarchal power was in part rooted in her own traumatic experiences as a child and a young wife. Most famously, her chilling short story ""The Yellow Wallpaper"" dramatized the repressive treatment she received during a period of depression following the birth of her first child. More typically, Gilman's writings focused on specific reforms for everyday living, from child-rearing to women's dress. This portrait sketch shows her as a young woman before her rise to prominence.  "
63707,"Born near Bel Air, Maryland     Cartes de visite, such as this one of actor—and later assassin—John Wilkes Booth, were popular, inexpensive souvenirs distributed by the actors themselves and collected by admirers at the time of the Civil War.    "
63800,"Whitman famously wrote, ""The real war will never get in the books."" At best, the immediacy of combat would disappear as people tried to make sense of the conflict as a historical event. At worst, the Civil War would be prettified and distorted by a Victorian culture that, like the amputee in ""The Wound Dresser,"" could not face its scars directly. But the war remained a violently contested issue of national politics. And it never left the memories and dreams of those who had seen it close up.        Long have they pass'd, faces and trenches and fields,    Where through the carnage I moved with a callous     composure, or away from the fallen,    Onward I sped at the time-but now of their forms at     night, I dream, I dream, I dream.       From ""Old War-Dreams"" (1865-66)  "
63826,"Born Glasgow, Scotland    In 1825 reformer and social theorist Robert Dale Owen traveled to the United States to assist his father in establishing New Harmony-a cooperative, utopian community in Indiana. The New Harmony experiment proved to be short-lived, and Owen later allied himself with the ""Free Enquirers,"" a liberal group that championed an early form of socialism. In 1842 Owen was elected to Congress, where one of his most important acts was to introduce the bill establishing the Smithsonian Institution. True to his egalitarian principles, Owen insisted that the Smithsonian take as its mission both the increase of knowledge and its popular dissemination."
63837,"Born Paris, France     Born into a family of privilege, Diana Vreeland worked her way up the fashion print industry to become the tastemaker in American and European fashion for nearly fifty years. She honed a distinct voice, penning Harper’s Bazaar’s “Why Don’t You” column in 1936—an irreverent call for decadent behavior during the Depression era. After several decades as fashion editor there, she was appointed editor in chief for American Vogue, serving from 1962 to 1971. There, she initiated the 1960s “Youthquake” by bringing in such new talent as teenaged model Twiggy and photographer Richard Avedon. After being fired from Vogue, Vreeland continued to be a force in the fashion world as the visionary behind the critically acclaimed exhibitions at the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.   Levine emphasizes Vreeland’s severe sartorial and editing habits in this caricature with the stark lines of her dress, her pose, and her most powerful accessory—her judgmental gaze."
63874,"Born Detroit, Michigan    Stanley Glaubach's bust of Richard Nixon's campaign manager and attorney general, John Mitchell, makes him appear invulnerable. But when the Senate opened its hearings into the Watergate scandal in May 1973, Mitchell's reputation would soon crumble as the extent of his participation in the conspiracy became fully known. In the White House, Mitchell was an advocate of using any means to defeat the administration's opponents, both real and imagined, and his central role in both planning the break-in and stonewalling the subsequent investigation was soon revealed. He was convicted on charges of conspiracy, obstruction, and perjury; he served eighteen months in prison."
63877,"When Paine posed for George Romney during the summer of 1792, he had hopes that Rights of Man would do for England what Common Sense had done for America and was exhilarated by its distribution among the lower classes. His supporters, grumbled Hannah More, one of those who gave answer to Paine, ""load asses with their pernicious pamphlets and . . . get them dropped, not only in cottages, and in highways, but into mines and coal-pits.""    The original oil painting has been lost, but this engraving by William Sharp fast became the most familiar image of Paine. Both Romney and Sharp were among Paine's circle of radical English reformers.   "
63889,"In 1914 expressionist poet Robinson Jeffers settled in Carmel, California. Davidson sculpted him there in 1930 at the home of their mutual friend Lincoln Steffens. Davidson saw Jeffers as ""what I always imagined a poet should look like-tall, handsome, shy and silent, moving about under a sort of spell."" Jeffers signed the finished clay portrait and later pronounced the bronze version ""extraordinarily like . . ., more so in the bronze than it was in the clay. So now we have a solider [more solid] immortality than verses can make."""
63933,"In the late 1960s Jimi Hendrix carried the blues into the twenty-first century by turning the electric guitar into an instrument of vast capabilities and poetic expression. Through a brilliant manipulation of feedback and amplification, Hendrix created soundscapes of deep texture and distortion, of electronic waves and wah-wah. Often dressed in a rainbow riot of color, he wrote songs about other planets and experiences that fit the era’s hallucinogenic experiences and its mythology of alternate dimensions. On stage he was simultaneously self-possessed and otherworldly, playing the guitar with his teeth and behind his back, even setting it on fire. Born of mixed white, black, and Cherokee ancestry, Hendrix was influenced by Elvis, Little Richard, and Muddy Waters; honed his blues chops on the ""chitlin’ circuit""; and recorded with the Isley Brothers and King Curtis. His searing instrumental version of the national anthem is a rare example of nonverbal social protest and remains the iconic sound of Woodstock."
63948,"Like Ira Aldridge, Edwin Forrest debuted on the stage as Othello; but unlike the African American actor, Forrest caused a sensation and became one of the American theater's first great actors. Forrest brought a new naturalism to the American stage, one that exemplified the strength and vigor of the American character. In this portrait he is shown as Metamora, ""an original of this country,"" the Indian hero of a play commissioned by Forrest himself.  Forrest became a symbol of American nationalism in the ethnically charged atmosphere of the 1830s and 1840s. In 1849 a nativist mob of his supporters attacked New York's Astor Place Theater, where the English actor William Macready was performing. A panicked police force could not control the riot, and twenty-two people were killed in the melee.  "
63959,"By 1937, when Clark Gable and Jean Harlow posed for this promotional picture for their film Saratoga, both were at their box office peaks. Harlow established herself as Hollywood's leading sex goddess with her performance in Hell's Angels in 1931, but she really came into her own in 1933 with Bombshell, in which her brilliant parody of her own siren's reputation revealed a substantial gift for comedy. One of MGM's top stars, Gable had already won a best-actor Oscar for It Happened One Night, and he would soon be tapped for his most celebrated role, the rakish Rhett Butler in the 1939 screen epic Gone with the Wind. Gable and Harlow shared top billing in a number of pictures. Unfortunately, Saratoga would be their last co-starring venture. Two months before the picture's release, Harlow died from uremic poisoning."
64110,"Born Kirkwood, Missouri    Author of more than a dozen volumes of verse, Marianne Moore received virtually every major literary award—including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award—that the United States had to offer. Moore was acclaimed by her contemporaries, including T. S. Eliot, who cited the “original sensibility and alert intelligence” of her poetry. Using unconventional metrical schemes and focusing on such no-nonsense virtues as courage, loyalty, and patience, her innovative and exquisitely crafted verse secured her a leading position among modernist writers.              This portrait by Marguerite Zorach—Marianne Moore and Her Mother—redolent with the bright fauvist colors and faceted cubist planes that the artist picked up from four years in Paris, records Moore at an important moment in her rise to fame. Moore’s mother played a significant role in her work as an editor. Although the canvas bears a date of 1919, recent scholarship suggests that sittings likely took place in 1925."
64137,"In 1832, Harvard-educated minister Ralph Waldo Emerson resigned his post at Boston's Second Congregational Church in a crisis of faith. Having cast off doctrine, Emerson went on in his voluminous writings to create a uniquely American school of philosophy, which harkened back to Thomas Paine's revolutionary politics of ""Common Sense"" and anticipated William James's pragmatism. In Emerson's system, man approached God (embodied in nature) on his own, taking responsibility for his own salvation. Emerson preached self-reliance as Americans' core attribute; this empowered the individual in a way that led to dreams of perfectionism and supported the culture of American business."
64221,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
64282,"Jane Addams was among the first of the college-educated women of the late nineteenth century to escape the social and cultural constraints limiting professional women to teaching and missionary work. As low wages, long hours, and wretched living conditions became the norm for America's urban industrial workers, many, including Addams, were disturbed by the specter of a permanently oppressed lower class ruled by a privileged elite. In 1889, Addams, having admired settlement houses (neighborhood social welfare centers) in London, established Hull-House in a Chicago slum, the second settlement house in the United States. Within a decade, it offered practical education and a myriad of opportunities to the poor. With the sponsorship of Chicago's wealthy women, Hull-House became the most influential and innovative of the 400 settlement houses in the United States before World War I.  "
64283,"Whitman's Specimen Days and Collect (1882), his reminiscences of the Civil War and after, is divided between clear-eyed descriptions of war and peaceful nature writing. Writing about butterflies-""now and then some gorgeous fellow flashing lazily by on wings like artists' palettes""-Whitman maintained that these flighty insects could be trained: ""I have one big and handsome moth down here . . . [who] likes me to hold him up on my extended hand."" This charming photograph reenacts this event, demonstrating the poet's literal connection with nature-although with a cardboard butterfly.     Whitman was always happy to have his picture taken, although he professed himself never satisfied with the results. ""I've been photographed, photographed, and photographed until the cameras themselves are tired of me. . . . I've run the whole gamut of photographic fol-de-rol.""       Author: D. Ward"
64329,"Thirty-eighth President, 1974-77    The relaxed, take-charge air of confidence that characterizes this photograph of Gerald Ford was published on Time's cover in August 1976. The picture accompanied a story reporting Ford's chances of claiming the presidential nomination at the forthcoming Republican convention in Kansas City. The prognosis for a Ford victory, Time noted, was excellent. Indeed, thanks to his chief rival Ronald Reagan's pre-convention selection of a liberal Republican as a running mate, the delegate support was running so favorably for Ford that it seemed likely that he would win the nomination on the first ballot.  Photographer Dirck Halstead began his career at the age of seventeen with a photographic spread for Life on the revolution in Guatemala. When he took this picture of Ford, he was serving as Time's White House photographer.    Time cover, August 9, 1976"
64392,"Film comedian Buster Keaton is both behind the camera and in the spotlight in this image, made by French poster designer Jean-Albert Mercier at a time when Keaton claimed his silent movies actually did a bigger business in Europe than in America. This poster for Keaton's movie The Cameraman attracts attention with brilliant colors and clever geometric stylization of forms. But it also advertises the latest film by incorporating two of the actor's trademarks: the deadpan, expressionless face and a lively chase scene pitting the agile human figure against relentless mechanical forces. The latter is suggested by a circle of sketches expressing speed and motion in a never-ending contest. In Keaton's movies, James Agee wrote in his 1949 appraisal of silent film comics, ""it seems that the whole universe is in exquisite flying motion and the one point of repose is [Keaton's] effortless, uninterested face."""
64400,"Born Lexington, Kentucky  Laura Clay grew up in a household where injustice was not tolerated. The daughter of prominent Kentucky abolitionist Cassius M. Clay, she followed in her father’s footsteps as an activist. As founding president of the Kentucky Woman Suffrage Association, she led the organization’s successful drives for repeal of Kentucky laws that circumscribed women’s property rights. This drawing is part of a series documenting the National American Woman Suffrage Association’s forty-fourth annual convention for McLure’s Magazine. Clay thought of her suffrage work as sacred, declaring, ""[T]his work is God’s cause and He is the leader of all our campaigns."" Clay’s commitment to states’ rights was at times difficult to reconcile with her support of the national association, as she supported state suffrage for white women only. She complained bitterly in published articles about the organization’s concentration of power in New York, targeting convention leader Dr. Anna Shaw, as well as Carrie Chapman Catt."
64433,"In the 1920s and 1930s the flame-haired entertainer known as ""Bricktop"" reigned as the cabaret queen of Paris, where her chic nightclub attracted the cream of the café society set. Raised in Chicago, Ada Smith got her start in vaudeville and then worked as a saloon singer in the Windy City until 1922, when she moved on to Harlem. Dubbed ""Bricktop"" by the owner of one of that district's popular nightspots, she performed in Harlem clubs until 1924, when she seized the opportunity to take her career to Paris. Embraced by that city's cadre of American expatriates, she opened her first Chez Bricktop nightclub in 1926. There, she not only charmed a clientele that included Cole Porter, Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway, but helped to nurture the careers of such performers as Mabel Mercer and Josephine Baker."
64461,"Adalbert Volck’s adopted state of Maryland was a border state lying between the Mason-Dixon Line to the North and the Potomac River to the South, two symbolic demarcations separating the country. While the northern border was more ideological in significance, the Potomac truly presented a physical barrier between the Union and Confederacy, as seen in this lithograph."
64497,"“The most satisfactory likeness.”     Despite his reputation as an expert speaker in everything from joke-telling to formal oratory, Lincoln was very careful about what he said and was, in fact, very reticent about speaking in public, especially extemporaneously. He frequently disappointed crowds at serenades and other informal events by not doing much more than greeting them. He did not want to speak off the cuff and risk being misunderstood.  Lincoln was aware of the power of words, so he husbanded them for maximum impact, and subjected his major speeches and state papers to many revisions. Lincoln also had a larger sense that it was not fitting for the president to speak too much, especially on informal matters. To keep himself—literally—in the public eye, Lincoln relied on photographs of himself, not words.   "
64502,"Encouraged by victories of the black civil rights movement, labor organizer César Chávez began in the early 1960s to protest the unfair treatment of farm workers in California and the Southwest, the majority of whom were Mexican or Mexican American. In 1963 he and Dolores Huerta founded the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), the first effective national organization to represent agricultural workers and press for political reform. The UFW started a boycott of California grapes in 1965 as part of a movement to improve working conditions for field laborers. Four years later, Time magazine published this portrait as its cover image. The effects of the farm workers' strike, known as la causa (the cause), had spread, resulting in a national boycott of grapes by many sympathetic Americans. An Aztec eagle, the symbol of the UFW, is emblazoned on Chávez's shirt."
64503,"In 1966, when Julia Child appeared on the cover of Time, she was enjoying the zenith of her long career as a chef and bestselling author. Her first book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking (1961), had become a popular classic. When the cover story appeared, Child was hosting a half-hour Emmy-winning program, The French Chef, which aired on public television. The show was popular with cooks and non-cooks alike chiefly because of Child’s appealing and unflappable personality. Her legions of loyal fans loved her adventures and misadventures in the kitchen. Yet at least two readers of Time took issue with her cover portrait, which Chaliapin had made from life sketches. According to one critic, Child’s head, framed with copper pots, cooking utensils, and a fish, ""resembles the First Apparition in Shakespeare’s Macbeth."""
64518,"Born Atlanta, Georgia     Walter White headed the NAACP from 1931 to 1955. During these difficult years, he directed an unsuccessful struggle for an anti-lynching bill and implemented a long-range campaign of legal actions culminating in the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing discrimination in the nation's schools. White's tenure at the NAACP saw it through the Depression, when membership and donations declined precipitously and it faced a strong challenge from the Communist Party-USA, which actively competed for African American members. After World War II and during the beginning of the Cold War, White remained a staunch anti-Communist and stressed the need for racial justice in America to compete with the Soviets in winning third-world allies. Due in part to White's urging, Harry Truman ran on a civil rights platform in the 1948 presidential election. "
64577,"In 1789, after performing invaluable service to his country both during and after the Revolution, John Adams became George Washington's vice president and the first to discover how insignificant that office could be. The position, however, yielded one important compensation: it became the springboard for his election to the presidency in 1796.  Chief among Adams's presidential successes was the avoidance of hostilities over France's infringement on American neutrality in the war between France and Great Britain. Unfortunately, Adams pleased no one in doing so, and he left the White House in 1801 largely discredited on all sides. Recalling his administration years later, he noted, ""No man who ever held the office of president would ever congratulate a friend on obtaining it.""  This portrait was derived from sittings that occurred during Adams's vice presidency. By then, John Trumbull had painted two other likenesses of Adams, including one that was eventually incorporated into Trumbull's picture depicting the signing of the Declaration of Independence, which now resides in the U.S. Capitol rotunda.  "
64600,"Modernist poet Marianne Moore won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1952, the same year that Soss Melik drew this portrait. Moore's friends and fellow poets, including T. S. Eliot, Wallace Stevens, and Allen Ginsberg, admired the precision and intellectual rigor of her work. William Carlos Williams once commented on her technique of seeing vastness in everyday things, ""so that in looking at some apparently small object, one feels the swirl of great events.""  Moore was known for her trademark cloak and tricorn hat, but Melik suggests her independence through a proud tilt to her head and her old-fashioned crown of braided hair. Despite her reserved expression here, Moore was known to be playful and quirky. A passionate baseball fan, she once remarked that she would give much to have invented the intricate stitch pattern of baseballs.   "
64606,"The hypo    This picture of a fresh-faced and eager Lincoln was designed to advertise the appeal of the Republican candidate for the presidency in 1860. Lincoln always maintained a public image of sober good sense, leavened with his characteristic sense of humor. But he had been burdened from his early days with a sense of melancholia that he called ""the hypo,"" a slang term for morbid depression. Lincoln's friends noticed how he would have ""spells"" of dark hopelessness when he would retreat into himself, emerging only by dint of working hard and being sociable. Lincoln has been medically ""diagnosed"" more than any other president, but whether he was clinically depressed in the modern sense cannot be determined, despite the confidence of some scholars. The nineteenth-century term ""melancholia"" seems less anachronistic, not least because of Lincoln's sense of fatalism that life had to be endured. "
64607,"In an 1865 editorial, Horace Greeley, publisher of the New York Tribune, declared, ""Go west, young man, go west."" Although this statement was probably first uttered by an Indiana journalist in 1851, it succinctly summarized the passion for westward expansion shared by many in the East. Like other journalists of the day, including John O'Sullivan, who prophesied in 1845 that it was America's ""manifest destiny"" to settle the entire continent, Greeley advocated the exploration and settlement of the West. In 1859 he traveled west by railroad and stagecoach, documenting his journey in a series of articles, one of which called for the construction of a transcontinental railroad.   "
64628,"Louis XIV enjoyed the longest reign in European history (1643-1715). The Sun King's France was the epitome of Baroque royal absolutism, creating a model for contemporary and subsequent European rulers to emulate. French efforts to organize a colonial empire in North America culminated under Louis. Although a foundation had been built with the settlement of Acadia in 1605 and Quebec in 1608, it was not until 1665, when Jean Talon was sent to Quebec, that an effective royal government was established there, launching an era of heightened French explorations and missionary activities. In 1682, Robert, Sieur de La Salle, reached the mouth of the Mississippi and claimed ""Louisiana"" for France. New Orleans, the colony's capital, was founded in 1718. This engraving-based on a monumental painting by Parisian court painter Hyacinthe Rigaud-proclaims Louis's exalted status as absolute ruler of France."
64640,"One of James K. Polk's objectives when he became president of the United States in 1845 was to purchase California from Mexico. When his overture was rebuffed, Polk sent the American army to the Rio Grande. When Congress declared war on Mexico, General Zachary Taylor (1784-1850), a forty-year veteran, led the army to victory in Monterrey and Buena Vista. Talk of these triumphs soon led Taylor to be posited as a candidate for president. A supporter commissioned English émigré, William G. Brown to travel to Walnut Springs, near Monterrey, and paint Taylor in a military setting, so that those in eastern urban centers could identify him with his accomplishments. Taylor served as twelfth president of the United States from 1849 to 1850.    Uno de los objetivos de James K. Polk cuando llegó a presidente de los Estados Unidos en 1845 fue comprarle California a Méjico. Cuando se rechazó su propuesta, Polk envió el ejército norteamericano al Río Grande. Después de que el Congreso declarase la guerra contra México, el General Zachary Taylor (1784-1850), veterano militar de cuarenta años, comandó al ejército en sus victorias de Monterrey y Buena Vista. Las noticias de estos triunfos llevaron a que rápidamente Taylor fuera postulado como candidato a presidente. Uno de sus partidarios le encargó al emigrado inglés William G. Brown que viajara a Walnut Springs, cerca de Monterrey, y que pintara a Taylor dentro de un marco militar para que aquellos en los centros urbanos del este pudieran identificarlo con sus logros. Taylor sirvió desde 1849 hasta 1850 como el decimosegundo presidente de los Estados Unidos."
64842,"In 1954, when Ernest Hemingway received the Nobel Prize for Literature, the committee cited his ""mastery of the art of modern narration."" In fact, in his short stories and such novels as The Sun Also Rises (1926) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), Hemingway had in large measure invented a new literary style as he chronicled the disillusionment of a post-World War I ""lost generation."" His terse, powerful prose became a major influence on American literature. Hemingway's own experiences-reporting foreign wars, living the bohemian life in Paris, and adventuring in Africa, Spain, or Cuba-fueled his imagination and helped create his larger-than-life persona. Man Ray's 1928 photograph of a bandaged Hemingway, made after an accident with an overhead window, occasioned the quip from poet Ezra Pound: ""How the hellsufferin tomcats did you git drunk enough to fall upwards through the blithering skylight!"""
64877,"Whether Audrey Hepburn was playing a princess or a bookstore clerk, she was always the epitome of elegance and grace. While known as a trendsetter who projected an effortless poise on screen, she endured a difficult youth during World War II in Nazi-occupied Holland, two failed marriages, and periods of self-doubt. Despite these personal challenges, Hepburn publicly maintained a doe-eyed impishness that made her a leading box-office star. During a period when women were often cast as the male lead’s love interest, she insisted on being a central character. As Holly Golightly in Breakfast at Tiffany’s (1961)—with her large sunglasses, oversize cigarette holder, and little black Givenchy dress—she became an icon for a new generation of American women. As a film critic for the New York Times once enthused, ""What a burden she lifted from women! Here was proof that looking good need not be synonymous with looking bimbo."""
64943,"The career of St. Louis–born Thomas Stearns Eliot represents how unsympathetic America was to genuine philosophical and artistic conservatism. Eliot moved to England in 1914 because he thought England’s literary society was more developed and because it offered the kind of structure—including an established church—in which he could find a home. Yet even in England, he retained his sense of modern life as alienated and fragmented, and felt that he was doomed to search endlessly for redemption. In 1921 Eliot published The Waste Land, probably the greatest modern poem, which famously begins: “April is the cruelest month, breeding / Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing / Memory and desire, stirring / Dull roots with spring rain.” It closes with the paradox: “These fragments I have shored against my ruins.” This son of an industrialist was buried in Westminster Abbey’s Poets’ Corner."
64972,"Born Chilmark, Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts    This rare 1766 mezzotint engraving by Richard Jennys attests to Jonathan Mayhew's heroic status among his contemporaries. The son of Experience Mayhew, who served as a missionary to Native Americans, Jonathan Mayhew demonstrated at an early age his affinity for independent thinking. The Harvard-trained Congregational minister preached in support of individual liberty and the limitation of royal power, which, he argued, should be supported when just but resisted when tyrannical. These principles, and the role of the New England Congregationalist clergy in preparing the colonists for rebellion, would help shape the intellectual framework of the American Revolution. Shortly before his death in 1766, Mayhew delivered an important sermon entitled ""The Snare Broken,"" celebrating the repeal of the Stamp Act, which had taxed the colonists without their consent. John Adams later recognized the role of Mayhew's rhetoric in shaping revolutionary sentiment, praising his determination to resist ""tyranny . . . and at the same time to destroy . . . bigotry, fanaticism, and inconsistency."""
64988,"Born New Rochelle, New York  In the 1910s, a vogue for “social dancing” swept America. Riding the fad, dancers Irene and Vernon Castle became so popular that they helped transform contemporary moral behavior: their example made it acceptable for respectable people to dance in public. F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that the Castles “gave the modern dance a social position and brought the nice girl into the dance.”  The Castles sparked the new craze because they danced beautifully together; as Irene said, they were “young, clean, married and well-mannered.” Under their cheerful guidance, people learned to perform dances like the Castle Walk and the Foxtrot with an ease that made everyone feel brave enough to take the floor.  Fashionable and vibrant, Irene Castle symbolized the “New Woman” of the early twentieth century. She believed that dancing was emancipating—it allowed women to reinvent their lives to embrace “the joy of living.”"
65168,"By 1927, when Douglas Fairbanks appeared as an Argentine cowboy outlaw in The Gaucho, he was world-renowned for the gusto and breezy athleticism he brought to his films. ""There is, after all,"" one newspaper commented, ""no one quite like him in the picture world."" The Gaucho introduced new dramatic dimensions: an exotic South American setting, a bolas (a weighted, lariat-like weapon), and a spiritual angle inspired by Fairbanks's visit to the shrine of Our Lady of Lourdes. But the poster campaign marketed the forty-four-year-old actor as the swashbuckling adventurer audiences loved. His handsome, grinning face dominates the image, with the Andes and a bolas-wielding cowboy silhouetted below. The prominent cigarette is undoubtedly meant to imply the gaucho's raffish lawlessness before he encounters the healing miracles of a shrine. But given Fairbanks's popularity, it undoubtedly encouraged the growing glamour of smoking in public."
65227,"Accustomed to living abroad since childhood, master novelist Henry James was more comfortable in Europe than in the United States. James frequently pursued the theme of encounters between the Old World and the New in his fiction, and his books often explored the plight of Americans who lose their naïveté through adventures on the Continent. Although James ultimately claimed British citizenship, he never lost his sense of American identity. A close friend of American novelist Edith Wharton, James was visiting her in France when he agreed to sit for this portrait by Jacques-Émile Blanche. Pleased with the final product, which disguised his girth, James declared that ""it has a certain dignity of intention and indication-of who and what, poor creature, he 'is'! It ought to be seen in the U.S.""  "
65250,"Born Sandusky, Ohio     Charles Frohman moved to New York City as a teenager. With the help of his brothers, who were involved in the theater world, he began to serve as an advance agent for touring companies. His first success as an independent producer was the Civil War melodrama Shenandoah, which ran for 250 performances in 1889. Three years later, his construction of the Empire Theatre on Fortieth Street and Broadway prompted the move of New York’s theater district from Fourteenth Street to its present location. Frohman was instrumental in launching theater as an entertainment industry through his co-founding of the controversial Theatrical Syndicate, a monopoly that assigned actors to roles in Broadway shows that toured in select venues. By the time of his death, Frohman had produced more than six hundred plays.   This portrait by José María Mora, a major nineteenth-century stage photographer, is one of a few surviving photographs of Frohman, who, despite his public job, led a very private life."
65255,"Two giants of twentieth-century American architecture, Philip Johnson (left) and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe appear in Irving Penn's 1955 photograph with a model for the New York Seagram Building on which they collaborated. Raised in Germany, where he served as director of the Bauhaus from 1930 to 1933, Mies immigrated to the United States in 1937, escaping Nazi oppression. Characterizing architecture as ""the real battleground of the spirit,"" Mies had already impressed Philip Johnson, who had helped coin the term ""International Style"" to describe the work Mies exemplified. A museum curator, Johnson chronicled Mies's career with a 1947 exhibition and book. Johnson later suggested Mies for the Seagram commission. Embodying the simplicity and attention to detail typical of Mies's glass and steel constructions, the building, considered a masterpiece, epitomizes the ""Miesian style"" that would sweep the United States. "
65309,"Born Baltimore, Maryland    Thurgood Marshall played a major role in the 1940s and 1950s as a leader in the struggle to end racial discrimination in the United States. From 1938 to 1961, he served as chief staff lawyer for the NAACP. Marshall devoted much effort to tailoring arguments that led the Supreme Court to its unanimous 1954 Brown v. the Board of Education of the City of Topeka decision, which ruled segregation of public schools by race to be unconstitutional. But he realized the struggle was not over. At a party celebrating the Brown decision, Marshall warned his colleagues, ""I don't want any of you to fool yourselves, it's just begun; the fight has just begun."" He went on to become the first African American Supreme Court justice, nominated by President Lyndon Johnson in 1967."
65309,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
65435,"Until Eugene O'Neill began writing dramas in the early decades of the twentieth century, American plays had consisted largely of forgettable comedies and melodramas. O'Neill broke radically with that tradition and, through his probing into the human condition, became the first American dramatist to achieve recognition as a writer of lasting importance. The product of a troubled family, O'Neill lived a vagabond existence as young man before taking up writing in his mid-twenties. His first triumph came in 1920, when his play Beyond the Horizon earned the Pulitzer Prize. A string of compelling works followed in rapid succession, including Anna Christie and Strange Interlude (also Pulitzer Prize winners), Desire Under the Elms, and Ah Wilderness! O'Neill's most enduring achievements would prove to be the plays he crafted toward the end of his life, among them The Iceman Cometh and Long Day's Journey into Night."
65497,"Born Englewood, New Jersey  In 1977 John Travolta helped launch the disco craze with his Academy Award–winning performance in Saturday Night Fever. He played Tony Manero, a young Italian American whose fantasy life flourished at a local Brooklyn discotheque. The disco was his outlet for an otherwise dead-end life: when Tony put on his white suit and hit the floor, his dancing ruled the night.  Saturday Night Fever was the first film since Cabaret (1972) to showcase dance, and the soundtrack by the Bee Gees became one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time.   The dancing of the disco era fueled social dancing and club-going throughout the 1970s, perhaps most notably at New York’s Studio 54, which from 1977 to 1981 was frequented by such celebrities as Liza Minnelli, Andy Warhol, and Mikhail Baryshnikov."
65509,"Billy Dee Williams (born 1937) has worked in film and television for nearly fifty years. He is best known for his role opposite Diana Ross in Lady Sings the Blues (1972), which focused on the life of Billie Holiday, and his work in two of the Star Wars movies, The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Return of the Jedi (1983). Williams has also worked as an artist throughout his life, having studied at the High School of Music and Art in New York City and later at the National Academy of Art. He specializes in acrylic paintings combining traditional brushwork with an airbrushing technique. In 1993 he created Self-Portrait with Gardenia, which references a famous scene in Lady Sings the Blues when his character, Louis McKay, offers a gardenia to Billie Holiday."
65527,"The daughter of a Lakota mother and a white father, Gertrude Bonnin spent her early childhood on a reservation in South Dakota. As she pursued her education opportunities outside the reservation, she was increasingly troubled by pressures from the white world to disassociate herself from her ethnic heritage. In reaction, she turned to compiling an anthology of Native American lore, published in 1901 as Old Indian Legends. But the ultimate resolution of her identity crisis lay in her activism. By 1915, she was the leader in the drive to advance Native American interests, and in 1926 she founded the National Council of American Indians, which soon became a main force in the effort to make the government's policies toward Native Americans more just.   This image was made in 1898, while Bonnin was teaching at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, where assimilation to mainstream culture was a goal."
65537,"While Langston Hughes was austere and cerebral in his manner and verse, his contemporary Claude McKay was a more flamboyant character; he was also more political. Born in Jamaica, McKay won a college scholarship and immigrated to America, where he also began publishing poetry, frequently under a pseudonym. By 1921 he was editing two radical newspapers, doing other political work (including traveling to Moscow to meet Lenin), and publishing his first major collection of poems, Harlem Shadows (1921). McKay’s poetry was frequently overtly political, treating racism and outrages such as lynching with a plain sense of grievance and redress. His work helps mark the entry of African Americans into both the cultural and political history of American society. "
65568,"When Time magazine ran this cover image of Susan Faludi standing behind a seated Gloria Steinem in March 1992, it was an apt pairing. To begin with, both were feminists. While Steinem, founder of Ms. magazine, belonged to the older generation of women's activists, Faludi, a Pulitzer Prize-winning Wall Street Journal reporter, represented feminism's younger generation. They were also both authors of current best-sellers that offered two sides of the most recently minted feminist coin.  Faludi's book, Backlash, took as its thesis the view that in the 1980s forces had coalesced to hamper the progress in securing women's rights. Steinem's book, Revolution from Within, was more individually oriented, contending that enlarging life's possibilities hinged largely on self-understanding. Although many feminists felt betrayed by Steinem's message, she countered that ""when one member of a group changes, the balance shifts for everyone,"" which in turn ""shifts the balance of society."" "
65575,"One of the leading African American statesmen during Reconstruction, John Roy Lynch was born in slavery and later sold with his mother and siblings to a planter in Natchez, Mississippi. Liberated when Union forces reached Natchez in 1863, Lynch strove to educate himself, and soon developed a passion for politics and parliamentary law. Advocating Republican Party initiatives for the advancement of southern blacks, Lynch spoke eloquently in support of the new Mississippi constitution, which extended voting rights to black men. Elected to the state legislature in 1869, he served as speaker of the house during his second term. In 1873, at the age of twenty-six, Lynch became the first African American to represent Mississippi in the U.S. House of Representatives. A champion for human rights legislation, Lynch helped win passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1875, which he termed ""an act of simple justice."" "
65678,"Dubbed ""the King of Swing"" after a riotously successful concert at Hollywood's Palomar Ballroom in 1935, Benny Goodman took swing music into the cultural stratosphere with his band's distinctive, pulsating sound. In 1938 he brought jazz to Carnegie Hall in a legendary concert that showcased virtuoso performances of ""Sing, Sing, Sing,"" ""Stompin' at the Savoy,"" and ""Don't Be That Way."" Goodman was also in the forefront of desegregating jazz, bringing such musicians as vibraphonist Lionel Hampton and pianist Teddy Wilson into his orchestra at a time when mainstream jazz was defined by black and white barriers. In the 1950s and 1960s, he toured extensively, bringing the swing era sound to new generations. He received a Kennedy Center Honors award in 1982."
65751,"Born Manhattan, Kansas   Damon Runyon had a wonderful ear for dialect, and his short stories depicting Times Square in the 1920s and 1930s left an indelible mark on American culture between the wars. His Times Square denizens were a mix of hustlers, gamblers, gangsters, and chorus girl ""dolls."" They spent their nights in Broadway bolt-holes and communicated in a colorful slang that became known as ""Runyonesque."" His short stories were hugely popular, and twenty of them were made into films, including Little Miss Marker, which made Shirley Temple a star in 1934. Runyon’s biggest success came posthumously, with Frank Loesser’s 1950 musical, Guys and Dolls; Loesser drew on two of his stories and showcased such quintessential Runyon characters as Nathan Detroit, Sky Masterson, Nicely Nicely, and Miss Adelaide. The show ran for 1,200 performances and won the Tony Award for Best Musical."
65756,"Born Staten Island, New York    Known as “the queen of the folk singers” during the heyday of hootenannies—folk music’s version of a jam session—Joan Baez had what a 1962 Time magazine cover story called a voice “as clear as air in the autumn, a vibrant, strong, untrained and thrilling soprano.” She played the coffeehouse circuit before causing a sensation at the 1959 Newport Folk Festival, and she soon became associated with such legendary folk groups as the Weavers and the Seeger family. Her first album of English and American ballads was a huge success and included her soon-to-be classic renditions of “Barbara Allen” and “All My Trials.” By the mid-1960s Baez was associated with various political causes, most prominently the antiwar and civil rights movements."
65789,"Born Tioga, Texas  Within a few years of his 1934 film debut, cowboy crooner Gene Autry was a box-office favorite whose popularity rivaled that of stars like Clark Gable and Mickey Rooney. Autry got his start on the radio in 1927 as ""Oklahoma’s Yodeling Cowboy"" and later gained an enthusiastic following as the ""Nation’s Number One Singing Cowboy"" on radio’s National Barn Dance program. Brought to Hollywood for a cameo role in 1934, Autry was given the lead in the weekly serial The Phantom Empire (1935) and went on to star in dozens of low-budget westerns for Republic Studios. He profited handsomely from the sale of Gene Autry–themed merchandise—from guitars to cap pistols—and also enjoyed a lucrative recording career, with hits that included ""Tumbling Tumbleweeds"" (1935) and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" (1949). In the 1950s Autry made the move to television, forming a production company and starring in his own series."
65992,"Although not an accredited architect, Buckminster Fuller was best known for his many experiments in building design. Ever faithful to his ""dymaxion"" principle, which called for maximum results from a minimum of material and energy, he was an early advocate of prefabrication, and by the late 1920s he was exploring the feasibility of such things as the modular bathroom. The most famous of Fuller's achievements was the geodesic dome, an example of which can be seen in this photograph. Patented in 1947, this spherical structure required no internal support, thus creating an unobstructed interior space. In 1967, one of these domes served as the United States pavilion at the world exposition in Montreal, where it became a symbol of America's rich tradition in technical innovation. "
66114,"General Mark Clark acquired his first distinction of World War II by leading a reconnaissance mission to Morocco in preparation for the Allied invasion of North Africa in late 1942. As Fifth Army commander and then as head of all Allied forces in Italy, he went on to play a central role in finally overcoming the stiff German resistance there; in May 1945 he had the satisfaction of accepting the surrender of German forces in Italy. Clark never let rank keep him from the front lines, and his frequent ventures into combat zones earned him the deep affection of many an enlisted man.  At one point, Clark lost his temper with Pietro Annigoni's progress on this picture and stormed out of the studio, leaving his army jacket. Although Annigoni ultimately delivered the portrait, he kept Clark's jacket for use as a painting coat.  "
66139,"In 1919, labor organizer and Socialist Party of America founder Eugene V. Debs was imprisoned for statements deemed critical of the war effort by Woodrow Wilson's attorney general. After his conviction, Debs voiced his solidarity with those he had always championed: ""While there is a lower class, I am in it, while there is a criminal element, I am of it, and where there is a soul in prison, I am not free."" Debs never retreated from his goal to transform American capitalism, taking the socialist cause to its high-water mark in the 1912 presidential election, where he received nearly one million votes.  "
66146,"Perhaps no figure in American letters has ever identified himself more readily and affectionately with grassroots America than Carl Sandburg. From his poem ""Chicago,"" hailing that city as ""Hog Butcher to the World,"" to his efforts to preserve American folk music and his six-volume biography of Abraham Lincoln, Sandburg seemed forever dedicated to enriching popular appreciation for his country's democratic experience. In the 1930s, as the Depression steadily eroded the optimism that had always been an underpinning of that experience, he concluded that what the public most needed from him now was a reminder of the country's resilient virtues. By 1936, he had completed The People, Yes, a long discourse in free verse admitting to America's failings but, more important, celebrating its overriding strengths. ""A foreigner will find more of America"" in it, one critic wrote, ""than in any other book."""
66154,"When Time ran a cover story about civil rights on June 21, 1963, the Kennedy brothers made the cover, although Bobby was given prominence. In the background are profiles of Bobby and Jack huddling together, deep in discussion. For two years, with the nation in the midst of a nuclear arms race with the Soviets and racial violence flaring up throughout the South, the president and his attorney general had plenty to discuss. Their immediate concerns focused on how to respond to the demands of blacks, who charged that the administration was not doing enough to break down barriers of segregation and open the doors of equal opportunity in all walks of life, particularly in government and education. As the attorney general, Bobby Kennedy had the primary job to enforce existing laws, which for too long had been ignored and circumvented.   Robert F. Kennedy  1925–1968     El 21 de junio de 1963 Time publicó un artículo sobre los derechos civiles y colocó en la portada a los hermanos Kennedy, aunque fue Bobby quien recibió más prominencia. Al fondo se ven los perfiles de Bobby y Jack muy cerca uno del otro, sumidos en una conversación. A lo largo de dos años, en medio de una carrera contra los soviéticos por las armas nucleares y estallidos de violencia racial en el sur, el presidente y su procurador general tuvieron mucho que conversar. Su preocupación inmediata era reaccionar a las demandas de la comunidad negra, que acusaba a la administración de no hacer lo suficiente por derribar las barreras de la segregación y abrir las puertas de la igualdad de oportunidades en todos los ámbitos, sobre todo en el gobierno y la educación. La encomienda principal de Bobby Kennedy como procurador general era hacer cumplir las leyes existentes, largamente ignoradas y evadidas.

66164,"There is no business quite as uncertain as the news business, and everyone at Time magazine, from publisher to cub reporter, experienced this almost weekly. And breaking news could be frenetic, as was the case in November 1958, when the cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church, convening at the Vatican, announced their selection of a new pontiff, Pope John XXIII. As Time reported, this news affected much of the magazine’s staff, especially Chaliapin, who ""set something of a speed record with his portrait of John XXIII."" With the reputation as the magazine’s quickest cover artist, Chaliapin regularly cranked out portraits in two days, but this one was finished in less than twenty-four hours. "
66246,"Twenty-second and twenty-fourth president, 1885–89 and 1893–97      Grover Cleveland has the distinction of being the only president to serve two nonconsecutive terms. He was also the first Democratic president since James Buchanan, breaking the Republican Party’s hold on the office. Cleveland’s appeal derived from his experience as governor of his home state, New York. There, he pursued a vigorous policy of reform to make government more efficient and lessen the effects of partisanship, a program he continued in the White House. Cleveland narrowly lost reelection to Benjamin Harrison but regained the presidency in 1892. His second term was not a success as the nation struggled with the impact of the Panic of 1893, one of the country’s most severe economic downturns.    The painter of this portrait, Swedish artist Anders Zorn, drew his loose brushwork and preference for natural lighting from French impressionism. Cleveland was quite pleased with Zorn’s likeness, declaring to a correspondent, “As for my ugly mug, I think the artist has “’struck it off’ in great shape.”"
66260,"Born Hartford, Connecticut     In the early twentieth century, when business leaders became the focus of national attention, J. Pierpont Morgan was the most powerful and influential of those American financiers. His banking empire had controlling or major interests in key railroads and industries, including U.S. Steel and General Electric. A directive from Morgan could influence the stock market, which happened in the Panic of 1907, when he lent his prestige and collateral to help stabilize Wall Street. His gift was for consolidating businesses to make them more efficient and profitable. But Morgan also got along with “trust buster” president Theodore Roosevelt, who sought to regulate concentrations of wealth and power rather than break them up.  Morgan rejected this photograph of him—which was later published to great acclaim—undoubtedly because of its fierce expression and the knife-shaped reflection on the arm of the chair."
66293,"Tenskwatawa, the most important Indian religious leader of this era, preached a return to traditional ways. Possessed with great oratorical skills, he built a large movement, and in 1808 he established Prophet’s Town in the Indiana Territory. He bitterly opposed territorial governor William Henry Harrison’s Treaty of Fort Wayne (1809), a dubious agreement in which some Indian chiefs ceded three million acres to the government. Tenskwatawa denied that these chiefs had a legitimate claim to the lands and warned Harrison not to allow white settlement on them. Harrison surrounded Prophet’s Town, demanding the Indians disperse and hand over those guilty of frontier raids. Tenskwatawa attacked on November 7, 1811, promising his warriors that his powers would protect them. Each side in what became known as the Battle of Tippecanoe suffered heavy casualties, but the Indians left the field. Harrison burned out Prophet’s Town, claiming victory; Tenskwatawa was discredited and no longer led Indians into battle."
66310,"Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry's greatest achievement in his long naval career was the establishment of diplomatic contact between Japan and the United States. In 1852, President Millard Fillmore sent Perry to Japan, which had been closed to foreign contact for more than two centuries. Bearing gifts representing American industrial and technological achievements, Perry negotiated the Treaty of Kanagawa (1854), which permitted U.S. access to two ports and  established a consulate in Shimoda. This portrait, included in the book Ikobu Ochiba Kugo (""a basket for fallen leaves from abroad""), shows Perry with the prominent nose that the Japanese associated with Americans.  "
66320,"On September 7, 1853, Henry Meade married Sarah A. Meserole, whose Huguenot ancestors had been among the first to settle in what came to be known as the Greenpoint and Williamsburgh communities on Long Island. The couple expressed the hope that their wedding would be a ""Brilliant Affair"" and chose New York City’s prestigious Trinity Church for the nuptials. They must have been gratified when Charles Meade later reported that ""the minister said they never had as many people in Trinity Church before."""
66327,"Born Dutchess County, New York   In February 1937 President Franklin Roosevelt proposed legislation that would increase the number of federal judges, including those on the Supreme Court, which had struck down many of his New Deal programs. The bill would allow the president to add judges for each incumbent who was seventy or older, which would give him up to six nominations for the Supreme Court. To the left stands Homer Cummings, Roosevelt’s attorney general. Senator Burton K. Wheeler, a Democrat from Montana, led the opposition, using as his weapon a letter by Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes (represented here by the bowling ball) that expressed opposition to Roosevelt’s plan. Although Congress utterly rejected Roosevelt’s ""court-packing"" strategy, within a year the Court began judging his legislation more favorably, and a vacancy on there allowed him to appoint a new justice."
66336,"War is war and not popularity-seeking. With these words to his Confederate opponent at Atlanta, General William T. Sherman suggested the attitude that made him both a successful commander and a bitterly hated figure in the South. He stripped war of glory and chivalry. His destructive march through Georgia and his later campaign in the Carolinas dismantled the economic base of the Confederacy and shattered the morale of its citizens. His methods anticipated twentieth-century ""total war.""  Influenced perhaps by Sherman's reputation for severe tactics in the field, artist G. P. A. Healy once noted that he found the Union general a forbidding portrait subject at first. But as the posing progressed, he found the general quite friendly."
66370,"Born Los Angeles, California    The 1953 film Niagara helped the young Marilyn Monroe become a legendary sex symbol who is still deeply embedded in the American psyche. In Niagara, Monroe plays an adulterous wife scheming to murder her depressed war-veteran husband. Monroe dominated the film, projecting into her character a sympathetic complexity, provocative sexuality, and naive vulnerability as she underestimates her violent spouse. With its lurid text and romance-novel illustration, however, the poster promotes her sex appeal alone, undermining her talent and setting the marketing strategy that would define her career. Although Monroe consistently transcended the dumb blonde stereotypes she played in such films as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and The Seven Year Itch, she chafed against the restrictions on her roles. The traumas of multiple marriages and emotional stress ultimately ended in her death by a drug overdose in 1962, but her tragic history and luminous physicality left an enduring mark. "
66377,"Born Jackson, Mississippi    Writer Eudora Welty devoted the bulk of her novels and short stories to portraying her native South. The originality of her work led critics to rank her with such literary giants of the twentieth century as William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. Some feel that only southerners can fully appreciate Welty's command of local idiom and her painstaking attention to time and place. According to one admirer, however, Welty demonstrated ""that the deeper one goes into the heart of a region, the more one transcends its . . . boundaries."" Among Welty's best-known works is The Optimist's Daughter, for which she received a Pulitzer Prize in 1973. Welty and the artist who painted her portrait, Mildred Wolfe-both residents of Jackson, Mississippi-knew each other for many years. The writer posed for the likeness seated in her favorite chair in her own living room. "
66480,"Depending upon one's sympathies, John Singleton Mosby was either a guerrilla or a cavalry hero. This native Virginian was by profession a lawyer, but when the Civil War began, he joined the Confederate cavalry in time to fight at the First Battle of Manassas in July 1861. Placed under the command of General J. E. B. Stuart, Mosby fought with distinction in the Peninsular Campaign and at Antietam. In 1863 he was authorized to organize a group of rangers who operated behind enemy lines, struck without warning, and then dispersed to meet later at a prearranged spot.  "
66543,"Born Oak Park, Illinois  Like Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey pioneered a style of dance that reflected modern life in America. She began studying at Denishawn in 1917 and became a principal dancer and choreographer before launching an independent career in 1928. Partnering with dancer-choreographer Charles Weidman, she focused both on choreography and on movements that explored the body’s response to gravity. Humphrey became known especially for her emphasis on breathing rhythms and a technique of “fall and recovery” that incorporated balance, breath, weight, and spatial orientation.   She retired from performing in 1944 and became artistic director for the José Limón Dance Company after World War II; her most notable work was Day on Earth (1947). In 1951 Humphrey became director of the Juilliard Dance Theatre, where she served as a tireless mentor and initiated efforts to document the evanescent art of dance through “Labanotation,” a system that captures dance movements on the page so they can be shared. "
66568,"Third president, 1801–9    Thomas Jefferson’s tombstone notes, by his own instruction, that he authored the Declaration of Independence, founded the University of Virginia, and was responsible for Virginia’s Statute for Religious Freedom. But it fails to mention that this philosopher, inventor, and scientist was also president of the United States. This does not mean that his administration lacked significance. During Jefferson’s presidency, the nation acquired from France the vast wilderness known as the Louisiana Purchase, successfully stood its ground against extortion attempts from Barbary Coast pirates in the Mediterranean, and reduced the debt 40 percent. These early successes, however, paled in comparison to the wrath later heaped on Jefferson in the wake of the economically disastrous trade embargo he imposed in response to British and French interference with U.S. shipping. A much-beleaguered Jefferson ended his presidency by calling it a best-forgotten “splendid misery.”  Gilbert Stuart was not only early America’s most admired portraitist but also an eccentric known for procrastinating. After sitting for this portrait in 1805, Jefferson had to wait sixteen years before it was finally delivered. "
66606,"Charlotte Cushman was an actor in the same vein as Edwin Forrest, exemplifying the vigor, passion, and emotional fervor that were prized both by the Romantics and by Americans eager to assert their cultural distinctiveness from Europe. Cushman's formal training in London enhanced the emotional directness of her performances. She debuted as Lady Macbeth in 1836 and thereafter went from strength to strength in a range of widely praised performances. Because of Cushman's commanding, supposedly masculine appearance, she also took on male roles such as Romeo and Hamlet, winning praise for these performances as well. The Romantic English poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning commented that this portrait by William Page ""is really wonderful-soul and body together.""  "
66629,"Born Paris, France    Known primarily for her sculptural work, the French-born artist Louise Bourgeois only achieved widespread recognition in the mid-1970s, when she was well into her sixties. Wryly noting that her recognition ""could have come earlier, but that it's better than nothing at all,"" Bourgeois came to prominence in large part through the increased attention to female artists that resulted from the women's movement. But her stature has less to do with her gender than with her work's powerful exploration of themes of deep human significance, often reflecting the struggle of wills that characterize human relationships. Describing her approach to sculpting in a 1988 interview, Bourgeois noted: ""I do not want to use the stone for my own purposes. I want to bring out its highest potential. And I do this with my tools-a hammer, a chisel, a drill. But always there is resistance. The urge to please someone, to want someone is very strong. Seduction is never finished.""  "
66633,"Born Utica, New York    An avid reformer and philanthropist who used his own considerable fortune to support charitable causes, Gerrit Smith became one of the nation's leading abolitionists after joining the antislavery movement in 1835. Smith was a friend to radical abolitionist John Brown, who brought his family to live in a settlement that Smith had founded in the Adirondacks as a refuge for free blacks and fugitive slaves. In 1859 Smith secretly helped to finance Brown's raid on the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, but in the aftermath of the raid's failure, he denied knowledge of Brown's plans and briefly suffered a mental breakdown."
66672,"In the mid-1950s, Edward R. Murrow was the dean of broadcast journalism-a genre he had pioneered. Hired as director of news by CBS in 1935, Murrow broadcast the outbreak of war in Europe; from 1938 to 1945, his signature opening, ""This . . . is London,"" brought the war into American living rooms. In the postwar's new medium, television, Murrow launched See It Now (1951-58), a news documentary program that he called ""an entirely new weapon of journalism."" Its high point was a March 1954 broadcast that helped topple Senator Joseph McCarthy. Murrow also hosted the popular Person to Person, in which he visited celebrities in their homes during prime time (1952-61). Murrow left CBS in 1961 and directed the United States Information Agency until his death in 1965."
66686,"Seven Ages of Man  The Meade Brothers exhibited numerous examples of their work at the ""Great Exhibition"" held in New York City’s Crystal Palace (1853–54), including a series of daguerreotypes by Charles Meade illustrating Shakespeare’s ""seven ages,"" as described in Act II of As You Like It. Lauded by the Photographic Art Journal for reflecting ""much talent"" and ""a high degree of cultivated taste,"" the Meade Brothers’ Seven Ages of Man—Infant, Schoolboy, Lover, Soldier, Justice, Pantaloon, and Second Childishness—later circulated in the form of card-mounted photographs known as cartes de visite."
66694,"Renowned for making songs her own, Billie Holiday once explained, ""I hate straight singing. I have to change a tune to my own way of doing it. That's all I know."" This attitude characterized not only her singing style but her life as well. Having endured a difficult childhood, Holiday moved to New York City in 1927.  Intent on fashioning a musical career, she began performing to supplement her meager income as a housemaid. Success onstage led to recording opportunities and, beginning in 1937, a close working relationship with Count Basie's band. Holiday later joined the Artie Shaw Orchestra, becoming one of the first African American singers to headline an all-white band. Despite the stardom she achieved, Holiday suffered various personal crises during the last two decades of her life, several of which were the result of drug and alcohol abuse."
66745,"Over the course of her career, singer Jessye Norman carefully husbanded her talents, and she turned down many of the choicest roles in opera in the interest of preserving her voice. Choosiness did not hamper the growth of her reputation. From the moment in 1969 when she made her opera debut at Berlin's German Opera in Tannhäuser, the virtues of her rich, sumptuous voice were never in doubt, and her early years, spent performing largely in Europe, were marked by a succession of triumphs. Of one of her concert performances in 1974, one critic wrote that she had given ""as nearly flawless a performance as one could rightly expect from the human voice.""  This image of Norman was made for Vanity Fair at the time of her first appearance at the Metropolitan Opera in the fall of 1983. "
66933,"When Diana Vreeland went to work at Harper's Bazaar in the mid-1930s to help offset a decline in her husband's income, she found the perfect match for her background. Having always lived in a world of privilege, she had absorbed well the ground rules for determining what was chic. As Bazaar's fashion editor, and later as Vogue's editor-in-chief, she ultimately numbered among the most influential arbiters in American women's fashion. It was said that designers ""tremble[d] at her nod,"" and with good reason, since so many of their customers looked to her judgment in deciding what they would buy.  When Vreeland posed for this portrait in 1974, she had retired from Vogue and was serving as a consultant for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute, where she curated a number of remarkably engaging exhibitions on fashion."
67029,"During the economic depression known as the panic of 1837, August Belmont-in the United States as an enterprising employee of Germany's Rothschild Bank-scouted the opportunities, resigned from his job, and shortly amassed a fortune, founding the firm of August Belmont and Company. Becoming an American citizen, Belmont turned to politics, and his support for the Democrats was rewarded with ambassadorships to Austria and the Netherlands. A staunch Unionist, Belmont used his European connections to argue the North's cause in both England and on the Continent. He was a patron of the arts and an avid sportsman, and his style of conspicuous consumption anticipated a later generation of American tycoons. Belmont further enhanced his public profile when he married the glamorous daughter of naval hero Matthew Perry in 1849."
67030,"This drawing by Don Bachardy is one of a group of portraits depicting his companion, the British-American writer Christopher Isherwood. Documenting their thirty-three-year relationship, the series is a testament to the collaborative nature of portraiture and creativity. Isherwood had become an American citizen in 1946, the year his prewar novels were reissued as The Berlin Stories. His fame increased when his stories became a play about cabaret singer Sally Bowles (better known through the musical version, Cabaret). Isherwood met Bachardy in 1953. The forty-eight-year-old author, who famously described himself as ""a camera with its shutter open,"" confirmed the eighteen-year-old Bachardy's own instinctive urge to record, and provided the younger man with financial and emotional support. Bachardy's carefully observed portraits of Isherwood are infused with a rich emotional warmth that speaks to the closeness of the relationship.  "
67076,"Brought up in what he described as stifling, repressive circumstances, the young Hugh Hefner made his life’s work the overthrow of puritanism and prudery in American life. Scraping money together to purchase nude photographs of Marilyn Monroe, Hefner launched Playboy in 1953. His timing was impeccable. The magazine, despite never becoming completely respectable, took off because it hit the sweet spot between America’s postwar consumerism and an increasing public appetite for the frank depiction of female sexuality. For young men, Playboy became a reliable guide to the best stereo, liquor—or woman.  Hefner’s trademark was his pipe, signifying suave sophistication, and the artist Marisol emphasizes it by having Hefner both smoking and holding one in this oversized wood sculpture. It is an awkward image, sharing nothing of the glossy airbrushed world of Playboy. In a cardigan, Hefner looks more like a stereotypical 1950s dad than a swinger."
67104,"The Harlem Renaissance of the early twentieth century was a misnomer. Harlem had always been the capital of African America, with its own cultural and social traditions. What ""Renaissance"" actually connoted was whites’ discovery of African America and their grudging admission to allow the most talented blacks to cross the color line and gain a measure of acceptance, if not full social and political equality. Among poets, Langston Hughes was a trailblazer, not only for black writers but also for his ability to force his way into mainstream American literature. Although white intellectuals projected their racial fantasies and preconceptions onto African Americans, seeing them as a way of revitalizing a sterile culture by injecting a dose of the ""primitive,"" Hughes focused on a deep commitment to African American history, treating the subject with the framework of modernist poetry. As would be the case throughout the century, a marginal or excluded group would reinvigorate the culture because their doubleness—the sense of being ""in"" but not completely ""of"" American society—worked to their advantage as artists. Paradoxically, the story of twentieth-century culture was sometimes best told through the eyes of those whom the culture most disdained: women, gays and lesbians, and African Americans."
67114,"Berenice Abbott's photograph captures the sexually provocative appeal of Djuna Barnes, one of the leaders of 1920s modernism, both as a writer and personality. Brought up in a sexually extravagant and dysfunctional household (her father was a polygamist), Barnes had a tempestuous life. Her passage through postwar Europe and America was representative of the era's sexual and artistic experimentation. In her first book of poems, The Book of Repulsive Women (1915), Barnes's description of lesbian sex was so explicit that she escaped prosecution for obscenity largely because straight society could not comprehend her audacity. Some critics compared her innovation in language in the experimental novel Nightwood (1936) with the work of Gertrude Stein. Barnes's experience presents an interesting study in how marginalization leads to artistic and linguistic innovation that expresses one's distance from the society that one observes. "
67131,"At the start of the Civil War, West Point graduate Ambrose Burnside was given command of the First Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry, which he led in the First Battle of Bull Run. He became a favorite of President Abraham Lincoln's, was given charge of an expedition against Confederates along the North Carolina coast, and rose to the position of major general of volunteers upon that expedition's success. In November 1862, over his own protests, Burnside was made commander of the Army of the Potomac. Shortly after his crushing defeat at Fredericksburg, the following month he was replaced by General Joseph Hooker. Later, in command of the Department of the Ohio, he ably defended Knoxville, and in 1863, under Ulysses S. Grant, he helped defeat Braxton Bragg at Chattanooga. But Burnside's poor performance at Petersburg in 1864 ultimately brought about his resignation from the service.   "
67162,"Renowned Seneca chief Sagoyewatha, who fought along with other Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) for the British during the American Revolution, received the name “Red Jacket” from the scarlet coats he habitually wore. In his dealings with the new American republic, he excelled as an orator and negotiator, always resisting any encroachment upon ancestral lands or Native customs and beliefs. In March 1792, Sagoyewatha led a delegation of Haudenosaunee to meet with George Washington in Philadelphia. Sagoyewatha supported the Americans during the War of 1812, but after participating in several battles, he proposed that Native Americans fighting on both sides withdraw from the war.   Especially proud of the large peace medal that President Washington presented to him, Sagoyewatha was rarely seen without it, and it appears in the image that Charles Bird King painted in Washington in 1828.    El célebre jefe Sagoyewatha, de la tribu seneca, luchó al lado de otros haudenosaunees (iroquois) a favor de los ingleses durante la Guerra de Independencia de Estados Unidos, y su apelativo de “Red Jacket” se debe a que solía vestirse con una casaca roja. Más tarde, en sus gestiones con la nueva república norteamericana, se distinguió como orador y negociador, siempre oponiendo resistencia ante la intrusión en sus tierras ancestrales, sus costumbres y sus creencias indígenas. En marzo de 1792, Sagoyewatha encabezó una delegación de haudenosaunees que se reunió con George Washington en Filadelfia. Sagoyewatha apoyó a los norteamericanos en la guerra de 1812, pero después de varias batallas propuso retirarse del conflicto a todos los indígenas que peleaban en ambos bandos.   Sagoyewatha estaba profundamente orgulloso de la medalla de la paz que le había regalado el presidente Washington, una pieza de gran tamaño, y casi nunca se le veía sin ella. Aquí aparece en la imagen que pintó Charles Bird King en Washington en 1828.

67236,"Fannie Lou Hamer, the twentieth child born to a family of sharecroppers in Mississippi, knew well the impoverished conditions of blacks in the South and her strong desire to improve those conditions fueled her activism. Hamer's emotional and memorable testimony before the credentials committee of the 1964 Democratic National Convention helped bring the atrocities inflicted upon blacks seeking the right to vote and the conditions of everyday people in her home state of Mississippi to a national television audience. Eventually, Hamer grew ""sick and tired of being sick and tired"" of the deprivation in the South and launched the Freedom Farm Cooperative in 1969 to provide housing and food for those in need. This photograph, taken by photojournalist Bruce Davidson, places Hamer amid six sharecropper children in the familiar surroundings of those she fought to help.  "
67262,"In the African American cultural movement of the 1920s known as the Harlem Renaissance, no one played a larger role than Alain Locke. A leading member of the Howard University faculty throughout most of his career, Locke believed that black artists and writers must look to their own heritage for their inspiration and material. In The New Negro, his anthology of essays, fiction, poetry, and art published in 1925, he conveyed that message with a persuasiveness that made the book a shaping influence of the renaissance and, at the same time, convinced many white critics that African American culture was worthy of more serious consideration. In the mid-1930s Locke became involved in producing the ""Bronze Booklets,"" a series that for many years was a basic tool in the teaching of African American history. "
67384,"An innovative painter, designer, and printmaker, James McNeill Whistler frequently identified his landscapes and portraits as ""symphonies,"" ""nocturnes,"" and ""arrangements,"" demonstrating his interest in atmosphere, color, and line. Though often neglected in his native United States, Whistler was lionized by the avant-garde of Europe, and his most productive years were spent in London and Paris. The artist's wit and self-fashioning further heightened his celebrity.  Joseph Edgar Boehm sculpted this bust in 1872, the year in which Whistler exhibited his now-famous Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Royal Academy in London.  "
67387,"By 1967, when Elaine made this dramatic likeness, Harold Rosenberg’s reputation was secure. His major collections of critical essays, The Tradition of the New (1959) and The Anxious Object (1964), had been published, and he served as art critic for the New Yorker. Elaine had painted and drawn Rosenberg many times over the years. This unusual and bold ink drawing focuses on his deep-set eyes, prominent eyebrows, and full, dark mustache. The gestural brushwork, seemingly uncontrolled, creates mass and form from dark pools and strokes of ink.  Para 1967, cuando Elaine realizó este dramático retrato, ya Harold Rosenberg gozaba de una reputación establecida. Había publicado sus principales colecciones de ensayos, The Tradition of the New (1959) y The Anxious Object (1964), y se desempeñaba como crítico de arte para la revista New Yorker. Elaine había pintado y dibujado a Rosenberg muchas veces a lo largo de los años. Este raro y audaz dibujo a tinta resalta sus ojos profundos, cejas prominentes y bigote espeso y oscuro. La ejecución gestual, en apariencia descontrolada, crea masa y forma mediante manchas oscuras y trazos de tinta. "
67416,"Amos Doolittle's ambitious engraving of George Washington grapples with the unprecedented challenge of inventing presidential iconography. The ratification of the Constitution signaled a dramatic change from a loose confederation of colonies to a nation with a strong federal government, and the central focus of that change-and of the print-was the new president. Doolittle surrounded the portrait with a heraldic ring of state seals, each inscribed with population statistics and congressional representation. These interlocking circles served as a symbol of the indissoluble unity to which the states had pledged themselves.  An engraving of this size and complexity was a remarkable achievement for the time. First issued in 1789, the print was updated several times as Doolittle changed the portrait, added territories, and corrected population statistics.  "
67417,"Born Smiljan, Croatia     The brilliant inventor Nikola Tesla captivated New York City’s celebrity press with such feats as introducing alternating-current electricity, lighting the 1893 Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition, and harnessing and generating power from Niagara Falls. His largest project (and biggest failure) was the attempted invention of wireless broadcasting, which was financed in large part by J. Pierpont Morgan. At one point, Tesla was touted as being “greater even than Edison.” A showman whose electrical demonstrations dazzled both scientific and popular audiences, Tesla was a dandified member of society who became wealthy off of profits from his patents, making many enemies along the way. Marius de Zayas’s unsettling, shadowy charcoal depicts Tesla in a coat and hat, as if he were striding purposefully along a dark street. But the impassioned intensity of his stride and his angular, proud profile hint at both his brilliance and an eccentric, unbalanced streak that was already apparent in Tesla’s character. "
67425,"Pictured at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, which he opened in 1963, Jonas Salk built his career on developing vaccines for influenza and polio. In the early 1940s, Salk and Thomas Francis Jr. revolutionized immunology with their killed-virus vaccine for influenza, which produced the protective antibodies without exposing recipients to the live virus of the disease itself. In 1947 Salk turned to producing a vaccine for polio, a viral infection capable of crippling or killing, especially young children. With the support from what is now the March of Dimes, Salk initiated experiments with killed-virus vaccines, reporting successful results in 1953. By 1955 the efficacy of the vaccine was clear, and it radically diminished the impact of polio in less than a decade. Unwilling to claim a patent, Salk asked rhetorically, ""Could you patent the sun?""  "
67430,"A leading voice of the so-called Lost Generation—a group of writers disillusioned with American life and materialism who sought refuge in Europe after World War I—Ernest Hemingway cultivated a rebellious public persona that matched his dark prose. In novels such as A Farewell to Arms (1929) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), Hemingway explored the psychological impact of violence and death during wartime. He wrote in a terse, clipped style that featured stripped-down dialogue and characters unanchored from society. While he portrayed man as essentially alone, he admired ""grace under pressure,"" a phrase often considered synonymous with cool.  This photograph features the author and sportsman on a pheasant shoot in Idaho. It was taken by Robert Capa, a Hungarian-born photographer whom Hemingway had befriended during his time as a reporter covering the Spanish Civil War."
67464,"Born Steubenville, Ohio  With the Civil War costing the federal government a million dollars a day, Edwin M. Stanton proved ideal for the vital cabinet post of secretary of war. In January 1862, he replaced the inefficient and politically motivated Simon Cameron, who left the department mired in waste and scandal. Stanton immediately brought about an effective reorganization, establishing strict procedures for negotiating war contracts and vigorously investigating fraudulent ones. Although many officials in Washington found Stanton irascible and arrogant, he maintained good relations with generals in the field, and Lincoln grew to rely upon his precision and vigor in administering the war effort. "
67489,"Born Point Pleasant, Ohio     In 1868, General Ulysses S. Grant was the nation’s foremost choice for the presidency. Yet his sole political ambition, he claimed, was “to be mayor of Galena [Illinois]—to build a new sidewalk from my home to the depot.” Grant served two terms as president, leaving a record of fraud and scandal. Although personally honest, he was at times badly served by scheming cronies who discredited his administration. When he left the White House, he said he felt like a boy let out of school, and he and his wife, Julia, embarked on a world tour lasting two years. Upon their return they established a home in New York City. In the fall of 1884, Grant was diagnosed with inoperable throat cancer. He had already begun writing his memoirs, an activity he enjoyed, but it become a race with death. He finished just days before he died, leaving his wife with the prospects of royalties amounting to $200,000."
67542,"Largely because of the charisma and political skills of his successor, Theodore Roosevelt, William McKinley seems to be a more distant and less modern president. However, McKinley’s war against Spain in 1898, led Spain to relinquish its colonies of the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam to the United States, extending America’s influence in the Pacific. This was a major step in the U.S. rise to be a world power in the twentieth century."
67569,"Illustrated news publications  At the start of the Civil War, the major illustrated news publications—Harper’s Weekly, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper, and the New York Illustrated News—were all northern enterprises engaged in telling their side of the war. The South had no comparable news organ until September 1862, when E. W. Ayres and W. H. Wade of Richmond began publishing the Southern Illustrated News. Because paper, ink, and printing presses were just a few of the South’s many scarcities, editors scrambled to produce weekly editions of the paper. Foremost was the challenge of finding good engravers to carve the illustrations into blocks of wood, which were then inked and printed on paper. The news pages on display here represent the papers of Ayres and Wade, and Frank Leslie.  President Abraham Lincoln and Union generals in Frank Leslie’s Portrait Pictorial, c. 1862"
67588,"Born Augusta County, Virginia     George Caleb Bingham moved with his family to the Missouri frontier in 1819. The young Bingham soon earned his living as a portraitist, augmenting his studies in Philadelphia in the late 1830s. By the early 1850s his anecdotal scenes depicting life along the sparsely settled Mississippi River, such as The Jolly Flatboatmen, were regarded as pictorial embodiments of the romance of the American wilderness. Bingham painted this self-portrait on a quarter-plate sheet of copper, which was intended as a support for a daguerreotype. He probably made it as a private memento for one of his kinsmen, for it belonged to family members for many years."
67624,"After Lee surrendered at Appomattox, Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston considered the war to be a lost cause and sought terms of peace with his nemesis-in-blue, General William T. Sherman. This print celebrates the formal surrender of Johnston’s army on April 26, 1865, near Greensboro, North Carolina.   After the war, Johnston and Sherman, both West Pointers, became friends. In February 1891, Johnston served as a pallbearer at Sherman’s funeral in New York City, where he caught a cold and died of complications from pneumonia the next month."
67641,"James Buchanan is considered one of the least successful U.S. presidents because of his passive and hapless handling of the sectional crisis at the end of the 1850s. A Pennsylvanian, he was nonetheless pro-southern, and his candidacy for the presidency in 1856 contributed to the breakdown of the existing national parties into sectional entities. Elected with strong southern support, Buchanan could not defuse the growing crisis over slavery in the territories, especially in “Bleeding” Kansas, as he took an overly legalistic approach to a problem that had inflamed the populace. At its 1860 convention, the Democratic Party broke into northern and southern wings on the slavery question, with Stephen Douglas defeating Buchanan for the nomination. During the secession winter following Abraham Lincoln’s election, Buchanan dithered as both sections prepared for war."
67699,"Born Clark, Missouri  After leading troops to victory in North Africa and Sicily, Omar Bradley was selected by General Dwight Eisenhower to command the First U.S. Army during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. He was the architect of “Operation Cobra,” which unleashed American troops across southern Normandy; under his direction, American forces liberated Paris and linked up with Soviet troops to force the collapse of Nazi forces on the Western Front, thereby defeating Germany in Europe.  In the final year of the war, Bradley commanded more troops than any general in American history—in excess of 1.3 million soldiers. Eisenhower called him “the master tactician of our forces.”  Bradley succeeded Eisenhower as U.S. Army Chief of Staff in 1948. The following year, he became the first-ever chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He was promoted to the rank of five-star General of the Army in 1950."
67737,"Writer and philosopher Jean Toomer was an influential voice in the African American cultural resurgence known as the Harlem Renaissance. Most well-known for Cane (1923), a collection of modernist poems and vignettes that juxtaposed scenes in the urban North with observations about the rural South, Toomer was sensitive to the role that race played in American society. Yet he tried to look beyond race as a category that defined individuals. The grandson of the first U.S. governor of African American descent, he bristled at being described as a ""Negro writer."" Having ""seen the divisions, the separatisms and the antagonisms,"" he believed optimistically that ""a new man was arising in this country-not European, not African, not Asiatic-but American."" Toomer's portrait was taken by his wife, Marjorie Content, a well-respected fine art photographer, at about the time of their marriage in 1934."
67896,"Born Gloucester, England  Renowned for his Old Testament oratory, English evangelist George Whitefield was a leading figure in the wave of religious revivalism that swept America in the 1730s and 1740s. The son of innkeepers, Whitefield first traveled to America in 1738, where he embarked on missionary work and established a successful orphanage and school in Georgia. During several extended visits to America, he traveled widely and became one of the most publicized figures of the fervent religious movement known as the Great Awakening. Although many Anglican leaders disapproved of Whitefield’s methods, his sermons stimulated new religious zeal throughout the colonies. Benjamin Franklin once observed that Whitefield’s voice was so powerful that it could be heard at the outermost fringe of a crowd of 30,000 and that its eloquence had moved the normally skeptical Franklin to empty his pockets ""wholly into the collector’s plate, gold and all."" "
67915,"Within two months of James Madison’s declaration of war in June 1812, American dreams of an easy conquest of Canada were dashed with the surrender of Fort Detroit. The fort’s commander, Brigadier General William Hull, was nearly sixty years old; with experienced commanders in short supply, this veteran of the American Revolution had been drafted back into service. Hull fell victim to the manipulations of British general Isaac Brock, who—allied with Tecumseh—raised the specter of a massacre by the Indians if the fort did not surrender. Witnesses reported that Hull cowered in fear and was drunk, drooling, and mumbling incoherently in the face of what he saw as certain slaughter. Called a coward and traitor by his peers, Hull was court-martialed and sentenced to be shot. President Madison commuted the sentence, but Hull never recovered his reputation. "
67993,"Born Springfield, Pennsylvania    Benjamin West was on his way back to Philadelphia after three years of art study in Italy when he arrived in London in 1763. Soon finding himself under the patronage of King George III, he never left. The first American artist to achieve an international reputation, West had an even greater claim to fame, nurturing three generations of American artists who came to him for teaching, direction, and good counsel. ""He never, indeed, appeared to be more gratified,"" a contemporary observed, ""than when engaged in enlightening the minds of those who looked up to him for instruction.""  West's portrait here shows him during the period he was at work on The Death of General Wolfe, a landmark in the development of history painting. This epic event, which occurred at the 1759 Battle of Quebec, determined that the British, rather than the French, would control the North American continent."
68013,"Boris Chaliapin’s first cover for Time magazine appeared on August 24, 1942, and portrayed India’s future prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. This portrait of President Richard Nixon ran on October 5, 1970, and was Chaliapin’s last published cover. In those twenty-eight years, he would be Time’s most prolific artist, producing 413 covers. Of Nixon alone—who holds the record for Time cover appearances at fifty-five—Chaliapin produced multiple portraits, beginning with Nixon’s first appearance on Time (August 25, 1952), as Dwight Eisenhower’s vice-presidential running mate."
68024,"Before Marianne Moore, female poets were outliers in the American poetical tradition. Poets like Hilda Doolittle (“H. D.”) were known and respected up to a point but were largely pushed to the margins. Marianne Moore changed all of that. She wrote poetry that was wholly original and of obvious high quality; she could not be dismissed or condescended to. She also influenced subsequent poets, especially Elizabeth Bishop (seen elsewhere in this exhibition). Poetically, Moore exceeded Ezra Pound’s edict to “make it new,” concocting new verse forms—a line that seemed like prose but wasn’t, based in part on counting syllables—that she married to her close, empirical observation. In her “manifesto” poem, called “Poetry,” she begins: “I, too, dislike it: there are things that are important beyond all this fiddle. / Reading it, however, with a perfect contempt for it, one discovers in / it after all, a place for the genuine.” Moore loved observing animals, especially at the zoo. And she was a devoted baseball fan, a pastime that most modernist poets would never have owned up to! Moore was also a charismatic figure at readings and literary gatherings, standing out with her distinctive tricorn hat. But her influence as a writer made her a trailblazer for the growing presence of women poets in American literature."
68064,"Born Washington, D.C.   ""Music is my mistress, and she plays second fiddle to no one,"" exclaimed the famed composer, bandleader, and pianist Duke Ellington. During a career that spanned six decades, he rose to international stardom and helped to reshape the contours of American music. Raised in Washington, D.C., Ellington formed his first jazz band at age nineteen. He made a name for himself in the late 1920s at the Cotton Club in Harlem, where he performed a regular gig that was broadcast nationally on the radio. With songs such as ""Solitude"" and ""In a Sentimental Mood,"" Ellington achieved widespread popularity with diverse audiences. He first performed abroad in 1933, and so successful were his concerts that he later toured the globe under the auspices of the U.S. State Department. In this photograph, Ellington is seated at the piano; playing trumpet beside him are the famed musicians Dizzy Gillespie (left) and Buck Clayton (right)."

Mower (1827-1870)    After the Norwegian artist Ole Peter Hansen Balling had sketched President Lincoln at the White House in the fall of 1864, he obtained permission to paint life portraits of leading Union generals. Balling joined General Grant at City Point, Virginia, during the campaign against Richmond and spent five weeks there sketching officers in the field. Philip H. Sheridan was painted while in the Shenandoah Valley; the portraits of William T. Sherman and George H. Thomas were done in Washington after the end of the war. The image of George A. Custer, second from the left, is thought to be the only life portrait painted of him."
68143,"Hugo Gellert's portrait of actor Paul Robeson illustrated a 1928 New Yorker ""Profiles"" feature. Acclaimed for his leading roles in the musical Show Boat and some of Eugene O'Neill's plays, Robeson was at the height of his popularity despite his controversial, left-wing political activism. Gellert shared his commitment to fight for social justice through art, and the two became friends.  Despite its modest size, the isolated head has a monumental quality that conveys Robeson's dignified personality, rich bass voice, and commanding stage presence. The cubist-influenced stylization-dark crescents of shading, zigzagging rows of hair, and angular faceting of the features-sets up strong rhythmic patterns that add to its power. Gellert exhibited a copy of the portrait at the 1939 New York World's Fair and later incorporated the image into a mural of famous Americans."
68151,"George Steers registered his first great success as a naval architect with his design of the Mary Taylor (1849), a schooner that established New York pilot boats as among the fastest in the world. Steers remained in the forefront of modern shipbuilding by producing such notable vessels as the steam-frigate Niagara, which helped to lay the first transatlantic cable. It was as the designer of pleasure craft, however, that he secured his reputation. His world-famous America (1851), made on commission from a syndicate of New York Yacht Club members, revolutionized yacht design on both sides of the Atlantic."
68155,"When this print was published in 1867, General George B. McClellan—the former general in chief of the Union army and the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate in 1864—was on an extended sojourn through Europe with his family. The McClellans’ overseas itinerary, however, would not have mattered to admirers of the general, who were seeking an idealized picture of a notable American household in the postwar era. Family portraiture filled the public’s fascination for celebrity much like People magazine does today; seeing pictures of the famous relaxing at home with their families was the next best thing to stepping into their parlors. Here we see Mrs. McClellan—Nelly—who was known for her intelligence and beauty. In front of her stands George B. McClellan Jr., a future mayor of New York City, while young May stands by her father. "
68163,"An impresario of modern American design, Frank Lloyd Wright was a master builder who founded the Prairie School of architecture. His organic approach to design was exemplified by Fallingwater, the cantilevered Pennsylvania house he built in the mid-1930s, and by the custom-made ""Usonian"" homes he designed in that period to modernize domestic life: instead of dividing interior spaces into rooms with specific functions, Wright introduced larger ""workspaces"" with progressively more open areas. He also made use of such new building materials as concrete, glass bricks, and Pyrex tubing.    Based at his Taliesin and Taliesin West studios (in Wisconsin and Arizona, respectively) and surrounded by a fellowship of apprentice architects, Wright designed more than 1,000 projects, including the Johnson Wax headquarters, the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, and the Guggenheim Museum-perhaps the leading example of his fascination for the enveloping shape he called the ""architecture of the within."" "
68183,"The daughter of poor sharecroppers, Fannie Lou Hamer joined the civil rights movement at age forty-five, when she agreed to work in a voter registration drive for Mississippi blacks. Joining in the fight to end the South's systematic disenfranchisement of African Americans cost Hamer her job. She was not to be deterred, however. By the summer of 1964, having made significant inroads on registration, she was at the Democratic National Convention, challenging the legitimacy of Mississippi's all-white delegation. Winning only two seats for her cause, she considered the effort a failure. Yet Hamer and her following had clearly jolted the national conscience, and the days of whites-only politics in the South were numbered.  Hamer is here seen participating in the March Against Fear from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, in June 1966 to dramatize the determination of African Americans to win recognition for their full rights as citizens."
68192,"Music is your own experience, your own thoughts,   your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out   of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line   to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.    Jazz musician and saxophonist Charlie (""Bird"") Parker was a pioneer of mid-twentieth-century free jazz and later the bebop movement. Parker's deconstruction of traditional jazz melodies allowed him to accelerate and lengthen the individual lines of his solos. This was the musical equivalent of Whitman's breaking of the iambic pentameter line and creating free verse.  Tragically, Parker's career was marked by heavy drug use as he sought to erase the boundary line between the individual and the art."
68206,"Born Whitingham, Vermont  Brigham Young converted to Mormonism in 1832 and gradually rose in the organization’s leadership until he became the head of the Twelve Apostles under Joseph Smith. After Smith’s murder by an anti-Mormon mob in 1844, Young managed a larger portion of the church. In 1847 he led the Mormons from Nebraska to the Great Basin, where he founded Salt Lake City as the new church headquarters. He oversaw the migration of tens of thousands of Mormon converts to the West and the founding of hundreds of settlements. The Mormon majority elected Young as governor, but he was soon replaced by an appointed territorial governor. Political conflicts and challenges to the Mormons’ separatist communal and theocratic venture led the United States to dispatch troops to Utah in 1857 and assert federal authority. "
68207,"Creating a distinctly American verse, Walt Whitman kicked down the doors and jambs of genteel Anglo-American literature and took poetry out into the streets and roads of a turbulent and expansive democracy. Whitman sounded his ""barbaric yawp"" across rooftops and into Leaves of Grass (first published in 1855). His poetic tendency to list, categorize, or catalogue was a legacy of the Enlightenment, yet his joyful earthiness was a far cry from the Enlightenment’s cool rationalism. And whereas his contemporaries, especially Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, recoiled from the unfixed and unmoored nature of American society, Whitman alone vaulted into the future, not simply walking on the open road but building it as he went along, surveying the ever-changing face of America and Americans. Whitman was also one of the first Americans to comprehend the power of photography to shape a reputation. Photography’s ability to project multiple, diverse personas to the public was naturally appealing to a poet celebrating his—and our—multiple selves. Everywhere and nowhere—that is the paradox of Walt Whitman. In all of his chanting, he still has time to sum himself up in a way that endures: ""I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured. / I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)."""
68214,"The Great (In)Censor of the Public Press    Shortly after Edwin Stanton assumed his new duties as secretary of war, he immediately began a reorganization of the War Department and implemented strict policies for conducting business both on and off the battlefield. One of his edicts was to restrict what the press was reporting about the war. In May 1862, during the Peninsular Campaign in Virginia, the editors of Vanity Fair mocked Stanton for his alleged censorship of the press and restrictions of news reports from the battlefield."
68229,"Born near the Grand River, in present-day South Dakota    Beginning in the 1860s, Sitting Bull gained a reputation as one of the most formidable warriors during the three-decade-long conflict between the Lakota nation and the United States. On repeated occasions he led campaigns to rid the growing American presence from traditional tribal lands. In 1874, when officials tried to persuade a group of chiefs to cede the Black Hills-where George Armstrong Custer had recently discovered gold-Sitting Bull intervened to stop the transaction. Two years later, his forces would rout Custer's Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Big Horn, an event that prompted American officials to expand their military commitment in the West. Sitting Bull and a group of followers eluded authorities until 1881, when defections and a dwindling food supply compelled him to surrender. In 1885 Sitting Bull traveled for four months with William Cody's Wild West Show, during which time this photograph is believed to have been taken."
68243,"In 1941, as war raged in Europe and the Pacific, British prime minister Winston Churchill traveled to Washington for meetings with President Franklin Roosevelt before continuing on to Ottawa, where he delivered a rousing speech before the Canadian Parliament on December 30. Canada’s prime minister, Mackenzie King—an early admirer of Yousuf Karsh’s work—arranged for Karsh to attend Churchill’s address and to be in position to photograph the British leader as he later passed through the Speaker’s Chamber. Surprised to discover that he was to be photographed, Churchill grudgingly agreed to give Karsh two minutes for the shot but declined the photographer’s gentle entreaty to relinquish his freshly lit cigar. Undeterred, Karsh deftly removed the cigar from Churchill’s mouth and quickly made his exposure as Britain’s “roaring lion” glowered at the camera. The resulting image—one of the twentieth century’s most iconic portraits—effectively launched Karsh’s international career.  In 1963 Churchill became the first foreign national to be granted honorary U.S. citizenship by the U.S. Congress."
68318,"Arthur Leipzig's portrait shows Sidney Bechet at the legendary New York nightclub Jimmy Ryan's, playing the soprano saxophone, the instrument for which Bechet was most celebrated. Together with Louis Armstrong, he helped to bring New Orleans jazz to the world. Although no less talented, Bechet never attained the popularity that Armstrong achieved in America, in part because of his often bristly personality. Yet critics and fellow musicians recognized his musical genius and respected his commitment to ""doing it your own way."" As one reviewer wrote in 1919, when Bechet was only twenty-two, his ""'own way' is perhaps the highway [on which] the whole world will swing along tomorrow."" To Armstrong, his playing was like a ""jug full of golden honey."" After a lifetime of touring, Bechet moved in 1951 to Paris, where he enjoyed a wide following.  "
68334,"A leader in the Cigarmakers International Union in the 1870s, Samuel Gompers took issue with those who saw unions as vehicles for political influence or the transformation of capitalism: he believed that the labor movement's sole purpose was to improve wages, hours, and working conditions. Adhering to this limited mission, he organized the American Federation of Labor in 1886 and made it the most influential union in America. When he posed for this bust in the last year of his life, he told the sculptor, Moses Dykaar, ""I want bread and butter for the working man and an hour to think.""  "
68439,"Sylvia Beach loved books, and, having a special passion for French literature, she once toyed with opening a French bookstore in New York City. A French friend convinced her to instead establish a combination bookstore and lending library in Paris, specializing in English and American books. Called Shakespeare and Company, the enterprise at first drew a mostly French clientele. By the early 1920s, it had become a major gathering place for the English and American writers who flocked to Paris after World War I, and its patrons eventually included John Dos Passos, Ezra Pound, and Ernest Hemingway. Beach's most notable contribution to Anglo-American letters, however, was the  role she played in publishing James Joyce's groundbreaking novel Ulysses after it became clear that the work's sexual frankness precluded its publication in Britain. "
68462,"The critic has always played an important role in American culture. From Ralph Waldo Emerson to Walter Lippmann, critical writing sharpened the sense of what it meant to be American and also pointed to the future. In American art, there has been no more important writer than Clement Greenberg, whose work was essential in shaping postwar culture. An unsuccessful poet, Greenberg began writing criticism and commentary, finding a home in midcentury magazines like The Nation. Greenberg was both profoundly nationalistic and relentlessly avant garde in his critical stance. A formalist, he argued that American abstractionists were at the leading edge of world art, advancing the history of painting as it moved inexorably toward pure abstraction. In this representational portrait by René Bouché, Greenberg is shown doing what he did best: thinking—with typewriter at hand. "
68485,"At the beginning of the Civil War, the Confederacy was confident that revenues from the sale of southern cotton would sustain its struggle for independence. Northerners, however, thought otherwise, as reflected in the following poem, which speaks to this cartoon showing President Jefferson Davis with a noose of hemp around his neck, predicting the North's triumph over the cotton-producing South.  Jeff Davis boasts that  ""Cotton's King;""  Upon his throne's so  written;  But he'll soon find, when on  his swing,  That Hemp is King of Cotton."
68507,"George C. Marshall was, according to one expert observer, the ""perfect"" soldier. Endowed with a quick mind, a good memory, and a superb sense of strategy, he did not particularly relish war. Yet as chief of staff during World War II, he proved to be a masterful orchestrator of military mobilization. In 1945 President Harry Truman remarked that millions of Americans had served the country well in that conflict, but it had been Marshall who ""gave it victory."" As capable in peace as in wartime, Marshall later became Truman's secretary of state, and it was he who unveiled in 1947 the American aid program for rebuilding Europe's war-ravaged economies. Ultimately named the Marshall Plan, this venture became one of the greatest triumphs in the entire history of American diplomacy.  "
68536,"The New York Yankees had high hopes for Roger Maris when they acquired him in a trade in 1960, and the pull-hitting right fielder did not disappoint them. In his debut game with the Bronx Bombers, Maris exploded with two home runs, a double, a single, and four runs batted in. By the season's close he owned the American League's Most Valuable Player award and a Gold Glove. But if Maris's first season in Yankee pinstripes was promising, the 1961 season saw the promise fulfilled. After a slow start in April, Maris suddenly found himself in a home run derby with teammate Mickey Mantle that put both players in contention to overtake Babe Ruth's single-season record of sixty homers. It was Maris who prevailed, and on the final day of the season, he entered the record books with home run number sixty-one."
68624,"Born Glastonbury, Connecticut     For Gideon Welles, the job of secretary of the navy was daunting from the start because the United States had almost no effective navy to speak of, and what vessels were in existence were mostly old and scattered around the globe. Moreover, many senior officers resigned during the secession crisis. In spite of these difficulties, Welles succeeded in building a navy that played a vital role in winning the war. His implementation of the Union's blockade of the Confederate coast was typical of the challenges he faced with a makeshift fleet. Yet in time, this grand strategy eventually proved effective. Welles's endorsement of ironclad vessels was also ambitious for its day and had many influential detractors, but it anticipated the direction of the modern navy.   This photograph by Mathew Brady's studio is perhaps the best existing view of Welles's ill-fitting wig, which received ample notice in his day."
68804,"  Not only were Igor Stravinsky's musical compositions powerful and even shocking in their time, but the man himself was striking. The Russian-born avant-garde composer, whose bitonalities and eccentric rhythms influenced generations of musicians, had oversized features that seemed unsuited to his small head and five-foot three-inch physique. Rico Lebrun, however, found power and dignity in his almost ugly profile. At the time of this drawing, composer and artist were engaged in similar projects: Lebrun had started painting a Crucifixion cycle, and Stravinsky was working on a liturgical Mass. Both artists reworked traditional forms to emphasize monumentality and essential structure. As Stravinsky wrote, ""the more art is controlled, limited, worked over, the more it is free."" Lebrun's charcoal portrait is conceived with minimal detail but powerful effect, much like Stravinsky's music."
68865,"The Democratic presidential primaries of 1968 were darkened by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., race riots, and protests against the Vietnam War. For the May 24 cover that year, Time magazine featured Senator Robert Kennedy, who was attracting crowds of supporters with his antiwar stance and support of racial equality. The cover artist, Roy Lichtenstein, was as famous and controversial as Kennedy. Beginning in 1961, Lichtenstein had shocked the sensibilities of the art world by basing his pop art paintings upon comic-book illustrations and advertisements. Lichtenstein rarely chose real people as subjects, but he was intrigued by Kennedy's ""lively, upstart quality and pop-heroic proportions as part of a legend."" In this key drawing for the cover's color separations, Lichtenstein portrayed Kennedy as a cartoon-perfect champion of truth and justice, just weeks before the senator's assassination.  "
68920,"Born Fairview, Kentucky     A reluctant secessionist at the start, by the end of the Civil War Jefferson Davis had long since become a resolute believer in the legitimacy and cause of the Confederacy. As its former president, he was imprisoned for treason at Fort Monroe, Virginia, before his release on bail in 1867. Reunited with his wife and children, Davis, at age fifty-nine, was hard-pressed to find an occupation he deemed worthy of his interests and talents. Meanwhile, he attended veteran reunions in the South, relishing the tributes paid him for his dedicated service. In 1881 he published two volumes of his wartime experiences, The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government. Written in Beauvoir, the last house he would occupy, the property overlooking the Mississippi Gulf Coast remains a Davis memorial and popular historical attraction."
68938,"Gerald Ford was perfectly happy being a Michigan congressman and House minority leader. But Ford's congressional career abruptly ended in 1973, when President Richard Nixon appointed him to succeed Vice President Spiro Agnew, who had resigned amid revelations of misconduct. Within a year, Ford's political fortunes took yet another sharp turn. On August 9, 1974, with Nixon himself forced to resign from office, Ford became the only unelected vice president to succeed to the White House.  Ford's pardoning of Nixon shortly thereafter drew angry criticism. Nevertheless, his conciliatory leadership succeeded in restoring a much-eroded confidence in the presidency. Summarizing the orderly way he came to office despite the unsettling events that put him there, he said at his swearing-in, ""Our Constitution works."" In large measure, it was Ford who insured that it did.  Everett Raymond Kinstler's likeness was painted at Ford's request specifically for the National Portrait Gallery. Kinstler based the portrait on sketches that he had made in the late 1970s, when he was working on Ford's official White House likeness."
69048,"Born New York City      Recalling how she had once reduced co-workers to tears with false tales of her poverty, Fanny Brice knew early on that the stage was her proper milieu. But when she finally entered the world of professional entertainment, it was comedy, not pathos, that proved to be her forte. Upon seeing her parody of the dance of Salome, producer Florenz Ziegfeld immediately hired her for his Follies of 1910, where her genius for satiric mimicry won her overnight stardom. Of the many characterizations Brice created, the most famous was “Baby Snooks,” an incorrigibly demonic child that she first played in 1912 and would later reprise on the radio. This photograph by Ziegfeld Follies photographer Alfred Cheney Johnston shows Brice in a glamorous light that is at odds with the cross-eyed, grimacing awkwardness that was the trademark of her stage persona."
69060,"The Harmon Foundation, a philanthropic organization based in New York City and active from (1922-1967) included this portrait in their exhibition “Portraits of Outstanding Americans of Negro Origins” which documented noteworthy African Americans’ contributions to the country. Modeling their goal of social equality, the Harmon sought portraits from an African-American artist, Laura Wheeler Waring and Euro-American artist, Betsy Graves Reyneau.  The two painters  followed the conventional codes of academic portraiture, seeking to convey their sitters extraordinary accomplishments.  This painting, along with a variety of educational materials, toured nation-wide for ten years serving as a visual rebuttal to racism."
69147,"Seated on the floor with five men from Zuni Pueblo, anthropologist Frank Hamilton Cushing wears a costume typical of that southwestern tribe. In his five-year sojourn with the Zuni beginning in 1879, Cushing became famous for taking an active part in nearly every element of the tribe's secular and sacred life. In doing so, he pioneered the participant method of field observation, an important albeit controversial contribution to the field of ethnology. The Zuni welcomed Cushing and eventually admitted him to the Priesthood of the Bow, a prestigious tribal society. Cushing conducted his work under the direction of the Bureau of American Ethnology. In part to repay the hospitality showed him, Cushing arranged for a Zuni delegation to travel east in 1882 to meet with President Chester A. Arthur and other government and scientific officials. This photograph was taken during a side trip to Boston."
69187,"The enduring popularity of Lillian Russell as the prima donna of the American light opera stage had as much to do with her renowned beauty and flair for publicity as her voice and stage presence. The photographic face in this poster, suggesting the sweet and youthful heroines of Russell's many comic operas, is typical of late nineteenth-century commercial advertising. The elaborate ornamentation of the frame, however, and the subtle color stippling of the background show the influence of the French-inspired artistic poster movement on commercial printing firms in America. The unidentified artist from the Strobridge Lithography Company posed Russell's face against a marbleized wallpaper design within an elaborate frame inspired by contemporary stained glass and ornamented with bamboo fronds. The image is further embellished with an elegant monogram of initials, lilies, and a lyre, whose spiraling curls are echoed in the lettering of the name."
69192,"Wendell Phillips's fiery speeches galvanized the faithful and converted the wavering to the cause of erasing slavery from American society. A Boston lawyer, Phillips shot to attention as an orator with his fervent 1837 attack on the southern ""slaveocracy"" after a pro-slavery mob murdered crusading newspaperman Elijah Lovejoy. Phillips was a disciple of William Lloyd Garrison, and like his mentor he came to the radical position that slavery had so infected America that the Constitution itself was tainted. After the Civil War, Phillips continued as a social reformer and was one of the first leaders of the American labor movement."
69268,"This portrait of Mark Strand is by the realist painter Philip Pearlstein, who has always resisted abstraction for an almost transparent representational style. Pearlstein’s portrait fits Mark Strand, whose language is precise in its descriptive clarity. Yet just as Pearlstein hints at melancholy in the poet’s expression, Strand’s clarity is in the service of a vision that is disturbing and alienating. The frightening poem ""My Life"" ends: ""I grow into my death. / My life is small / and getting smaller. The world is green. / Nothing is all."" One can hardly imagine a more bleak conclusion, yet it is held at bay by the very creative act of making a poem out of such bleakness."
69338,"Singer Mahalia Jackson created a worldwide audience for gospel music with her soul-stirring performances and immensely popular recordings. Although influenced in her youth by blues legend Bessie Smith, Jackson was unwavering in her commitment to gospel, and excluded blues and jazz from her repertoire. Church choirs served as the first showcase for her talent, but her majestic voice soon marked her for a solo career. Touring widely throughout the 1930s, Jackson thrilled audiences as she performed gospel favorites in storefront churches, tent shows, and revival meetings. Her breakthrough came in 1947, when her recording of ""Move On Up a Little Higher"" sold more than one million copies, confirming her as the ""Gospel Queen."" A fervent voice for civil rights, Jackson performed numerous benefit concerts in support of the movement and was a favorite of Martin Luther King Jr."
69383,"I fell in love with her and . . . I have never fallen out.    It is difficult to know the character of the Lincoln relationship. When Lincoln wed Mary Todd in 1842, he married into a well-established Illinois family. Mary was strong-willed, capricious, and adamant. When she eventually showed signs of derangement, her instability colored discussions of her earlier years. Both of Lincoln's secretaries hated her and gained their revenge in their memoirs of the White House years. But from the best evidence, Lincoln was patient with a woman who could be difficult, not least because she suffered terribly at the death of their sons. After Willie died in 1862, she became increasingly fearful and detached, worrying about Lincoln himself, consulting spiritualists, and spending time away from Washington. This small sketch seems to show her departing on such a trip, and the artist has juxtaposed the figures to suggest a gap or tension between them that will never be fully known."
69554,"Born Cornish, New Hampshire    As a lawyer and antislavery leader in Ohio, Salmon P. Chase was known as the ""attorney general"" for runaway slaves. In 1855 he cast his lot with the new Republican Party and soon vied with William Henry Seward for its leadership. A candidate for the party's presidential nomination in 1860, he lost to Abraham Lincoln but was named secretary of the treasury in the new cabinet.   Although Chase helped to write the Emancipation Proclamation, his relations with Lincoln became strained. The personal antagonism between Chase and Secretary of State Seward weakened the cabinet, and that, combined with Chase's insatiable desire to become president, eventually led to his replacement. In 1864 Lincoln appointed him chief justice of the Supreme Court, where he showed political wisdom in handling constitutional problems created by the Civil War and Reconstruction. "
69555,"A pioneer in the establishment of independent black churches, Thomas Paul was educated at the Free Will Baptist Church in Hollis, New Hampshire, and came to Boston as an itinerant preacher. In August 1805 he led the effort to found the African Baptist Church, and by the end of the year a meeting house (which stands today as the oldest surviving black church building in America) was completed on Beacon Hill. During the next twenty-five years, Paul exerted strong leadership over a growing congregation and won fame as he expanded his missionary work. Famed diarist Reverend William Bentley of Salem went to hear Paul speak and recorded: ""He impressed the audience with a regard to his sincerity & many with a sense of his talents. His person is good.""  "
69682,"Even though his relationship with Dwight Eisenhower was difficult, Richard Nixon became one of the most consequential vice presidents in American history. During the 1952 campaign and afterward, Ike used Nixon to lead the ""all-out combat"" against the Democrats, which allowed the president to be above the fray, a seemingly nonpartisan head of state. Nixon also served as Ike's liaison with Congress, overseeing passage of the 1957 Civil Rights Bill and Ike's behind-the-scenes campaign against Senator Joseph McCarthy. He was also Ike's representative on highly visible international trips, such as his 1959 visit to Moscow for the opening of the American National Exhibition which produced the famous ""kitchen debate."" There, Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev traded inanities about which nation was winning the Cold War, a debate that was nonetheless a fascinating public event.  "
69752,"The most brilliant scientist of the twentieth century, physicist Albert Einstein inspires comparisons to Isaac Newton. By the time he reached thirty, his theory of relativity and work in quantum mechanics had revolutionized physics and profoundly altered our perception of the world.  Einstein naturally commanded great prestige in the United States when he sought refuge from the Nazi regime of his native Germany in 1933. His words thus carried enormous weight in 1939 when he wrote a letter alerting President Roosevelt that Germany was moving toward the development of nuclear weaponry. Eventually, that warning gave impetus to the Manhattan Project, the top-secret venture that in 1945 produced the world's first atomic bomb.  While sitting for this likeness in 1944, Einstein mused to his portraitist, ""After fifty years they will say of me, either he was a great man or a fool!"""
69814,"Charlie Chaplin was one of cinema's first stars. Discovered in 1913 by producer Mack Sennett, the head of Keystone Studios, Chaplin achieved unprecedented popular and financial success during film's silent era. His creation of the Tramp-a screen persona that combined comedy with endearing pathos-won him great acclaim during his first years with Sennett, and he returned to this character repeatedly over his career. Such popularity also allowed him to create, direct, and act in his own films, independent from the major studios' control. The resulting motion pictures consistently broke new ground in this burgeoning industry. Sensitive to the events of the day, Chaplin made films that satirized contemporary society and politics, including Modern Times (1936) and The Great Dictator (1940).   Steichen counted Chaplin among his favorite subjects and described this engaging portrait as ""the image of a dancing faun."""
69878,"Born Anne Arundel County, Maryland    Joseph Galloway, the powerful longtime Speaker of the Pennsylvania Assembly, believed that colonial grievances (which he freely admitted having) should be addressed through orderly petition rather than by clamor in the streets. Appalled by the War for Independence, Galloway stood with the mother country. In late 1778 he departed his native land, leaving his wife, Grace, behind to protest the confiscation of family property.  This miniature was painted in England, where Galloway spent the rest of his life."
69916,"  Inventor and millionaire industrialist Peter Cooper was one of the outstanding American businessmen of the nineteenth century. After making his initial fortune in the glue business, Cooper revolutionized the nation's railroad industry by designing and building the first successful American steam locomotive (1830). A generous philanthropist who viewed wealth as a trust to be used ""for the education and uplifting of the common people,"" he founded New York City's Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (1857)-an innovative institution that offered free vocational courses to adults with the desire but not the means to obtain an education.   "
69923,"Born Denison, Texas   With a talent for military strategy and the ability to work effectively with personalities of all types, General Dwight D. Eisenhower proved uniquely suited to the demanding role of supreme allied commander during World War II. A career army officer, Eisenhower began his wartime service in 1941 as head of the War Plans Division under General George C. Marshall. He was assigned to lead U.S. forces in Britain in the spring of 1942, and later commanded the Allied forces’ invasions of North Africa, Sicily, and Italy (1942–43). Named supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force by President Roosevelt in December 1943, Eisenhower masterminded the invasion of Normandy on June 6, 1944, and directed Allied operations in Europe until the surrender of Germany in May 1945. Enormously popular with the American public after the war, Eisenhower was elected to the presidency in 1952 and served two terms."
69924,"Born Kenosha, Wisconsin  For actor-director Orson Welles, the impulse to innovate was second nature. By 1937, his unorthodox staging of such classics as Shakespeare’s Macbeth and Julius Caesar had established him as the theater’s ""Wonder Boy."" Welles proved equally inventive when he turned to directing, and in the late 1930s he raised radio drama to new levels of sophistication. His 1938 adaptation of H.G. Welles’s ""The War of the Worlds"" for the Mercury Theatre of the Air on CBS was so compelling that many panicked listeners believed aliens had actually landed in New Jersey. The most celebrated testament to his genius, however, was the landmark motion picture Citizen Kane (1941). In addition to producing and directing this unconventional film, the twenty-five-year-old Welles co-authored the script and played the title role. Citizen Kane was not a commercial success, but it influenced countless filmmakers thanks to the innovative cinematic techniques that Welles pioneered."
71240,"Born Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  Dubbed the “Golden Arm,” Johnny Unitas is widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest quarterbacks in professional football history. Unitas led the Baltimore Colts, where he played for seventeen of his eighteen years in the National Football League, to three championships, winning three trophies for most valuable player and invitations to ten Pro Bowl games along the way.  This life portrait of Unitas by Merv Corning—one of the more than 300 portraits of NFL players that the self-taught artist made beginning in 1967—shows Unitas as many on the field saw him: a leader known for his steely determination and keen strategizing. Commissioned by David Boss, the NFL’s pioneering creative director for a quarter of a century, it also reveals the rising significance of image-making, marketing, and branding in professional sports."
72387,"Born Bradford, Pennsylvania    Mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne is celebrated as one of the most remarkable voices of the twentieth century. A brilliant interpreter, she is a master of Bellini and Rossini as well as Handel and Bach. She launched her show business career at age four by singing at a rally for Franklin Roosevelt, but her professional start came in 1954, when she dubbed the singing voice of Dorothy Dandridge in the film Carmen Jones. Horne's 1970 debut at the Metropolitan Opera was as Adalgisa in Bellini's Norma (depicted here). With soprano Joan Sutherland, she ushered in a new golden age of bel canto opera, notably in Norma, Semiramide, and Anna Bolena. Revered also for her concert and recital singing, she founded the Marilyn Horne Foundation in 1994 to train rising young stars in the vocal art tradition."
84273,"Born Draguignan, France  A diminutive opera singer who enchanted audiences with her soaring coloratura soprano and vivacious charm, Lily Pons was the Metropolitan Opera’s principal star for more than two decades. Pons was in her early twenties when she shelved plans for a career as a concert pianist and embraced singing instead. Discovered by European opera stars Giovanni Zenatello and Maria Gay, who encouraged her to audition for the Metropolitan Opera, Pons created a sensation with her Met debut in Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor (1931). Wisely confining her repertoire to operas that showcased her ability to reach the highest notes with ease, Pons built her reputation as a singer of the first rank. She also developed a popular following among fans who were captivated by her glamour both on stage and off. Pons became a U.S. citizen in 1940 and performed tirelessly for combat troops serving overseas during World War II."
84322,"Born San Francisco, California  Costumed in a Greek tunic and performing barefoot, Isadora Duncan radiated change. Her message was that traditional dance such as ballet reflected the past, while the dawning century demanded a new form of movement that celebrated the unconstricted body and reflected the dynamism of contemporary life.  She transfixed audiences as she bolted, jumped, and skipped across the stage. Her performance of “the new” attracted not only society’s upper crust—she performed at Mrs. Vanderbilt’s salon—but also Russian revolutionaries. Lenin invited her to Moscow in 1921, and she established a school there to teach a dance style that merged movement, theater, and music.   Duncan’s objective, she explained, was to harmonize “the natural language of the soul” with “the movement of the body.” Extolled as “the Light of Tomorrow” and “a torch that lights the path of progress,” she said of her work, “I see America dancing.” "
84324,"Born into a family of tailors and seamstresses, Pauline Trigère seemed destined for the clothing business. By age ten, she could operate a sewing machine, and her father had taught her how to get the most out of a bolt of cloth. When her family's New York dress business failed in the early 1940s, Trigère pawned her few bits of valuable jewelry and struck out on her own. Although her first season's collection consisted of only eleven dresses, it proved a huge success. Before long, the nation's most prestigious stores were clamoring for her elegant designs.  Upon hearing that a long-time customer had been buried in one of her creations, Trigère said, only half jesting, ""You see? With a Trigère you can go anywhere."" One of her goals was to create versatile clothing that women would want to wear indefinitely. "
84330,"Born Canajoharie, Mohawk Valley, New York    Mohawk Indian war chief Thayendanegea (who had converted to Christianity under the name of Joseph Brant), an English protégé and a colonel in the British army, was instrumental in persuading the Iroquois to take up arms against the American rebels.  He was a chief organizer of Indian bands allied to the British, and his forces became the scourge of independence-minded settlers on the New York and Pennsylvania frontiers.   Resettled by the British in Canada after the Revolutionary War, Brant visited Albany in 1806, a rich man dressed in white man's clothing.  At the request of a former Loyalist comrade-in-arms, he agreed to sit for his portrait, but only after makeshift Native attire was rounded up.  He thought it ""a compromise of his dignity to be painted in his civilized garb."""
84350,"Katherine Stinson set out to become a pilot simply to finance her piano education. By the summer of 1912, however, when she finally received her pilot's license, interest in the piano waned compared with her passion for aviation. Said by some to be the first woman pilot to ever ""loop the loop,"" she went her fellow aviators one better in 1915 when she invented the ""dippy twist loop,"" a maneuver that required rolling her plane wing over wing at the top of each loop. During Stinson's tour of Asia the following year, Japanese women went wild with excitement to see one of their own sex engaging in such daring air exploits, and her 1917 flight from San Diego to San Francisco set new benchmarks for both distance and time in the air. Stinson's flying career came to an abrupt end in about 1920, when she was diagnosed with tuberculosis."
84363,"A legendary hitter who set records that remain unequalled to this day, Hank Aaron was one of baseball's greatest offensive stars. Other players may have been more flamboyant, but none could match Aaron's power and consistency during his twenty-three years in the majors. After launching his career with the Negro League's Indianapolis Clowns in 1952, Aaron signed with the Milwaukee Braves and joined their roster in 1954. He soon emerged as a tremendous asset to that ball club, and in 1957 his bat drove the Braves to a World Series victory over the Yankees. In the years that followed, Aaron's impressive hitting fueled his assault on the record books, and in 1974 he became the first player to break Babe Ruth's career record of 714 home runs. When Aaron retired from play in 1976, his home run mark stood at 755."
84379,"President Eisenhower throws out the first pitch in the 1956 World Series between the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers    The Brooklyn Dodgers won game number one of the ""Subway Series"" at home in Ebbets Field. Yankees Mickey Mantle and Billy Martin and Dodgers Gil Hodges and Jackie Robinson all hit home runs.    Dwight Eisenhower, one of America's more athletic presidents, was on the football and baseball teams at West Point. Stories circulated that he had played professionally, but not until 1961 did the president acknowledge that he played semipro baseball under an assumed name a year before he entered West Point, most likely aware that it would have disqualified him from playing in college.   With the president are managers Casey Stengel and Walter Alston. On the president's left is baseball commissioner Ford Frick and behind him, partially visible, is Dodger owner Walter O'Malley.   "
84380,"Over his long, calculated, and prize-winning career as America’s best-loved poet, Robert Frost became the epitome of the New England Yankee: a weathered, craggy, flinty, and plainspoken countryman who turned ordinary life into poetry. Ironies abound. He was born in San Francisco and named after Robert E. Lee. Stereotyped as a regionalist, Frost received a major boost from the rootless modernist Ezra Pound. Uniquely American, Frost’s first two books were assembled and published in England before appearing in his homeland. Seemingly artless, because it is about artless subjects, Frost’s verse was a complicated formalist response to modernism—and to democracy. Frost did the most difficult thing: he made the complex weave of his poems appear easy or natural, leading to their persistent underestimation. Seemingly straightforward and reverential, his poems are sly, subversive. There was no less-traveled road in ""The Road Not Taken""; both paths are equally unworn, and the choice is false—or more terrifyingly, meaningless. As the years advanced, the Yankee persona won more often than not, and he tapped into a complacent, conservative populism, one that was not as benign or as avuncular as his audience sometimes assumed. Recovering that ""lost past’s / detail"" was Frost’s original task, one that cropped like granite through his most powerful work."
84382,"Evangelical Protestantism has been a major social and cultural, as well as religious, force in America, from the eighteenth century's Great Awakening to the present. The movement has been led by charismatic preachers, such as Henry Ward Beecher, Billy Sunday, and Billy Graham. Although they preached to huge crowds, their intention was always individual salvation. As Graham stated, ""My one purpose in life is to help people find a personal relationship with God, which, I believe comes through knowing Christ."" Graham made his own conversion at sixteen and became a traveling evangelist. He has become, through his ministry and worldwide crusades, a religious institution in his own right. His appeal is based on his charismatic stage presence and his espousal of an ""enlightened fundamentalism,"" one that retains the evangelical's passion without overpowering the message with emotion.  "
84393,"Jack Johnson was a world champion heavyweight boxer, nightclub owner, and automobile enthusiast who lived his life in defiance of Jim Crow segregation. White boxers avoided Johnson since they feared losing to a man of an ""inferior race,"" and he chased a few around the world to shame them into fighting him. His boxing style combined power, equipoise, and looseness: he stood in the center of the ring and taunted opponents as they tried to avoid his long reach. A charismatic man with extraordinary confidence, Johnson married three white women. A night owl and raconteur, he raced around in convertibles and often played classical cello at his Club Deluxe in Chicago. The legend that Johnson was refused passage on the Titanic is untrue, but it reveals the era’s racial realities. The need for a ""Great White Hope"" in boxing began with Johnson, and white boxers refused to fight blacks for a generation. In 1971 Miles Davis composed a soundtrack in his honor, A Tribute to Jack Johnson."
84394,"Brigham Young converted to Mormonism in 1832, and gradually rose in the leadership structure until he became the head of the ""Twelve Apostles"" under Joseph Smith. After Smith's murder by an anti-Mormon mob in 1844, Young assumed leadership of the larger portion of the church. In 1847 he led the Mormons from Nebraska to the Great Basin, where he founded Salt Lake City as the new church headquarters. He oversaw the migration of tens of thousands of Mormon converts to the West and the founding of hundreds of settlements. The Mormon majority elected Young as governor, but he was soon replaced by an appointed territorial governor. Political conflicts and challenges to the Mormons' separatist communal and theocratic venture led the United States to dispatch troops to Utah in 1857 and assert federal authority. Young was notorious for his many wives, a practice taught as a religious principle by his predecessor, Joseph Smith.      "
84401,"Born Cairo, Georgia  In 1947 Jackie Robinson transformed professional sports by becoming the first African American player in major league baseball. A trailblazer for equal opportunity, Robinson endured torrents of abuse in his first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Some of his own teammates mounted an abortive effort to have him dropped from the roster, while opponents and spectators alike taunted, heckled, and harassed him. Robinson steeled himself and responded with electrifying play that carried the Dodgers to a National League championship and earned him honors as Rookie of the Year. One of the top draws in baseball during ten memorable seasons of play, Robinson led the Dodgers to six pennants and one World Series title. He also paved the way for black major leaguers such as Willie Mays and Hank Aaron and remained a staunch advocate for civil rights after retiring from the game."
84404,"In 1861, Dorothea Dix was appointed superintendent of women nurses in Washington, D.C., a title she would hold without salary for the next five years. On the brink of sixty, dour in temperament, and disciplined in her work, Dix was totally dedicated to her task. The qualifications she set were harsh even by the standards of her day: ""All nurses are required to be plain looking women. Their dresses must be brown or black, with no bows, no curls, no jewelry, and no hoop-skirts."" And she would consider no woman under age thirty.  Dix worked throughout her life to improve conditions for the mentally ill. Her pioneering efforts established many institutions, such as St. Elizabeth's in Washington, D.C., the hospital that commissioned this portrait.  "
84405,"Born Oakland, California     Lillian Gilbreth had twelve children during the course of her marriage. That did not prevent her, however, from obtaining a doctorate in industrial psychology. Nor did it stop her from taking an active part in the consulting business started by her husband Frank, a pioneer in efficiency engineering. With Frank’s death in 1924, Lillian took over the business, and by the 1930s she was the country’s leading authority in applying workplace efficiency to home management. Among Gilbreth’s most lasting achievements were her efforts to devise ways for the physically handicapped to lead more independent lives.              Gilbreth posed for this portrait around 1930. Later her daughter Ernestine purchased the picture with royalties from Cheaper by the Dozen, the best-selling memoir that she and her brother had written about their life."
84407,"Lionel Hampton began his musical career as a drummer until Louis Armstrong encouraged him to take up the vibraphone in the early 1930s. Hampton introduced that instrument to the jazz idiom and came to the attention of Benny Goodman in 1936. When Goodman formed the Benny Goodman Quartet, Hampton played ""vibes"" and went on to direct the group's recordings of such favorites as ""Dinah"" and ""Exactly Like You."" In 1940 Goodman disbanded the quartet, and Hampton struck out on his own, incorporating such musicians as Charles Mingus, Quincy Jones, and Charlie Parker into the Lionel Hampton Orchestra. Among the top bands in the country, the orchestra played all the popular clubs, as well as Carnegie Hall and Harlem's Apollo Theatre. Hampton's high-energy spontaneity was legendary: ""We got no routine,"" he once said. ""We just act the way the spirit moves us."""
84409,"With a fastball that topped 100 miles per hour and an equally devastating curve, hurler Nolan Ryan bedeviled batters in both leagues over the course of twenty-seven years in the majors. Drafted by the Mets in 1965, Ryan helped the New York ball club to its first World Series championship in 1969, but was later traded to the California Angels after struggling with his control. The move agreed with Ryan. His earned run average dropped, his strikeout numbers soared, and he astonished the baseball world by pitching four no-hitters in three years (1973-75). Ryan went on to play nine seasons with the Houston Astros before rounding out his career with the Texas Rangers. By the time he retired in 1993, Ryan not only had a total of seven no-hitters to his credit but owned the all-time strikeout record with 5,714."
84420,"   Born Manila, the Philippines   By the 1950s the Air Force was no longer a subordinate arm to the U.S. Army and Navy but a full-fledged equal. This enhanced status reflected the importance of America’s long-distance striking capability and covert observation ability to Cold War military preparedness. Coupled with the space program, this was the golden age of aeronautic research and development. Ben Rich worked in Lockheed Aircraft’s legendary ""Skunk Works,"" the super-secret, most technologically advanced center for the development of supersonic and stealth aircraft. His family had left the Philippines just after Pearl Harbor, and Rich went through California’s university system, getting a master’s degree from UCLA in aeronautical engineering. He started at Lockheed in 1954 and supervised many of its advanced airplanes, including the high altitude SR-71 Blackbird spy plane. He was called the ""father of stealth"" for his design of the F-117 fighter, seen in the background."
84421,"The on-camera morphing of Fredric March's handsome face into his monstrous alter ego in the 1931 film Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was a technical innovation accomplished with ""expert cunning,"" according to one reviewer, through a series of gradual exposures. The Swedish poster for the film juxtaposes March's two faces, and the contrast is sharpened by red and black colors and stylish geometric lettering. Audiences were already familiar with Robert Louis Stevenson's chilling tale; the 1886 story had been adapted into a popular stage play and several silent film versions, including one starring John Barrymore. But director Rouben Mamoulian introduced a self-consciously Freudian notion of the duality of good and evil: ""We are treating Hyde as the 'bad half' of Dr. Jekyll,"" he noted; ""a separate personality, but not a separate person."" March won an Academy Award for his expert impersonation of those contrasting selves. "
84441,"Born Portland, Maine    Edgar Allen Poe invented the Gothic horror novel, but the macabre genius of Baltimore could never have imagined the popular success that would be achieved by Stephen King, the genre's foremost contemporary practitioner. King turned to writing out of college and scored an early hit with Carrie (1974), about an ostracized high school girl with telekinetic powers who wreaks revenge on her sneering classmates. Incredibly prolific (he writes under several pen names) and a master of narrative and suspense, King has sold more than 350 million copies of his books. Many, like Stanley Kubrick's version of The Shining (1977) have been turned into hit movies. In 1999 King suffered major injuries when hit by a car, and his torturous rehabilitation frustrated the author to the point that he announced in 2002 that he would stop writing. He has, however, resumed writing, an act that seems as essential to King's being as breathing.   "
84464,"Born Northampton, Massachusetts     Benjamin Tappan was a multifaceted, larger-than-life antebellum figure. Trained as a lawyer in New England, he soon moved west to Ohio. In 1838 he was elected to the Senate. His portrait was probably painted when Boston-based miniaturist Washington Blanchard was in Virginia in 1839; the image was engraved by 1840. Rectangular cases like this one, used for painted miniatures at this time, began to be utilized for daguerreotypes in the 1840s."
84486,"Pushed by an ambitious stage mother, singer-actress Judy Garland reached the pinnacle of Hollywood stardom in her late teens with her portrayal of Dorothy in The Wizard of Oz. An instinctive performer, she brought a vitality to her performances that gave her a large and dedicated following. Also fueling her celebrity was the chronic unhappiness of her personal life which, in juxtaposition with her enormous talent, ultimately turned her into a tragic legend.   Taken on the set of A Star Is Born-which one critic proclaimed ""just about the greatest one-woman show in modern movie history""-this photograph records Garland at both her best and her worst. On the one hand, she was in the midst of crafting one of the most memorable performances of her career. However, her tantrums and unreliability were rapidly escalating the film's costs to a near-record high in Hollywood. "
84497,"Born Richmond, Virginia  Known for such Oscar-winning films as Terms of Endearment as well as her current portrayal as Cora Crawley’s American mother in Downton Abbey, Shirley MacLaine actually began her versatile career as a dancer on stage and screen. She became a Broadway star at twenty when she replaced leading dancer Carol Haney in the 1954 Broadway hit The Pajama Game. Her magnetic personality soon attracted Hollywood, where her gamine quality made her a star in such films as Some Came Running, The Apartment, and Irma La Douce.   In this backstage photograph, MacLaine is captured on the set for the movie version of Cole Porter’s Can-Can, a film that critics acknowledge as her most effervescent dance performance. Her other dance films include The Turning Point with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Bob Fosse’s Sweet Charity, whose score contributed her signature song, “If My Friends Could See Me Now.”"
84513,"When New Orleans-born author Truman Capote published his notorious debut novel Other Voices, Other Rooms in 1948, the dust jacket photograph of him reclining on a couch helped establish his image as a frivolous, latter-day Oscar Wilde. Don Bachardy's arresting portrait challenges the stereotype, conveying more vulnerable aspects of the author's personality.  Bachardy never makes preliminary sketches for his large portrait drawings, preferring the pressure of having ""to get it right the first time."" His usual practice is to draw one eye and scale the rest of picture around it. Bachardy has found that such ""eye contact"" results in ""a real exchange of energy"" between two personalities at a particular moment. At the time Capote posed for Bachardy in 1964, he was finishing In Cold Blood, a ""nonfiction novel"" about the brutal murders of a Kansas family.  "
84522,"Equal passions for jazz and graphic design motivated artist Niklaus Troxler's innovative posters. Starting in the mid-1970s, he organized an annual music festival in his native Willisau, Switzerland, and his advertising images for those events established his reputation as a graphic artist. ""His success is linked to his profound understanding of the work he wants to describe,"" one admirer has observed. In this poster for a tribute concert to jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk, Troxler tried to visualize the composer's favorite composition, ""'Round Midnight."" Originally trained as a typographer, Troxler ultimately outlined Monk's recognizable, goateed profile with brightly colored lettering. Monk, who transformed jazz with discordant, bebop experimentation, was ""after new chords, new ways of syncopating, new figurations, new runs."" Troxler's unexpected compositions and dazzling color combinations pay tribute to Monk's legacy of improvisation."
84529,"Described in one obituary as a ""mischievous man,"" William Walker was intent on establishing an American colony in Latin America in the years before the Civil War. Having failed at medicine and law, Walker traveled to California in 1850, where he found work at a San Francisco newspaper. In 1853 he initiated his first ""filibustering"" expedition, leading a group of followers to Baja California and proclaiming it the Republic of Lower California. Mexican authorities were not pleased and promptly dispatched a force to drive out Walker. After escaping across the border, he was arrested by U.S. Army officials but was later acquitted in court. Many Americans at the time sympathized with Walker's goals, which emboldened him to organize a new colonizing expedition. On this occasion Walker chose Nicaragua. Once again, his venture failed, and he was ultimately executed by a firing squad in Honduras.  "
84545,"At the age of twenty-five, planter and merchant Carter Braxton took his place in the Virginia House of Burgesses, the third generation of his family to serve there. Although hardly a radical and married to the daughter of a Crown appointee, Braxton proved willing to follow Patrick Henry in resistance to the Stamp Act and in 1774 pledged to boycott English trade. Elected to the Second Continental Congress, Braxton opposed a hasty and complete break with England, but in the end he put his name to the Declaration of Independence, had his portrait painted, and went home.  "
84582,"A critic once said that Carmelita Maracci ought to ""rank among the great dancers of her time,"" and her pupil Agnes de Mille claimed that Maracci's ""dances were the most . . . powerfully devised solos"" she had ever seen. While there was much to admire in her exquisite blending of classical ballet and Spanish dance, Maracci had a high-strung temperament that made for chronic unreliability and led to a repeated squandering of chances to advance her reputation as a performer. She had a substantial impact as a teacher, however, and her students included such distinguished dance figures as Cynthia Gregory and Jerome Robbins.  This picture was probably taken as Maracci practiced in her studio by herself. Her appetite for honing her craft was unabating, and even after a grueling session with students, she was apt to go back to practicing alone for yet another hour or so. "
84590,"Duke Ellington called Billie Holiday ""the essence of cool,"" a reference to her equipoise in performance. The most influential jazz vocalist of all time, Holiday had a controlled emotional power that transformed even trite ballads into romantic short stories. Born Eleonora Harris and partially raised in a New York City brothel, she crafted a cool vocal style by tempering Bessie Smith’s shouting power with Louis Armstrong’s rhythmic nuance, then honed her craft on the road with the Count Basie Orchestra. Lester Young named her ""Lady Day,"" and in their chamber jazz classics, such as ""All of Me,"" voice and saxophone curl around each other into smoky swirls of late-night yearning. Late in life Holiday, a drug addict and survivor of abusive relationships, sang in a cracked, broken voice that remained true to the jazz practice of self-expression. "
84591,"Since the early 1950s, Odetta has been recognized as one of folk music's most compelling interpreters. Introduced to this musical genre just as the folk revival was gaining momentum, she wholeheartedly embraced the ballads, work songs, blues, and spirituals that so vividly evoked the experiences of generations of African Americans. Her powerful voice and distinctive guitar playing soon earned her an enthusiastic following that included performers Pete Seeger and Harry Belafonte, who helped to champion her career. The growth of the civil rights movement coincided with Odetta's rising popularity, and as her political engagement grew, her songs became weapons in the struggle for justice. ""As I was singing, I was one of those things that was smoldering,"" Odetta later recalled. In 1963 she joined the March on Washington and rallied the crowd with her moving rendition of the spiritual ""Oh Freedom."""
84617,"Film actor William S. Hart was the first internationally renowned star of the American western. During his childhood in Minnesota, South Dakota, Kansas, and Iowa, he grew up around Sioux children, learned to speak Lakota, and eventually worked on cattle ranches. Hart trained as a stage actor but turned in the mid-1910s to the western film genre, introducing a new, gritty reality to settings, cast, and costumes. A writer, director, and screenwriter as well as a compelling screen presence, he became one of the most successful leading men of the era. By the 1920s, Hart's popularity in America was fading. But the lean, gun-toting cowboy-complete with bandana, boots, and buckskins-in this Swedish poster for the film originally titled O'Malley of the Mounted, promised to deliver what European audiences expected from Hart: a moralistic frontier drama spiced with bucking broncos, wild steers, and ""the wild games of the cattle lands."""
84648,"Born Rockland, Maine  Poet Edna St. Vincent Millay personified the rebellious spirit of the 1920s, both in her work and in her bohemian lifestyle. After graduating from Vassar in 1917—the same year she published her first volume of verse—Millay became part of the artists’ community in New York’s Greenwich Village. In what is her most often-quoted quatrain, she summarized her existence there: ""My candle burns at both ends; / It will not last the night; / But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends / It gives a lovely light!"" Millay worked in traditional verse forms and took as her main theme the integrity of the individual spirit. In 1923, she was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for her Ballad of the Harp-Weaver.  This portrait by her friend William Zorach appeared in Century magazine shortly afterward, in June 1923, accompanying a laudatory article. "
84654,"   Born Boston, Massachusetts  John Jeffries established a medical practice in Boston around 1770, but his Loyalist sympathies led him to serve in the British army and, in 1779, to move his family to England. Falling in love with balloon flight, he financed two voyages for himself and Jean Pierre Blanchard in 1785. Jeffries wished to make scientific and meteorological observations on the flight, and purchased instruments for that purpose. His Narrative of the voyage, which was published in the spring of 1786, included this engraving with a barometer and text that details the dangers the aeronauts experienced before their successful landing in France. "
84671,"Stationed three times in China in the 1920s and 1930s, General Joe Stilwell knew the country's culture well and had thoroughly mastered its language. So, at the outbreak of World War II, he was a natural for his dual appointment as commander of American forces in China, Burma, and India and chief of staff to China's Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Stilwell's mission was to coordinate American forces and resources with China's army to drive Japan out of Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, Chiang Kai-shek felt that it was largely up to the Americans to accomplish that aim while he directed his own forces to protecting his regime against its internal rival, the Chinese Communists. As a result, Stilwell was constantly frustrated in his main purpose, and at Chiang Kai-shek's insistence in late 1944, he was removed from his post."
84674,"Born Beckwith (now Beckwourth), California  The top-ranked woman in U.S. tennis from 1936 to 1940, Alice Marble is credited with pioneering the aggressive and athletic style of play that is now standard in women’s tennis. Having excelled in various sports as a child, Marble took up tennis at the age of fifteen, learning the game on a public court in San Francisco. Formal coaching improved her technique and she quickly amassed victories in a string of junior championships before health problems forced her to abandon play for several seasons. When she returned to the courts in 1936, Marble won her first United States national championship and proceeded to dominate women’s amateur tennis for the next four years, winning three more U.S. singles titles (1938, 1939, and 1940) and the coveted Wimbledon crown (1939). She also captured numerous women’s doubles and mixed doubles championships before turning professional in 1940 and continuing play on the exhibition circuit."
84693,"George Washington's presidency coincided with the advent of a real printmaking industry in the United States. With the demand booming for both illustration and popular prints for framing, engravers could now enjoy a steady market. Washington's growing status as a national icon after the Revolutionary War spurred the fledgling industry to supply the demand for inexpensive portraits. Various engravings show Washington as a military commander, a noble citizen-who, like the Roman Cincinnatus, gave up his power to return to his farm-a statesman, and a heroic symbol of his country. Readily accessible pictures-printed portraits, cartoons, broadsides, photographs, posters, and eventually film-have played a role in presidential politics ever since.     Script #AP010, AP011, and AP012 (two labels)    [#2: Object label with curatorial for all three prints]  Interpreting the death of Washington    Americans responded to George Washington's death on December 14, 1799, with an outpouring of oratorical and pictorial tributes that encompassed various approaches to death, grief, and glorification. Enoch Gridley's engraving includes the traditional elements of fashionable neoclassical mourning art: portrait, urn, obelisk, and weeping figure of Columbia. Additional allegorical figures further exalt the ""father of his country,"" personifying, according to a published broadside, Fame, Wisdom, Liberty, and Truth. David Edwin's Apotheosis engraving implies a religious transformation as Washington ascends from his earthly home to be welcomed by heroes on high. The more secular deathbed scene, depicting Washington's physicians taking his pulse with the aid of a stopwatch, related to published accounts of his stoic final moments. Americans could buy the same image, along with a companion mourning picture, in the form of a printed handkerchief.  "
84706,"Born Los Angeles, California    Based on a publicity still from Marilyn Monroe's 1953 film Niagara, Andy Warhol's portrait of the film star conveys both her glamour and her fragility. A gifted performer, Monroe became an iconic sex symbol, entertaining troops in Korea and electrifying movie audiences. Despite her success, she maintained an air of vulnerability. Warhol capitalized on these contradictions, first portraying Monroe after her 1962 death from a drug overdose. Using silkscreens, he created multiple renditions of the portrait. By emphasizing the images' off-register printing, Warhol created a powerful metaphor for the dissolution of Monroe's career and the disastrous impact of her overexposure. In this screenprint, one of a series of ten, Monroe's sensual features dissolve into a nearly impenetrable mask as Warhol's non-naturalistic colors and their improper alignment add a jarring, alienating effect to the familiar face."

84737,"In the catalogue accompanying Jamie Wyeth's first one-man show in 1966, Lincoln Kirstein lauded the twenty-year-old artist as ""the finest American portrait-painter since the death of John Singer Sargent."" In Kirstein's eyes, the young Wyeth was both ""a master and a veteran,"" having received from his artistic family both native talent and rigorous training. Kirstein, nearly sixty when he sat for the portrait, had promoted the arts throughout his life as writer, scholar, poet, businessman, and founder-with choreographer George Balanchine-of several ballet companies. In preparation for painting Kirstein, Wyeth sketched him from both the front and the back. The chosen pose emphasizes Kirstein's massive frame. While giving an impression of monumentality, it is also a telling stance for an impresario who spent much of his time watching others in the creative process.  "
84752,"Born Newark, New Jersey  Along with Loie Fuller and Isadora Duncan, Ruth St. Denis created a theatrical and spiritual basis for modern American dance. She was discovered in 1898 by Broadway producer David Belasco when she was a “skirt dancer” in vaudeville, and joined his company as a featured dancer. Touring the world with Belasco, she became intrigued by Eastern philosophy and began forging ideas about using dance and melodrama to express a kind of mystical spirituality.  In 1906 she caused a sensation by performing a solo dance based on Hindu mythology: her exotic barefoot dance Rhada dazzled society matrons and launched her to fame. Subsequent national tours established her as a pioneer of the emerging modern dance movement.  From 1915 to 1929, she organized and ran the Denishawn School with Ted Shawn; the school was recognized as an important training ground for such key dancers as Martha Graham and Doris Humphrey."
84754,"Famed illustrator James Montgomery Flagg was a fixture of New York's smart set, and he often sketched from life the figures he encountered. In 1914 he published The Well-Knowns, a book of his celebrity portraits, which included this image of illustrator Rose O'Neill. Despite Flagg's acerbic streak, no one could achieve softer, more sensuous effects from charcoal and pencil, and this drawing suggests his strong admiration for O'Neill. Giving a jaunty tilt to her head, he implies independence and brilliance as well as beauty. In 1909 O'Neill had become a phenomenon for her impish little cupids, called ""kewpies,"" whose gestures she based on memories of a baby brother. They evolved into a marketing bonanza that lasted a quarter-century, generating the wildly popular kewpie dolls, as well as china, wallpaper, fabric, knickknacks, and even a Broadway musical."
84815,"The adopted grandson of vaudeville magnate E. F. Albee, Edward Albee was an indifferent student who dropped out of college. After trying his hand at writing poetry and novels, he turned to theater at Thornton Wilder's suggestion, and in three weeks composed a one-act play, The Zoo Story. Its New York premiere in 1960 established Albee as one of America's most promising young playwrights. Other one-acts, including The American Dream, followed, taking as their theme the struggle between real and artificial social values. His full-length play Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? earned him the Drama Critics Circle Award of 1962. Two later works, A Delicate Balance and Seascape, both won Pulitzer Prizes, and The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? won a Tony Award for Best Play in 2002. Albee sat for this likeness during a winter stay in Florida. "
84854,"Calder here portrays Ben Shahn as a person of tenacious resolve, ready to do battle for various political causes. The relationship between Calder and the social realist painter may seem highly improbable: while Shahn devoted his life and his art to liberal causes, Calder generally eschewed political issues in his art. However, along with his wife Louisa, Calder was deeply committed to liberal politics. With the rapid escalation of the Vietnam War in the 1960s, Calder and Shahn together advocated for an activist group called SANE (Sane Nuclear Policy), and both contributed posters and money for countless liberal and humanitarian organizations. As revealed through their lively correspondence, they also greatly enjoyed one another's company. "
84866,"“I learned about light from Beauford Delaney,” writer James Baldwin wrote about his mentor, remembering that the painter taught him how to see the world around him. Delaney, having moved to New York from Tennessee, began exhibiting street scenes and portraits of jazz musicians. But even in bohemian enclaves, the challenges of being gay, black, and perpetually impoverished caused endless struggle and depression. Settling eventually in Paris, Delaney moved toward an increasingly expressionist, abstract style. Intense light, often portrayed by brilliant hues of Van Gogh–inspired yellow, became a motif for abstractions and portraits alike.  The 1963 pastel of Baldwin is chromatically complex, the yellow darkened by harsh greens, violets, and reds. The image captures the emotional intensity of Baldwin and Delaney’s lifelong relationship. The portrait of Baldwin conflates the slender youth with the mature man, expressing the artist’s memories, anxiety, pain, and devotion over time."
84876,"Born Port Arthur, Texas  All-around athlete ""Babe"" Didrikson Zaharias freely admitted that she always ""had the urge to do things better than anyone else."" That intense competitive drive, combined with superb natural talent, made her one of the top athletes in American sports history. Named Mildred Didrikson at birth, she was later dubbed ""Babe"" by those who likened her baseball prowess to that of Babe Ruth. A basketball star in high school, Didrikson went on to excel at track and field, capturing first place in five events at the AAU Championships in 1932. At the Olympics that year, she took home two gold medals, with record-setting performances in the javelin throw and eighty-meter hurdles. Yet it was in golf that Didrikson left her most impressive mark. By the time she helped establish the Ladies Professional Golf Association in 1948, she had won forty-one amateur titles. She later claimed thirty-one more with the LPGA."

84884,"Born Hampden, Maine     In 1841, teacher, humanitarian, and reformer Dorothea Dix launched a vigorous campaign to secure humane treatment for the mentally ill. At a time when such individuals were more often imprisoned and abused than cared for and treated, Dix became a tireless advocate for their welfare. Traveling throughout the country to personally investigate the “cages, cellars, stalls, [and] pens” where sufferers were confined, she reported her findings in speeches and articles and in petitions she submitted to lawmakers. Thanks to her efforts, facilities for the care of the mentally ill were greatly expanded and improved."
84912,"Born Chicago, Illinois     When Gerald Ford became president on August 9, 1974, he said, “I am indebted to no man and only one woman, my dear wife, Betty.” An outspoken and inspirational first lady, Betty Ford unflinchingly embraced such hot-button issues as the Equal Rights Amendment and legalized abortion. Most important, she destigmatized attitudes about two illnesses that struck her during her very public life: as first lady, she talked openly about her battle with breast cancer; in 1982, after conquering her own addiction to alcohol and drugs, she founded the Betty Ford Center for substance abuse. Her post–White House life set a standard for future first ladies, and in 1991 President George H.W. Bush awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her continuing contribution to American life and culture.   "
84957,"David Hockney, who moved to Los Angeles from his native England in 1964, has long challenged traditional boundaries of artistic expression. As a young artist he abandoned abstraction in favor of figuration, identifying with the pop art movement. He has experimented with many artistic media and has described the Xerox machine, used here, as ""the closest I've ever come in printing to what it's like to paint: I can put something down, evaluate it, alter it, revise it, reexamine it, all in a matter of seconds."" Hockney's self-portrait reflects his admiration for cubism and Chinese scrolls. As he explained in reference to a painting from the same period: ""I was trying to create [an image] where the viewer's eye could be made to move in certain ways, stop in certain places, move on, and in so doing, reconstruct the space across time for itself."""
84985,"Marlon Brando embodied the rebel cool of the 1950s and defined the Method technique of acting. As Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire (1951), Brando created a complex portrait of working-class male sexuality that prompted the first rage for torn T-shirts and blue jeans. In The Wild One (1953), Brando adapted biker style into a charismatic bad-boy attitude that made him a poster boy for rebellion: ever since, leather jackets and motorcycles have been accessories of cool. In On the Waterfront (1954), he gave one of Hollywood’s greatest performances. James Dean worshipped him; Jack Kerouac wanted Brando to play Dean Moriarty in a film version of On the Road. As Don Corleone in The Godfather (1972), Brando reigned over a cast full of his theatrical sons, and his next film, Last Tango in Paris (1972) was a revealing, self-conscious meditation on his persona and the art of acting. Working sporadically for his last three decades, Brando was often sought out for advice by Johnny Depp, Sean Penn, and Edward Norton."
84987,"Born Vienna, Austria  Hattie Carnegie (born Henrietta Könengeiser) epitomized the immigrant experience by working her way from a job as a messenger at R. H. Macy’s to the pinnacle of the American fashion world. At first Carnegie built her business in New York by hiring young designers to create simplified versions of Paris fashions for elite customers. As the years passed and her fame grew, she expanded into ready-to-wear, accessories, and cosmetics. In 1941 she added a ""jeune fille"" department that not only catered to younger clients, but also to those who were on a budget. As fashion curator Richard Martin has noted, Carnegie ""captured the new spirit of democratic fashion by making high style available at a reasonable price."""
84990,"A talented singer and actress with beauty to match, Dorothy Dandridge possessed all the attributes of a star. Teamed with her sister, she made her stage debut as a child and later performed with the popular singing trio known as the Dandridge Sisters. In the 1940s she launched her solo career as a nightclub entertainer and began pursuing work in motion pictures. After appearances in several minor films, Dandridge scored a triumph when she was cast as the title character in Carmen Jones (1954). Critically acclaimed for her performance, Dandridge became the first black performer in history to be nominated for an Academy Award in a leading role. Despite this stellar beginning, Dandridge spent the remainder of her career trying to overcome the entrenched racial bias that doomed her to secondary roles rather than showcasing her ability as a dramatic actress.   "
84991,"Educated in the law at London's Inns of Court, John Rutledge of South Carolina had been on the national stage since the Stamp Act protests of 1765. Rutledge played a major role in the framing of the Constitution, but insisted that the Carolinas and Georgia would never be parties to a union that denied protection for their property in slaves.   Rutledge was appointed to succeed John Jay as chief justice of the United States, but his intemperate speech against the Jay Treaty with England, along with rumors of insanity, caused his rejection by the Senate.  "
84992,"Sammy Davis Jr. was a consummate showman whose formidable talent propelled him from the vaudeville circuit to the entertainment industry's most glittering venues. Scarcely more than a toddler when he began his career, Davis emerged as a featured singer and dancer with the Will Mastin Trio in the 1930s. Drafted during World War II, he experienced vicious racial attacks while in the army, and returned to civilian life determined to prove his worth by becoming a top-tier entertainer. Progressing rapidly from warm-up act to headliner, Davis attained bona fide stardom in the 1950s with his high-energy nightclub act, popular recordings, and acclaimed performances on stage and screen. In the 1960s he gained notoriety as a member of Hollywood's fast-living ""Rat Pack"" and subsequently achieved mega-hit status with his memorable renditions of songs such as ""Candy Man"" and ""Mr. Bojangles."" "
84995,"Combining talent, beauty, and steely determination, singer and actress Lena Horne challenged racial barriers to emerge as one of the most popular entertainers of her generation. Following her debut as a dancer at Harlem's Cotton Club, Horne found work as a big-band vocalist. Her subsequent success as a nightclub singer led to a Hollywood audition, and she became the first African American to secure a long-term contract when she signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in 1942. After starring in the all-black musicals Cabin in the Sky and Stormy Weather, Horne found her screen opportunities limited when she refused to accept stereotypical roles. Blacklisted during the McCarthy era, she succeeded in rebuilding her career and went on to take an active part in the civil rights movement. Horne's crowning achievement came in 1981, when her critically acclaimed one-woman show earned a special Tony Award.  "
84996,"Born Brooklyn, New York  Just twenty-two when she took Broadway by storm in the hit musical Funny Girl (1964), Barbra Streisand has retained her luster for more than four decades as one of the entertainment industry’s brightest stars. In tandem with her early success on the stage, Streisand rose to the top of the charts in the mid-1960s with such signature recordings as ""People"" and ""Don’t Rain on My Parade."" She took home the Academy Award for Best Actress in her motion picture debut in Funny Girl (1968). She continued her on-screen career in such films as Hello, Dolly (1969), The Way We Were (1973), and A Star is Born (1976) before branching into producing and directing with Yentl (1983) and The Prince of Tides (1991). The winner of dozens of awards throughout her career—including the 1977 Oscar for Best Original Song (""Evergreen"")—Streisand became a Kennedy Center Honors recipient in 2008."
85163,"On June 6, 1944, Allied forces began establishing beachheads on France's Normandy coast. As this huge operation progressed into the second day, it was clear that the defeat of Germany was now certain. In light of this success, Time magazine doubtless knew by mid-June that the invasion's orchestrator-in-chief, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, would be its 1944 Man of the Year. Indeed, it would not have been surprising if the magazine had ordered this likeness within days of the invasion. But Eisenhower's heading of this operation was not the only circumstance that earned him his Man of the Year designation: his singular combination of tact and intelligence made him one of the few individuals capable of mounting such a massive invasion.  "
85221,"Born New York City  Agnes de Mille was raised among screen legends. The niece of Hollywood founder Cecil B. DeMille and the daughter of William de Mille, a Broadway playwright who became a respected film director in the silent era, she was accustomed to movie stardom. But when she saw Anna Pavlova perform, she was so dazzled that she instantly decided to make dance her life.  She began as a choreographer in New York City in the 1920s and 1930s when, as she described it, “there were no rules.” Her breakthrough work, Rodeo, premiered in 1942 and did for dance, as she explained, what the Gershwins were doing in music. This triumph launched her long-term collaboration with Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein, beginning with their landmark 1943 musical Oklahoma! De Mille’s singular contribution—integrating dance into the musical’s narrative flow—established her as Broadway’s preeminent choreographer."
85270,"In this nation, I see tens of millions of its citizens . . . who at this very moment are denied the greater part of what the very lowest standards of living today call the necessities of life. . . . It is not in despair that I paint you that picture. I paint it for you in hope-because the Nation, seeing and understanding the injustice of it, proposes to paint it out. Thus Franklin Delano Roosevelt renewed his commitment to the New Deal policies he had established during his first term. New York Daily News photographers Harry Warnecke and Robert Cranston pictured Roosevelt-together with members of his family, his cabinet, and the Supreme Court-on the East Portico of the Capitol delivering his second inaugural address. The presidential seal has been draped in canvas to protect it from the cold rain that fell that day.  "
85276,"A celebrity-studded crowd thronged the opening of Andy Warhol and Jamie Wyeth's 1976 dual portrait exhibition, anxious to see how the ""Patriarch of Pop"" and the ""Prince of Realism"" would portray each other. Warhol's contribution included this monumental drawing, an image that subverts our expectations of both drawing and photography. Instead of sketching from life, Warhol traced the face from a projected photograph-the same one he used to create a series of glamorized paintings of Wyeth. However, the insistent zigzag lines fight against the handsome features, undermining any firm sense of contour and challenging the authenticity of the camera's eye. Brutally cropped across the scalp, Warhol's mammoth head of Wyeth accosts the viewer with an edginess that signals ambitious new directions for works on paper."
85410,"Born Saint Louis, Missouri     Josephine Baker took Paris by storm in 1925 when she appeared with the American troupe called La Revue Nègre. An innovative dancer, Baker developed a style that reflected a number of influences, from early black vaudeville to music hall and ballet. In Paris, she received instruction from some of the most important choreographers and dancers of the era. The famous dancer Serge Lifar described Baker as “the high priestess of an art which she has interpreted under the sign of Genius.” Artist Paul Colin, whose posters of Baker launched her career as well as his, made these studies. They relate to the images in his 1927 portfolio of lithographs, Le Tumulte Noir, which celebrated the rage for American jazz, the Charleston, and “La Baker.”  These colorful drawings show Baker dancing animatedly and reveal Colin’s early involvement in Baker’s career in Paris."

85416,"When Thomas Hart Benton drew W. C. Fields's portrait in 1937, the great comic was internationally renowned for his distinctive style and acerbic, irreverent tone. Fields had been gravely ill, however; he felt he had seen ""the fellow in the bright nightgown"" and was living on borrowed time. Benton's moving profile depicts a vulnerable, aging man, the human figure behind the famous antihero. On commission from Life magazine to produce a two-page spread about Hollywood, Benton made forty drawings of celebrities and their haunts, as well as anonymous workers in the film industry. Life rejected his final composite picture, publishing instead more glamorous photographic images of stars, mansions, and chorus girls. The artist was left with a cynical view of Hollywood, an opinion shared by Fields, who once commented, ""It's hard to tell where Hollywood ends and the DT's begin."""
85417,"Born near Germantown, Pennsylvania      A child prodigy who received no formal education, David Rittenhouse became one of early America’s most respected scientists and is depicted here as president of the American Philosophical Society. Rittenhouse made his living as a clock- and instrument-maker; his mathematical skills earned him service on commissions determining the boundaries of several states. Rittenhouse achieved international fame when he organized the Philosophical Society’s participation in an international effort to measure the transit of Venus. This allowed astronomers to more accurately measure distances to celestial objects. Rittenhouse’s published observations, along with those of other American scientists, attracted favorable reactions in Europe, bringing a new recognition of American scientific achievement.               Benjamin Franklin bequeathed a reflecting telescope made by James Short of London to Rittenhouse. The artist may have intended to reference that telescope in the portrait, but he did not provide enough details for a definitive identification.  In particular, he did not include the adjusting rod used to move the secondary mirror inside the tube of a telescope of this sort."
85418,"Son of the second president, to whom he owed his formidable intellectual training, John Quincy Adams was fated, like his father, to serve an undistinguished term as president (1828-32). Despite his long experience as an ambassador, senator, and secretary of state, Adams was unable to master the fractious sectional politics of the 1820s. The rigid and humorless New Englander was also out of step with the new popular political style pioneered by Andrew Jackson. Yet these so-called flaws contributed to Adams's success in his life's second act. Returning to Congress in 1831 (the only ex-president to take a lesser office after leaving the White House), Adams became known as ""Old Man Eloquent"" for his passionate opposition to slavery. In defending the African prisoners on the slave ship Amistad, he made the case in Congress that slavery was not just immoral but unconstitutional.  "
85443,"Playing with a steely determination that earned her the nickname ""Little Miss Poker Face,"" tennis great Helen Wills Moody became the first American woman to achieve international fame as an athlete. Only seventeen when she won her first American singles championship in 1923, Moody dominated women's tennis for more than a decade and elevated the sport to a new competitive level with her hard-hitting style of play. Between 1927 and 1933 she won 180 consecutive matches without dropping so much as a single set, and by the time she retired in 1938, Moody had collected thirty-one Grand Slam tennis titles."
85444,"Cheaper by the Dozen—The Gilbreth Family     Frank and Lillian Gilbreth and their twelve children were the topic of the popular book Cheaper by the Dozen (1948). The Gilbreths were both professional efficiency experts who studied time and motion to improve and simplify innumerable human functions, from manual labor to household chores. Naturally, their own home in Montclair, New Jersey, became a discovery lab for better and more economical ways of doing things, from washing dishes to raking leaves. Two Gilbreth children, Frank Jr. and Ernestine, wrote the lighthearted family memoir and took the title from a favorite saying of their father, who would explain his profuse progeny as cheaper by the dozen.  This painting by Andrew Loomis was commissioned for the January 1949 issue of Ladies’ Home Journal to illustrate excerpts from the new book."
85449,"Alger Hiss's conviction for perjury in 1950, arising from his denials to Congress that he had been a Communist spy, was a watershed event in the politics of the Cold War. The case offered up to Republicans a quintessential member of the liberal elite-Hiss was Phi Beta Kappa at Johns Hopkins, graduated from Harvard Law School, and served a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes-which lent support to their assertion that liberals had made common cause with Communism and the Soviet Union. Unlike the unsubstantiated charges of Senator Joseph McCarthy, the Hiss case moved many Democrats into the anti-Communist camp."
85538,"At various times the Meade Brothers operated daguerreian galleries in several locations simultaneously. After establishing their principal gallery at 233 Broadway in New York City in 1850, they opened another branch of their photography business on July 25, 1853. Identified by prominent signage, the new gallery occupied the upper portion of the Farmers’ and Citizens’ Bank located at the corner of First and South Seventh Streets in the city of Williamsburgh, New York—a community that became part of Brooklyn in 1855. The gallery’s tenure at this location was apparently brief, for no advertisements have been found for it after January 1854. "
85539,"Meade residence at 138 West 25th Street, New York City  In Trow’s New York City Directory for the twelve-month period ending May 1, 1857, entries for both Henry and Charles Meade listed their home address as 138 W. 25th Street. Charles had formerly resided in Greenpoint, Long Island, with his wife Marietta and their two children, but Marietta’s death in September 1855 may have prompted his move to the Manhattan home of his brother, Henry, and sister-in-law, Sarah. Their handsome brick and brownstone residence was located in the city’s Chelsea neighborhood, which experienced rapid growth in the 1840s and 1850s as New York City continued its northward expansion."
85541,"Bearing the initials ""M.M.""—for Meserole and Meade—on its uppermost layer, this elaborately decorated cake was created for the 1853 wedding of Sarah A. Meserole and Henry Meade. During this period, fashionable Americans favored tiered wedding cakes modeled after those produced for British royalty. Decorative motifs for such confections could include everything from frolicking cupids and allegorical figures to elaborate floral ornamentation. "
85542,"In December 1854, the Photographic and Fine Art Journal advised its readers that: ""<sc>THE MESSRS MEADE</sc> are preparing a block of marble for the Washington Monument, to contain the following inscription: ‘—<sc>TO WASHINGTON</sc>, An humble tribute from two disciples of Daguerre.’"" Documented in this daguerreotype, the brothers’ commemorative stone was destined for the monument to George Washington that was then under construction in the nation’s capital. When it was later installed within the obelisk’s interior, the Meade Brothers’ marble tribute joined nearly two hundred memorial stones presented by individuals, societies, cities, states, and foreign countries to honor Washington."
85544,"A patent for the first American photograph album was issued in May 1861, and manufacturers soon introduced a variety of albums designed to house the immensely popular cartes de visite. Intended to serve as a frontispiece to the Meade Brothers’ albums, this photograph reproduces one of Charles’s famous daguerreotypes of Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre, as well as Henry’s views of Daguerre’s chateau and tomb. It also features portraits of the brothers, their father Henry, and their sister Mary Ann."

85578,"Born Leeds County, Ontario, Canada  A Quaker and an abolitionist, Laura Smith Haviland played a critical role in organizing the first antislavery society in the Michigan Territory in 1834. After an epidemic claimed the lives of her husband, parents, sister, and youngest child in 1845, Haviland immersed herself in antislavery initiatives and performed missionary work among African Americans in both slave and free states. As an operative on the Underground Railroad, she made countless trips through Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan to aid fugitives on their perilous journey to freedom in Canada. During the Civil War, Haviland provided nursing care to wounded Union soldiers. She also served as an agent of the Michigan Freedmen’s Association (1864–66) and traveled widely throughout the South, giving much-needed assistance to the region’s newly emancipated slaves. In an effort to document slavery’s brutality, Haviland posed for this photograph holding the iron shackles she found on a Louisiana plantation."
85580,"Stokely Carmichael's first experience as a civil rights activist began in 1961, when he joined the Freedom Ride campaign to protest discrimination in public transportation facilities. Subsequent work in the South-to organize voter registration drives and to march against racist intimidation-resulted in Carmichael's frequent arrest. It also led him to question the philosophy of nonviolence. In 1966, Carmichael abandoned his association with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and helped to organize the Black Panthers, a group that promoted black separatism. His embrace of ""Black Power,"" a term that he coined, sparked outrage among many whites and alarmed an older generation of civil rights leaders. Gordon Parks's photograph shows Carmichael speaking in New York at a demonstration against the Vietnam War. As he exclaimed on this occasion, ""bigotry and death over here is no different from bigotry and death over there."""
85613,"On December 1, 1955, an African American seamstress named Rosa Parks took a seat on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. Local segregation laws required her to yield that seat should a white passenger want it, and when she refused to honor such a demand, she found herself arrested. It was a minor incident that might well have ended when she paid her ten-dollar fine. Instead, her act of defiance sparked a yearlong protest that forced the city to give up its racist practices in public transportation. More significant, however, Parks's action had ushered in a decade of agitation that would bring an end to much of the legalized racial discrimination in America.  Photographer Ida Berman took this picture in the summer of 1955, while Parks was attending a workshop in community activism at Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. "
85615,"Gordon Parks's photograph shows Malcolm X on a New York sidewalk selling a special issue of Muhammad Speaks, the official newspaper of the black separatist group Nation of Islam.

Jailed for burglary as a youth, the former Malcolm Little rose to a position of authority in the early 1960s as an outspoken critic of Martin Luther King Jr. and others who were, in his words, ""begging for integration."" ""We've shaken up the white man by asking for separation,"" he said in 1961. Although he would reject the Nation of Islam in 1964 and would reconcile his differences with King before being assassinated in 1965, Malcolm X was instrumental in making the campaign for civil rights more militant and in planting the seeds for the Black Power movement.  "
85626,"The energy and dynamism that Theodore Roosevelt brought to public life, in every stage of his reform career, made him one of the most written-about and caricatured people in the late nineteenth century.    This 1898 cartoon, published on the eve of Roosevelt's election as governor of New York, was an apt prediction of his ultimate destiny. President McKinley and his chief adviser, Mark Hanna, both proponents of such Republican Party doctrines as support for big business, did not share Roosevelt's spirit of independence and social reform; they stand on the balcony looking perplexed, and view Roosevelt's shadow encroaching upon the grounds of the White House with anxiety. Similarly, Thomas Platt, New York's powerful party boss and U.S. senator, warned, ""If he [Roosevelt] becomes Governor of New York, sooner or later, with his personality, he will have to be President of the United States.""    "
85651,"On September 14, 1901, Theodore Roosevelt became the third vice president to enter the White House after an assassination; President William McKinley had been shot and fatally wounded eight days before in Buffalo, New York. This issue of Harper's Weekly was devoted exclusively to McKinley's funeral and to biographical vignettes of the new president. Roosevelt, age forty-two, was the youngest man to take the oath of office. Nevertheless, his experience-in the New York State legislature, as U.S. Civil Service Commissioner, president of the New York City Police Commissioners, assistant secretary of the U.S. Navy, Rough Rider, and governor of New York-belied his age."
85652,"In this letter Volck wrote in 1900, he explained the motivations for his Confederate sketches. He noted that he worked at nights and in secret and attempted to be accurate in his depictions, based on what he saw and experienced, especially when he had the chance to travel in the South. In a letter Volck wrote to the Library of Congress five years later, he made a surprising admission: that his ""greatest regret ever was to have aimed ridicule at that great and good Lincoln—outside of that the pictures represent events as truthfully as my close connection with the South enabled me to get at them."""
85656,"Home of John C. Calhoun-slavery's arch-defender and architect of his state's doctrine for secession-South Carolina stood at the forefront, after Lincoln's election, in calling for southern separation from the Union. A week after the presidential polls closed, one of the state's residents likened its fevered political climate to that of the French Revolution. As the days passed, this spirit of rebellion only escalated. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina declared its independence from the North and urged its more hesitant southern sisters to do likewise.   This famous handbill was published by the Charleston Mercury to announce the state's historic decision."
85694,"Because of the limited space on ships, most émigrés during the first century of British settlement in America brought only the basic necessities. Chests such as this decorated example were used to store and transport goods on the transatlantic passage and, once in the New World, became reminders of their owners’ English heritage. Many industries, including furniture-making, soon grew up in the colonies, and artisans often modeled their work on English designs. "
85842,"Few American sportsmen have ever possessed athletic talents comparable to those of boxer Muhammad Ali; none with such abilities have ever equaled him for charisma and bravado. Born Cassius Clay, he first made national headlines after winning gold at the 1960 Olympics. Turning professional, he began his assault on the boxing ranks, attaining the heavyweight crown in 1964. But as powerful as he was in the ring, it was his words and actions outside the ring that made him a larger-than-life figure. His outrageous boasts-often in poetic verse-won him a large following. However, when he joined the Nation of Islam in 1964 and changed his name, controversy ensued. His refusal to serve in Vietnam further angered many Americans and led boxing officials to strip him of his crown. After being reinstated, Ali would reclaim the heavyweight crown, lose it, and regain it again before retiring in 1981."
85936,"Arturo Toscanini once said that Marian Anderson had a voice that came along ""once in a hundred years."" But because Anderson was black, her initial prospects as a concert singer in the United States were sharply limited, and her early triumphs took place mostly in European concert halls. Her successes abroad, however, made it difficult for the American musical establishment to ignore her, and when she began touring the United States in 1935, audiences quickly embraced her as the greatest contralto alive. By the time Anderson retired in the mid-1960s, she was regarded as one of the nation's great cultural treasures. Anderson is seen here performing with conductor Leonard Bernstein at a concert in Philadelphia in 1947. In response to the thunderous ovation for her performance, she ended up singing five more pieces as an encore."
85937,"When news photographer Margaret Bourke-White went to Philippe Halsman's studio in 1943 to have this likeness made, she specified that the image should have a sleek, glamorous edge to it. At the moment, however, her fame was resting on accomplishments that were decidedly more gritty than glamorous, namely her many coups in covering the fronts of World War II for Life. In June 1941, she had scooped her entire profession with her dramatic pictures of German air raids over Moscow. Then, when she was on her way to cover the African front, a German submarine torpedoed the ship she was on, and she found herself recording fellow passengers as they scrambled for survival. A few months later, Bourke-White became the first woman allowed to go on a combat flying mission."
85950,"When Elaine first saw President Kennedy in Palm Beach, he was talking to reporters in the distance. As she recalled, ""he was not the grey sculptural newspaper image. He was incandescent, golden. And bigger than life. Not that he was taller than the men standing around; he just seemed to be in a different dimension. Also not revealed by the newspaper image were his incredible eyes with large violet irises half veiled by the jutting bone beneath the eyebrows.""  For most of the portrait sessions, the president wore a starched white shirt, dress pants, and often a tie. This is how she has presented him here—seated, with his left arm pushing down on the arm of his chair, as though changing position. Through gestural strokes of paint she has captured something of the golden glow and green freshness of the Florida coast as well as the vibrant energy of her subject. By leaving much of the painting unresolved (although she considered it to be finished), she allows us to see him as she did, ""not a portrait of John F. Kennedy, but a glimpse.""    Cuando Elaine vio al presidente Kennedy en Palm Beach por primera vez, él estaba a cierta distancia, hablando con varios reporteros. Según su recuerdo, “no era la imagen gris y estática de los periódicos. Su figura era incandescente, dorada... y colosal. No es que fuera más alto que los hombres que lo rodeaban, pero parecía estar en otra dimensión. Los periódicos tampoco revelaban sus ojos maravillosos, sus grandes iris color violeta medio velados por el hueso saliente bajo las cejas”.  En la mayoría de las sesiones, el presidente vestía camisa blanca almidonada, pantalones de vestir y a menudo corbata. Así lo vemos aquí, sentado con el brazo izquierdo apoyado en el brazo del asiento, como si fuera a cambiar de posición. Las pinceladas gestuales captan la esencia de la luz dorada y el verde frescor de la costa floridense, y también la vibrante energía del personaje. Dejando gran parte del cuadro sin resolver (aunque ella lo consideraba terminado), Elaine nos permite verlo tal como ella lo veía: “no un retrato, sino un atisbo de John F. Kennedy”.   "
86178,"Autographed commentary about Grant and His Generals  Ole Peter Hansen Balling’s completed masterpiece Grant and His Generals was exhibited in New York City in 1866. Three generals in the painting—Ulysses S. Grant, George G. Meade, and George A. Custer—signed a book of commentary that accompanied the exhibition. Custer wrote, “I cannot find terms sufficiently strong to express my admiration for Mr. Balling’s war picture. The likenesses are accurate and lifelike, the positions well chosen. Certainly nothing of this kind has been produced which compares with it in excellence.”"
86179,"Balling’s pass from Abraham Lincoln  In preparation for his large equestrian painting of Union generals, Ole Peter Hansen Balling needed official access to Grant’s headquarters. This pass, written and signed by President Abraham Lincoln, is dated September 23, 1864, and authorizes “the bearer, Mr. H. Balling to pass to Gen. Grant, to whom he is hereby introduced.” "

86398,"In 1936, when John Steuart Curry drew this portrait, historian Van Wyck Brooks had just received a Pulitzer Prize for The Flowering of New England, one of several studies of the American tradition. In his many books, Brooks worried about the divergence between imported ""highbrow"" and vulgar ""lowbrow"" elements of contemporary life and advocated an indigenous national culture based on a ""usable past."" Curry, a Kansas-born artist renowned as a regionalist painter, distills the writer's pensive character with a furrowed brow and thoughtful expression. Both Brooks and Curry lived in the intellectual community of Westport, Connecticut. Although he had studied in Paris and lived for many years in the eastern United States, Curry, perhaps influenced by Brooks, focused on midwestern themes. ""My sole interest and conception of subject matter,"" he claimed, ""deals with American life, its spirit and its actualities.""  "
86509,"Born Northampton, Massachusetts  A lawyer by training, Benjamin Tappan (1773–1857) moved beyond private practice to fashion a high-profile career as a jurist and public officeholder during the antebellum period. In 1799 Tappan settled in Ohio, where he established a law practice and won election to the state senate (1803). After service in the War of 1812, he was appointed to a circuit court judgeship and later rose to prominence as a political operative for the Jacksonian Democrats. Elected to the U.S. Senate in 1838, Tappan crafted the 1844 bill that laid the foundation for the 1846 legislation establishing the Smithsonian Institution."
86559,"Forty-second President, 1993-2001    President Bill Clinton's 1996 reelection victory over former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole may have seemed almost a foregone conclusion at the time, especially considering Clinton's personal popularity and his ideological migration toward the political center. Yet the election proved to be significant in several ways: not since 1936 had a Democratic president won reelection, and for the first time since 1930 a Republican Congress was reelected. Moreover, not in the nation's history had a Democrat been voted into the White House while the opposition party controlled Congress. The American people, in Time's view, were clearly voicing their mandate for checks and balances and bipartisanship in Washington. Not even a watchdog Congress, however, could have anticipated the drastic measures it would take when the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal suddenly came to light. The House of Representatives impeached Clinton for perjury and obstruction of justice, only to have the Senate vote for acquittal.    Time cover, November 18, 1996"
86561,"Born Metairie, Louisiana    Despite its reputation for progressive politics, Hollywood has been surprisingly skittish when it comes to publicly acknowledging sexual difference. Thus it was a landmark event when in April 1997, comedian Ellen DeGeneres told Time magazine, ""Yep I'm Gay."" DeGeneres went on to say that she was ambivalent about coming out, feeling that there should be a zone of privacy allowable to public figures and celebrities. But she also felt that not openly acknowledging her lesbianism meant that she lacked control over her own life and career. Coming out, she said afterward, ""has been the most freeing experience because people can't hurt me anymore."" Social issues aside, DeGeneres is one of America's most successful show business figures: star of her own sitcom and talk shows and host of the Oscars and other awards shows, she continues to perform as she began-as a stand-up comedian. "
86566,"Toni Morrison has been writing about the experiences of African Americans since her first novel, The Bluest Eye, appeared in 1970. With the publication of each new work, both her fan base and critical acclaim grew, and she won the prestigious National Book Critics Circle Award for Song of Solomon (1977) and the Pulitzer Prize for Beloved (1987). In 1993 Morrison won the Nobel Prize for Literature, becoming the first black woman to become a Nobel laureate.  This photograph by Deborah Feingold appeared on Time magazine's cover on January 19, 1998, in recognition of the publication of Morrison's seventh novel, Paradise, whose success may also be measured by its tremendous first printing of 400,000 copies."
86568,"Born Brooklyn, New York    Nothing in contemporary America matches the impact of a megahit television program as it works its way into the habits and vocabulary of the audience. The impact is not simply demographic or economic, but truly cultural, as a program influences the vocabulary and style of its fans. Such a phenomena was Seinfeld, which ran on NBC from 1989 to 1998 and introduced America to the situation comedy of four friends just trying to get by-usually unsuccessfully-in modern-day Manhattan. Playing the deadpan ringmaster of Elaine, George, and Kramer's misguided antics was Jerry Seinfeld, a stand-up comedian whose observational humor about the absurdities of modern behavior was perfect for Seinfeld's satire of yuppie Americans. Sharp and acerbically written, the show contained catch-phrases (""Yadda, yadda, yadda,"" ""master of your domain"") that soon became commonplace. In various polls, Seinfeld is considered one of the greatest television programs of all time.  "
86608,"In an article for Godey's Lady's Book published in the spring of 1849, novelist and short-story writer Timothy S. Arthur described the enormous popularity of daguerreian portraiture in America by noting, ""In our great cities, a Daguerreotypist is to be found in almost every square; and there is scarcely a county in any state that has not one or more of these industrious individuals busy at work.""  Created to illustrate the Godey's article, this wood engraving depicts a scene in Marcus A. Root's daguerreian gallery in Philadelphia. As Root readies the camera, his assistant-most likely his brother, Samuel-adjusts the headrest to stabilize the apprehensive sitter during the several seconds needed to capture his daguerreotype likeness.  "
86638,"The greatest story Jack London ever wrote was the story he lived, wrote the literary critic Alfred Kazin. Destitute as a young man in San Francisco, London was forced to work a grueling factory job to make ends meet. He was jailed for vagrancy at age eighteen, an experience that compelled him to turn his life around. London had long wanted to become a writer, but it was not until the publication of The Call of the Wild in 1903-based on his experience in Alaska during the 1897 Klondike Gold Rush-that he began to achieve wide acclaim. In this and other writings, he presented the wilderness as a cold, often savage place. A prolific author and one-time member of the Socialist Labor Party, London had become a self-made millionaire by the time of his death at age forty."
86662,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Hailed as the ""Girl Orator"" by radical reformer William Lloyd Garrison, Anna Elizabeth Dickinson was still in her teens when she launched her public-speaking career. An ardent abolitionist and women’s rights advocate, Dickinson first found receptive audiences in Philadelphia, where she spoke before the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society (1860) and later delivered an address on ""The Rights and Wrongs of Women"" (1861). On the lecture circuit, Dickinson built a following among listeners captivated by her intensity, youth, and dedication to reform. She campaigned effectively for Republican candidates, and in 1863 she joined Frederick Douglass in promoting African American enlistment in the Union army."
86663,"Nicknamed ""Old Blood and Guts,"" General George Patton Jr. had a penchant for harsh, bluntly spoken opinions that sometimes made him the object of controversy during World War II. There was, however, no debating his soldiering abilities. In the Allied drive against Axis armies in North Africa, his gift for instilling frontline discipline was critical in shaping unseasoned American soldiers into effective fighting units. His leadership proved crucial again in the invasion of Sicily, but his finest moment came during the massive German counteroffensive in northern Europe's Ardennes region in 1944-45. His part in repelling the Germans there placed beyond challenge his reputation as one of the most brilliant field commanders of the war.  The inExhibition scription in the portrait's upper left corner was from Patton's declaration of May 9, 1945, telling his soldiers what an honor it had been to lead them.  "
86741,"Following his older brothers into law enforcement, Robert Dalton became a deputy U.S. marshal in the so-called Indian Territory in 1889, the year this portrait is thought to have been taken. However, after a dispute with his superiors, Dalton left this job and entered into a brief yet memorable career as a bank and train robber. He teamed with several brothers, first striking targets in California before returning to the southern plains. The ""Dalton Gang"" made national headlines for their audacious, often violent crimes and were frequently compared to the earlier band of outlaws led by Jesse and Frank James. Dalton's life as a desperado did not last long. In 1892, he and three other gang members were gunned down by citizens of Coffeyville, Kansas, during a daring double bank robbery. Dalton was twenty-three years old."
86748,"Born Taliaferro County, Georgia  Alexander H. Stephens was a powerful advocate for southern interests throughout his tenure in Congress (1843–59). Both a Unionist and a steadfast defender of slavery, Stephens endorsed the Compromise of 1850 and was instrumental in winning approval of the Kansas–Nebraska Act. When the Democratic Party split during the 1860 presidential campaign, he supported Stephen Douglas rather than fellow southerner John C. Breckinridge. In the wake of Abraham Lincoln’s victory, Stephens counseled against a headlong rush toward secession. However, when delegates from the southern states convened in Montgomery, Alabama, in February 1861 to form the Confederacy, Stephens accepted its vice presidency."
86749,"Born Cairo, Georgia    As the first African American to play major league baseball, Jackie Robinson was a pioneer in professional sports. This 1947 photograph by Harry Warnecke pictures Robinson at Ebbets Field during his first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers. That year was both glorious and unnerving. While winning Rookie of the Year honors and helping the Dodgers to win the National League pennant, Robinson faced intense scrutiny. As he later recalled, ""I had to fight hard against loneliness, abuse, and the knowledge that any mistake I made would be magnified because I was the only black man out there."" A lifetime .311 hitter, Robinson led the Dodgers to six pennants and one World Series title during his ten-year career. After baseball, Robinson continued to champion the cause of civil rights, serving as the chairman of the NAACP Fight for Freedom Fund.  "
86750,"Al Capone, called ""Scarface,"" was the most notorious gangster of the 1920s. He  was a bootlegger in Chicago, a city whose violent ""beer wars"" during Prohibition made it the symbol of organized crime in America. Capone's flamboyance-custom-made suits, expensive cigars, bodyguards, and armor-plated Cadillac-along with his dominating personality and violent temper, made him a leader among the city's gangsters and played to the public fascination with crime figures. Capone's men perpetrated the famous St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. He attracted considerable press and the attention of President Herbert Hoover, who instructed federal agents to put him in jail. This photograph was taken by the New York police after Capone was apprehended in connection with a shooting. An arrest for carrying a concealed weapon, followed by a conviction for income tax evasion, brought his criminal career to an end at the age of thirty-two.  "
86753,"Greta Garbo was the biggest star at MGM Studios during the late silent–early sound era, when American movie attendance was at its all-time high. Her success lay in an angular, flawless beauty and a performance style rooted in subtly expressive eyes set against an otherwise enigmatic countenance. Garbo was nicknamed the ""Swedish Sphinx"" for conveying a coolness that has been variously described as alluring, indifferent, melancholy, and aloof. The filmmaker Billy Wilder explained, ""Her face . . . has such uniqueness, such luminosity that . . . you read into it what you like."" Garbo signed a contract with MGM in Sweden but was seemingly forgotten when she arrived in New York City. She planned to return home until company president Louis B. Mayer saw this and other portraits taken by Arnold Genthe that captured her photogenic mystique. Within days Garbo was bound for Hollywood. In retirement she became the most famous recluse in America."
86755,"Boxer Jimmy Carter (in the light-colored trunks) was the first three-time winner of the world lightweight title. After turning professional in 1946, Carter gradually worked his way up boxing's ranks until he earned the chance to challenge then-champion Ike Williams on May 25, 1951. Although Williams was heavily favored, Carter scored a stunning upset to take his first lightweight boxing championship. Retaining the title would prove more difficult, however. Over the next four years Carter would twice lose and then regain his boxing crown before surrendering it for the final time in 1955. One of Carter's successful lightweight title defenses took place in a nationally televised bout with twenty-two-year-old George Araujo on June 12, 1953. Although the boxers were evenly rated, the hard-hitting Carter prevailed over his fleet-footed challenger to win by a technical knockout in the thirteenth round."
86820,"Here’s how Life magazine described Gary Cooper in 1952, after he won his second Oscar for his performance in the western thriller High Noon: ""Doesn’t have to say a word. Doesn’t even have to smile. One look at Gary Cooper and the weak take heart, the villains take cover, and the women faint."" Starting in the movies as a stunt man who excelled at falling off horses, he emerged in the 1930s as Hollywood’s leading man. In films such as The Virginian (1929) and Sergeant York (1942), Cooper often played the strong, silent hero who brings order and justice where lawlessness had previously reigned. A hunting buddy of Ernest Hemingway, he also starred in A Farewell to Arms (1932) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1943), two movies adapted from Hemingway novels. As Cooper’s fame increased, he embraced his on-screen taciturnity in his private life as a defense against intrusions. "
86821,"Anna May Wong was the first Chinese American actress to become a major box-office attraction. After scoring a success as the exotic Mongol slave in The Thief of Bagdad (1924), Wong was immediately pegged as Hollywood’s ""oriental siren."" Relegated to minor parts in a series of movies featuring unsympathetic portrayals of Asian characters, she left Hollywood for Europe in 1928, where she received leading film and stage roles. She returned to the United States in 1930 to star in the Broadway play On the Spot. Although Wong appeared regularly on screen throughout the 1930s, the U.S. film industry never gave her the opportunity to move beyond stereotypical roles. As a consequence, Wong often found herself in the unenviable position of performing in films that perpetuated racial stereotypes or not working at all."
86822,"Born Salisbury, New Hampshire  In a period when American federalism faced increasing challenges from states’-rights supporters, Daniel Webster emerged as one of the Union’s most eloquent defenders. Having gained acclaim as a lawyer who argued some of the young republic’s pivotal Supreme Court cases, Webster became a major force in national politics through his service in the House of Representatives and the Senate. There, his brilliant orations on behalf of the indivisibility of the Union marked him as one of the greatest public figures of his generation. The evergreen sprig preserved with this daguerreotype serves as a reminder of Webster’s endurance as a symbol and an icon in American history."
86823,"Born Newburyport, Massachusetts  Founder (1831) and editor of the antislavery newspaper The Liberator, William Lloyd Garrison was an ardent abolitionist who believed that appeals to the nation’s conscience could succeed in convincing Americans of the evils of slavery and thus bring about its destruction. Rejecting calls for gradual emancipation, Garrison demanded immediate abolition and was unrelenting in his determination to expose the brutality inherent in the South’s “peculiar institution.” Despite his vehement denunciations of slavery’s enablers and defenders, Garrison remained steadfast in his commitment to nonviolent action and moral suasion as the only legitimate means to achieve the goal of universal emancipation."
86825,"In 1954, when Ernest Hemingway received the Nobel Prize in Literature, the committee cited his “mastery of the art of modern narration.” In fact, through his short stories and such novels as The Sun Also Rises (1926) and For Whom the Bell Tolls (1940), Hemingway had, with his terse, powerful prose, in large measure invented a new literary style as he chronicled the disillusionment of the post–World War I “lost generation.” Hemingway’s own experiences—reporting foreign wars, living the bohemian life in Paris, and adventuring in Africa, Spain, and Cuba—fueled his imagination and helped foster his larger-than-life public persona.  When Karsh traveled to Cuba in 1957 to photograph Hemingway, he “expected to meet in the author a composite of the heroes of his novels.” Instead, the photographer recalled, “I found a man of peculiar gentleness, the shyest man I ever photographed—a man cruelly battered by life but seemingly invincible.”"
86827,"When physicist Rosalyn Yalow took a job in 1947 at the Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital to explore the potential of radioisotopes in diagnosing and treating illnesses, her first lab was a converted janitor’s closet, and she had to improvise some of her equipment. From that unpromising beginning came pathbreaking results. By the early 1950s, she was working in partnership with Dr. Solomon Berson, and out of their investigations came RIA (radioimmunoassay), a procedure that proved invaluable in diagnosing and determining treatment for a wide range of diseases. In recognition of that achievement, Yalow became the first woman to win the prestigious Albert Lasker Prize for Basic Medical Research in 1976, and a year later she was awarded the Nobel Prize in medicine.  Yalow’s portrait was part of series of images by photographer Arthur Leipzig depicting Jewish women—both famous and anonymous—from around the world. "
86838,"Born New York City  The multi-talented Clare Boothe Luce first gained notice as the witty editor at Vanity Fair magazine who reveled in the latest cultural trends but was also among the first to skewer them. Married to publishing mogul Henry Luce in 1935, she never held an official position in her husband’s enterprises, but she influenced them nonetheless—most memorably when she helped persuade Luce to launch the spectacularly successful Life magazine in 1936. She also distinguished herself as a playwright. Her acerbic comedy The Women—featuring an all-female cast—was one of the great Broadway hits of the 1930s. Luce next turned her attention to politics. After campaigning for Republican presidential candidate Wendell Willkie in 1940, she won election to Congress in 1942, where she served two terms. When President Dwight Eisenhower named her ambassador to Italy in 1953, a Gallup poll ranked Luce among the world’s most admired women."
86839,"Fred Astaire 1899–1987  Born Omaha, Nebraska  Ginger Rogers 1911–1995  Born Independence, Missouri  Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers first appeared onscreen in Flying Down to Rio (1933). Their performance of “The Carioca” generated such an enthusiastic response that RKO quickly cast them in what became a historic movie series—The Gay Divorcee (1934), Roberta (1935), Top Hat (1935), Follow the Fleet (1936), Swing Time (1936), Shall We Dance (1937), Carefree (1938), and The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939). For MGM, they teamed once again for The Barkleys of Broadway (1949).  Astaire and Rogers brought glamour and a stylized elegance to Depression-era audiences. He worked on the main choreography, with Rogers coming in to “button-hook” the work at the end. A classic “Frank and Ernest” cartoon by Bob Thaves declared, “Sure he [Astaire] was great, but don’t forget that Ginger Rogers did everything he did, backwards . . . and in high heels.”  This photograph shows the “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” number at the end of Follow the Fleet."
86840,"Born Springfield, Missouri    In 1966 Human Sexual Response-a clinical study co-authored by practicing gynecologist Dr. William Masters and his research partner Virginia Johnson-became a surprise bestseller that catapulted its authors into the national spotlight. The product of more than a decade of laboratory study involving hundreds of subjects, Masters and Johnson's investigation moved beyond the pioneering work begun by sex researcher Alfred Kinsey in the late 1930s to focus on human sexual function and dysfunction with the aid of modern medical technology. While some accused the pair of fostering a new age of sexual permissiveness with Human Sexual Response and their subsequent volume Human Sexual Inadequacy (1970), Masters countered that ""the pendulum is swinging now toward sexual interest because we are throwing off our cultural repressions."" Their goal, he maintained, was merely to provide ""a hopeful approach"" to couples ""in need of marital guidance."""
86841,"Seated at the center in this group portrait is William Butler Ogden, the first mayor of Chicago and later the first president of the Union Pacific Railroad. Arriving in Chicago in 1835, Ogden was skeptical about the new town's future. Yet he soon came to believe that Chicago was well situated to grow into the industrial and transportation hub of the Midwest. Achieving this goal required significant investment in the regional infrastructure, and Ogden was aggressive in helping to build roads, railways, canals, and bridges. Having made a fortune in real estate, he invested in various new businesses and inventions, including Cyrus McCormick's reaper-a piece of machinery that would revolutionize agricultural production in the Midwest and on the plains. Given his experience with railroads, his political connections, and his enthusiasm for a transcontinental line, Ogden was named the first head of the Union Pacific after its incorporation in 1862."
86854,"Born Barnstable, Massachusetts    As chief justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Court from 1830 to 1860, Lemuel Shaw ruled on a wide range of issues. His greatest impact, however, was in the field of laws affecting business and industry, where his decisions influenced commercial law interpretation in courts throughout the nation. Shaw also passed judgment in several key cases concerning the fate of fugitive slaves. Although personally opposed to slavery, Shaw believed that it was “too deeply interwoven in the texture of society to be wholly or speedily eradicated.” In 1851 he issued an opinion supporting the constitutionality of the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. "
86855,"After an early career writing pulp fiction and several failed idealistic novels, Upton Sinclair became a socialist and published The Jungle-one of the most influential novels of its day-in 1906, the year this photograph was taken. Intending to expose corruption and wretched conditions for workers, Sinclair had spent seven weeks living in Chicago's meatpacking district.

The book, an international sensation, prompted Theodore Roosevelt to invite Sinclair to the White House; the president signed the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act shortly afterward. Motivated by his concern for social justice, Sinclair continued to write historical novels and exposés, becoming one of the Progressive Era's best-known muckrakers.    This photograph was taken at Sinclair's small farm near Princeton, New Jersey, in 1906, the year he ran for Congress as a socialist."
86856,"After an early career writing pulp fiction, Upton Sinclair published The Jungle-one of the most influential novels of its day-in 1906, the same year this photograph was taken at his modest New Jersey farm. Intending to expose corruption and wretched conditions for workers, Sinclair had spent seven weeks living in Chicago's meatpacking district. But The Jungle also revealed the appalling sanitary conditions of the industry. ""I aimed at the public's heart,"" he later recalled, ""and by accident I hit it in the stomach."" The book, an international sensation, prompted Theodore Roosevelt to invite Sinclair to the White House; the president signed the Pure Food and Drug Act and the Meat Inspection Act shortly afterward.

86857,"Standing in the top row, sixth from the left, with a long beard and thinning hair, is George M. Wheeler, the West Point graduate who in 1871 developed a comprehensive plan for surveying the territory west of the hundredth meridian. For the next eight years Wheeler led a group of soldiers and civilians that surveyed nearly 360,000 square miles, roughly one-third of the mountainous West. The Wheeler Survey accumulated a vast quantity of information regarding the region's geology, botany, and ethnology. Most significantly, they published maps-164 in all-that covered nearly all the land through which the survey party had traveled. The creation of the U.S. Geological Survey in 1879 effectively ended Wheeler's work in the West. This photograph, taken outside Wheeler's Washington, D.C., office, depicts many of the men who served with him. The photographer Timothy O'Sullivan-who accompanied Wheeler for three seasons-stands in the bottom row at the left."
86883,"Born Schenectady, New York  Gambling that it could attract viewers to an early morning television program offering breaking news as well as entertainment features, NBC launched the Today show on January 14, 1952. The first network program of its kind, Today succeeded in developing a loyal following thanks in large measure to the skills of Dave Garroway, the show’s original host and morning television’s “founding father.” With his affable, low-key demeanor and his ability to connect with the viewing audience, Garroway was the ideal choice to “wake America . . . and send it off to work.” As one critic observed, “He does not crash into the home with the false jollity and thunderous witticisms of a backslapper. He is pleasant, serious, scholarly looking and not obtrusively convivial.” Garroway even retained his good humor when NBC added a chimpanzee named J. Fredd Muggs to Today’s roster as a ploy to appeal to younger viewers."
86897,"Born Shanghai, China  Tsung-Dao Lee first met fellow physicist Chen Ning Yang in their native China, but it was while studying under Edward Teller and Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago in the late 1940s that the two became close friends. After earning their doctorates, Lee and Yang were reunited in 1951 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where they began their collaborative study of K-mesons—the recently discovered unstable particles that resulted from high-energy bombardment of atomic nuclei. Their groundbreaking investigation of the unusual decay patterns exhibited by these subatomic particles led to findings that disproved a long-accepted principal in theoretical physics. That principle, known as conservation of parity, had held that particle interactions and the mirror image of such reactions obeyed the same physical laws and were indistinguishable from each other. Lee and Yang’s research led to important discoveries regarding elementary particles and earned the duo a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1957."
86904,"In the 1926 edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica, Henry Ford coined the term ""mass production"" to characterize the manufacture of the Model T automobile. Ford's efficiency in producing the car had reduced its price from around $900 in 1908 to $290 by 1927, when the last of fifteen million units rolled off the assembly line. In 1914, Ford had doubled industrial workers' pay rate and shortened their workday by two hours, but his benevolent paternalism had its dark side. He bitterly opposed labor unions and was notorious for spying on his workers, even intruding into their personal lives. Ford's later anti-Semitism proved to be the major stain on a man who many believed could have been president of the United States.  This 1910 orotone of Ford, printed on glass tinted with metallic powder and oil or resin, was a photographic innovation at the time.  "
86905,"Harry Belafonte created a sensation in the 1950s when he introduced Americans to the lilting Caribbean rhythms of calypso with his renditions of such songs as ""Day-O (Banana Boat Song)."" Although trained as an actor, Belafonte achieved his first success in 1949 as a pop music singer before shifting his focus to the American folk songs and traditional West Indian melodies that showcased his talent as a balladeer and reflected his strong social conscience. In 1956 his release of Calypso-the first album to sell more than one million copies-launched the craze for this musical genre and established Belafonte as its most popular interpreter. Believing that his music could help bring people together to work for the common good, Belafonte embraced the dual roles of civil rights activist and humanitarian early in his career, and has continued to advocate for those in need."
86906,"Born Santa Monica, California  The winner of the U.S. women’s indoor singles tennis title in March 1949, Gertrude ""Gussie"" Moran was promptly dubbed ""Gorgeous Gussie"" by sportswriters, who seemed more eager to extol her good looks than her powerful forehand. When Moran entered the All England Championship at Wimbledon that summer, she was the fourth-ranked player in America. Eager to wear something more feminine than standard tennis togs for her first appearance at the storied English tournament, Moran commissioned a new outfit from Ted Tinling, a noted British designer and tennis enthusiast. Tinling’s creation was a knee-clearing tennis dress that was paired with lace-trimmed shorts. When play began and the courtside crowd caught its first glimpse of lace beneath Moran’s flying skirt, there was an uproar. Moran lost in the third round but became front-page news for allegedly violating Wimbledon’s decorum. Soon afterward, she left the amateur ranks to join the professional tennis tour."
86909,"Born Hackensack, New Jersey    A career officer who attained the rank of colonel (1852) and served as adjutant general of the U.S. Army, Samuel Cooper forged a close friendship with Jefferson Davis during the latter’s tenure as U.S. secretary of war. In March 1861, Cooper resigned his commission and offered his services to the Confederacy and to its new president, Davis, who appointed him adjutant and inspector general of the Confederate army. Greatly prized for his administrative abilities, Cooper became the Confederacy’s highest-ranking army officer. When the Civil War ended, he ensured the preservation of Confederate War Department records by turning them over to federal authorities."
86910,"Growing up on the Hopi reservation, Nampeyo was encouraged by her grandmother, a well-respected artist, to pursue the art of ceramics. By the century's end she had earned a reputation as one of the finest potters in the Southwest. During this period, archaeological excavations of prehistoric sites in the region were unearthing potsherds from the distant past, and Nampeyo found inspiration in these relics' traditional designs. While she developed a style that honored the past, she also experimented with materials and introduced innovative shapes and decorative elements in her pottery. Her work was widely collected by institutions such as the Smithsonian and also by the growing number of tourists who visited the Southwest. She became so popular that both the Santa Fe Railroad and the Fred Harvey Company-which operated a chain of western hotels and restaurants-incorporated her portrait and her pottery in their advertising."
86914,"Martin Luther King Jr. and Ralph Abernathy ride the first integrated bus in Montgomery, Alabama  King proved to be the ideal choice to orchestrate and sustain the Montgomery bus boycott. As a relative newcomer to Montgomery, he was able to bring together all factions of the black community without regard to past rivalries. Through inspirational addresses delivered at mass meetings in Montgomery’s black churches, King galvanized support for the boycott and clearly articulated the case for nonviolent action, declaring, ""We must meet the forces of hate with the power of love; we must meet physical force with soul force."" He found a strong ally in fellow Montgomery minister Ralph Abernathy, and during the course of the boycott the two men forged a strong working relationship and a deep friendship. Continuing for an unprecedented 381 days, the bus boycott ended only after the United States Supreme Court ruled bus segregation unconstitutional. When the first integrated bus rolled through Montgomery on December 21, 1956, King and Abernathy sat side by side."
86938,"Edward Estlin Cummings is particularly attractive to people discovering poetry for the first time. Look! There is no punctuation or capitalization. He’s breaking all the rules! Cummings’s verse embodies a sense of anarchic freedom from structure and regulations that is liberating and attractive at first. But the effect begins to pall with repetition. For Cummings, rule-breaking was really only superficial: he just didn’t like the regulations about punctuation or grammar. Alternatively he was fond of rhyme and traditional forms like the sonnet. His cultural critique tended toward the satiric rather than the radical or the deeply thought-out. Curiously, reading him one is reminded of a “traditional” poet like Edward Arlington Robinson rather than a true breaker of forms like Ezra Pound or William Carlos Williams. "
86939,"Composer/pianist Billy Strayhorn never achieved the celebrity that some other jazz musicians enjoyed in their lifetimes. Nevertheless, his composing and arranging collaboration with Duke Ellington over three decades yielded many of the most memorable compositions in the history of jazz. In fact, Ellington and Strayhorn worked so closely that it was often difficult to determine where one began and the other left off. As Ellington once put it, ""Billy Strayhorn was my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head.""   Among Strayhorn's greatest assets was a solid musical education that included thorough grounding in classical music. Doubtless that training contributed to the remarkably sophisticated character of many of his compositions and the echoes of such composers as Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel that can be found in them. "
86940,"As a cattle rancher in Illinois, Joseph Glidden was familiar with the difficulties of containing livestock on land that was largely empty of traditional fencing materials such as timber and stone. In 1873, at a local county fair, he was inspired by an exhibit of armored wire fencing made of wood and metal points. Glidden improved the design by twisting short pieces of wire into sharp points, which were then fastened around a wire. Glidden received a patent for his improvements to barbed wire in 1874 and sold half of his interest to an investor for $60,000. This portrait shows Glidden prior to this achievement. He sits beside a table on which rests a sculpture of a woman and a plow-a symbol of agrarian prosperity. Glidden's barbed wire proved very popular and further accelerated the establishment of ranches and farms throughout the West. "
86946,"In 1893, when a young art editor at Harper's designed a poster in the decorative style of the European poster craze to announce an upcoming issue, the results launched a competition for stylish magazine advertising in America. William Sergeant Kendall made three monthly placards for Scribner's, including this January 1895 image of the painter Robert Blum. Kendall's use of an angled viewpoint and heavy, dark contours suggests the influence of Japanese prints. The effect was noted by a contemporary critic, who wrote in 1895 that Kendall's portraits were ""a telegraph utterance, short, nervous, incisive, spoken with a dash and go which seem to imply 'I have not time to linger on the curves of those lips, on the turn of that eyebrow, and neither do you. . . . I have uttered the essential thought; you may fill in the rest.'"" Instead of using the magazine's masthead, Kendall hand-lettered the text himself, balancing the off-center composition.  "
86947,"Richard Avedon's portrait of Duchamp, shot at close range, reveals Duchamp's aging features in detail, from the delicate hairs of his eyebrows to the wrinkled skin and tendons of his hands. Although the artist was growing older, his influence continued to increase, especially among such younger American artists as Andy Warhol, Jasper Johns, and John Cage. Robert Lebel's monograph on Duchamp, which was released in the United States in 1959, contributed to this rise in Duchamp's fame. At the time that Avedon took his photograph, Duchamp, despite his claims to have abandoned art altogether, was secretly at work on Etant donnés, an installation that was revealed after his death in 1968.  With his hands lightly touching the sides of his nose and casting shadows onto his face, Duchamp looks off to one side, remaining enigmatic even under the scrutiny of Avedon's lens. "
86963,"Although World War II posters frequently depicted an average soldier, worker, or housewife, some featured renowned personalities like Fleet Admiral William F. Halsey, whose famous motto, ""Hit hard! Hit fast! Hit often!"" seemed to embody his commanding persona. This poster captures the gusto of ""Bull"" Halsey, who was the first to lead U.S. counterstrikes against Japan and won victories in the Solomon Islands, the Philippines, Okinawa, and other areas in the South Pacific. Leaning forward, Halsey squints into the distance with binoculars in hand as though he is in the midst of attacking his enemy. Printed in the millions for display in U.S. factories, industrial incentive posters such as these conflated battle lines with production lines, in this case seeming to unite them under Halsey's command. Urging industrial workers to join the fight, the poster argues that what they are really ""producing"" is victory at sea. "
86970,"  The anti-Vietnam War movement became a defining marker of youth culture in the late 1960s and early 1970s as increasing numbers of students realized the strength of their collective voice. Posters were a frequently used tool of protest, displayed on college campuses and held aloft in marches and demonstrations. The Student Mobilization Committee, a national organization that encouraged the formation of campus committees to end the war, issued the poster Bring the Troops Home Now. The phrase was also a slogan for antiwar organizations and rallies, as well as the title of a newsletter that sought to direct the movement toward troop reduction. The poster's designer, Nancy Coner, summoned many potent signals of the era, including rock-poster lettering, a pinwheel, helmeted and slain troops, riot police, a pontificating President Johnson, and placards with more antiwar slogans."
86972,"Huey Newton　 1942–1989  Born Monroe, Louisiana  Bobby Seale　 born 1937  Born Dallas, Texas    Huey Newton and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in Oakland, California, in the fall of 1966. Having previously worked together at a neighborhood antipoverty center, the two hoped to prevent abusive behavior by local police and to provide assistance programs to the city’s poor African American residents. When Newton was jailed for the murder of a policeman, he and the Black Panthers became the national icon of militant black nationalists. Given the fiery rhetoric of its leaders, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was moved to describe the Panthers in 1969 as America’s greatest national security threat. By the time of Newton’s release on appeal in 1970, the Panthers had branch offices in more than thirty cities. In this poster by Emory Douglas, the Panthers’ minister of culture, Newton and Seale stand outside their Oakland headquarters."
87135,"Norman Lewis began his artistic career in the 1930s as a social realist, creating paintings that made visible the plight of the poor and the disenfranchised. But like other Abstract Expressionists who got their start working for the New Deal's Federal Art Program, Lewis later moved away from so-called ""social painting"" to explore the creative possibilities of abstraction. During this period, he sought to make art that was ""above criticism,"" in the hope that it wouldn't ""be discussed in terms of the fact that I'm black."" As he explained in 1946-the same year in which his friend Alex John created this portrait-""the excellence of [the African American artist's] work will be the most effective blow against stereotype and the most irrefutable proof of the artificiality of stereotype in general."" Lewis was also a well-regarded teacher at various schools, including New York's Art Students League."
87239,"Lionel Hampton began his musical career as a drummer in Les Hite's band, but that changed in the early 1930s, when he tried playing a vibraphone in an idle moment at a recording session. The vibraphone was soon his instrument of choice, and over the next several years, his skill on it earned it a significant place in the jazz idiom. In 1940, after playing for four years with the Benny Goodman Quartet, Hampton formed his own band. Claiming a roster of musicians that included such jazz notables as Quincy Jones and Charlie Mingus, the group became one of America's most highly regarded big bands. Hampton's most endearing trait was his high-energy spontaneity that sometimes raised audience enthusiasm to a fever pitch. ""We got no routine,"" he once said, ""We just act the way the spirit moves us."""
87240,"The “Teflon president”     Democratic congresswoman Patricia Schroeder dubbed Ronald Reagan the “Teflon president” because it appeared that nothing negative stuck to him. However, he contended with hostile commentary in the national media and often bitter criticism from policy experts. His views differed markedly from theirs on the Soviet Union and the government’s proper role in the economy. Critics derided Reagan’s depiction of the Soviet Union as a decaying empire. His promise to reduce economic regulations and shrink the national government also ran counter to conventional thinking. Notwithstanding this criticism, Schroeder’s assessment was correct, as Reagan remained remarkably popular.                  Andy Warhol was fascinated with Ronald Reagan, attending both of his inaugurations. Warhol used a 1953 advertisement to draw a parallel between the shirt collar that won't wrinkle and the “Teflon president.”   "
87316,"Born New York City  Embracing the dance revolution Agnes de Mille had launched, Jerome Robbins envisioned a dance that expressed “good, healthy American energy and vitality.” In more than sixty ballets and such legendary Broadway musicals as On the Town and West Side Story, Robbins did just that. Beginning with his 1944 ballet Fancy Free, he choreographed the savvy swagger of street life around Times Square, where energy was “all bubbling out over us.”  Robbins spoke eloquently about the American tempo of dance, describing how it “has been completely influenced and drastically changed by this nation and the culture in which it has grown up. We in America dress, eat, think, talk and walk differently from any other people. We also dance differently.” His choreography conveyed a special American look that was natural, loose, and at ease: a dance that moved like a baseball player runs."
87327,"Cab Calloway began performing in Chicago and New York City in the late 1920s. The bandleader and singer became famous after recording ""Minnie the Moocher"" in 1931-the first jazz song to sell a million copies-and helped popularize ""scat"" singing during the Swing era. Calloway toured extensively, broadcast often on radio, and appeared in films ranging from Stormy Weather (1943) to The Blues Brothers (1980). He also appeared on Broadway as Sportin' Life in a 1950 revival of Porgy and Bess (he claimed the character was based on him), and with Pearl Bailey in the 1967 all-black revival of Hello, Dolly!"
87328,"Born Essex, England     Lynn Fontanne studied with Ellen Terry, then England’s most revered actress, and was just beginning her own distinguished career when she posed for Wilfred de Glehn in 1912 to earn extra money as an artist’s model. It would be another decade before she and Alfred Lunt met and formed the most critically acclaimed theatrical partnership of their generation. Married in 1922, Lunt and Fontanne brought a naturalism to acting that transformed American theater: one critic wrote, “they play together . . . with a fluency that is matchless.” From 1928 until they retired in 1960, they excelled in urbane comedy and starred in twenty-seven productions, including Pygmalion, Design for Living, Taming of the Shrew, and The Guardsman. Fontanne received the American Academy of Arts and Letters Gold Medal in 1935 and was honored with a lifetime achievement award at the Kennedy Center in 1980."
87329,"Agnes Ernst, the New York Sun's first female reporter, became intrigued by modern art in 1908 when she interviewed Alfred Stieglitz. After her 1910 marriage to financier Eugene Meyer, she became a patron of the Stieglitz circle's crusade for modernism. Along with Marius de Zayas and Paul Haviland, she established the Modern Gallery and the avant-garde journal 291. She also encouraged de Zayas's artistic experiments, including his radical concept of abstract portraiture. Here, oval forms convey Meyer's broad brow, eyes, and prominent chin while curving lines allude to her full-length figure in profile. The symmetrical balance of these elements around a central axis connotes Meyer's classical beauty. The mathematical formula symbolizes her intelligence, and upward-sweeping diagonals indicate Meyer's dynamic progress through life."
87371,"In the early 1820s Thomas L. McKenney (1785–1859) launched a massive project to preserve a record of Native Americans, resulting in the three-volume, folio-sized History of the Indian Tribes of North America. He commissioned artist Charles Bird King to paint tribal representatives visiting Washington, secured James Hall as an author, and hired Philadelphia lithographers to make the 120 hand-colored portraits. Because of the complexity of the project and insufficient financing, the principals went through multiple draftsmen, lithography companies, and publishers. James Hall (1793–1868) finally brought the project to completion early in 1844 with the fifth publisher. Although the text reflects racist prejudices of the day, the publication is a monumental achievement in portraiture.     Historia de las tribus indígenas de Norteamérica, vol. II, por Thomas L. McKenney y James Hall     A principios de la década de 1820, Thomas L. McKenney (1785–1859) inició un proyecto de gran escala para elaborar un registro de indígenas norteamericanos, el cual culminó en una publicación de tres volúmenes tamaño folio: Historia de las tribus indígenas de Norteamérica. McKenney encargó al artista Charles Bird King pintar a los representantes de las tribus que visitaran Washington, consiguió que James Hall escribiera los textos y contrató a varios litógrafos de Filadelfia para que reprodujeran los 120 retratos y los colorearan a mano. Dada la complejidad del proyecto y la falta de fondos, los dirigentes fueron pasando por diversos diseñadores, empresas de litografía y editoriales. James Hall (1793–1868) por fin llevó el proyecto a su término con la quinta editorial, a principios de 1844. Si bien el texto refleja los prejuicios racistas de su época, la publicación es un logro monumental en lo que al arte del retrato se refiere.      Publicado por Daniel Rice y James G.

87423,"In August 1857, at the time abolitionist John Brown wrote this letter to a New England benefactor, he had become both feared and hunted in Kansas, which was in the throes of deadly guerrilla war over slavery. The year before, Brown with his sons had led a murderous attack against five slavery sympathizers in Osawatomie. But now with Kansas resorting more to ballots than bullets, Brown, seeking refuge in Tabor, Iowa, was laying plans for another, bigger scheme-a large slave insurrection back east at Harpers Ferry. ""I am in immediate want,"" wrote Brown, ""of from Five Hundred to One Thousand Dollars for secret service & no questions asked."""
87604,"Although first renowned as a comic and then a dancer, Baker had a long recording career, and much of her reputation, especially in her later life, was based on her singing. This poster for Columbia Records was based on a photograph made in Havana, Cuba, by Armando Hernandez."
87605,"Film poster advertising after World War II generally retained the photographic realism and unambitious designs of wartime messages. This poster, however, advertising Otto Preminger's Carmen Jones, an updated version of Bizet's famous opera, stands out as an unusually successful example from the time period. The beautiful Dorothy Dandridge could both sing and act, and  she became the first African American to win an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Unfortunately, what seemed to be the beginning of a stellar career was actually its climax, since good roles for black actresses were practically nonexistent in mainstream films. But every element of the poster for Carmen Jones-vivacious pose, life-size scale, ambiguous space, simplified color scheme, and jazzy lettering-adds to her glamour and promise. "
87730,"Born Ashfield, Massachusetts  Director Cecil B. DeMille’s repertory boasts such classic films as Cleopatra (1934), The Greatest Show on Earth (1952), and The Ten Commandments (1956), but his significance began in the 1910s and 1920s when he helped found the Hollywood movie colony. He directed dozens of early movies—including The Squaw Man (1914), Carmen (1915), Male and Female (1919), The Ten Commandments (1923), and The King of Kings (1927)—and helped establish Gloria Swanson, Claudette Colbert, Gary Cooper, and Paulette Goddard by casting them repeatedly in his pictures. DeMille later appeared as himself in Sunset Boulevard (1950), and the film ends with Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson) famously saying, ""All right, Mr. DeMille, I’m ready for my close-up."" This photograph, taken by his cinematographer Karl Struss, depicts DeMille in his ornate studio office."
87731,"Although Cecil B. DeMille trained as a stage actor and originally knew nothing about making motion pictures, he directed one of the first full-length films in Hollywood in 1914, an adaptation of a western play titled The Squaw Man. The previous year, DeMille had formed a partnership with Jesse Lasky and Samuel Goldwyn in the production company that later became Paramount Pictures. A pioneering director and producer, he made seventy films over the course of his career that helped make Hollywood and California synonymous with the motion picture industry. Challenging traditional storylines, his films often caused outrage among some who believed he sacrificed his own morality for commercial success. In this publicity photograph, DeMille wears his trademark director's uniform, which included riding boots and pants. "
87927,"The first peace medals that the U.S. government gave Native Americans—created in 1792, 1793, and 1795—were hand-engraved rather than struck at the U.S. Mint. The obverse depicts Washington standing with a Native American chief who is smoking a pipe, his tomahawk on the ground beside him. The reverse shows an American eagle with olive branches and arrows in its talons and a ribbon with the motto E Pluribus Unum in its beak. The silver loop at the top allowed the medal to be worn on a cord or ribbon. Red Jacket wears a similar medal in his portrait in this exhibition.     Las primeras medallas de la paz que el gobierno estadounidense obsequió a los indígenas (creadas en 1792, 1793 y 1795) fueron labradas a mano, no acuñadas en la Casa de Moneda.

88077,"The silver medals created for Thomas Jefferson established the pattern for peace medals, with a portrait on one side and a message of friendship and peace on the other. Medals were created in several sizes, with the size designating the importance of the Native recipient. The medals expressed the power of the president and conferred great status on the owner. Meriwether Lewis and William Clark took a large number of silver medals bearing Jefferson’s image with them on their journey to the Pacific coast in order to help gain the respect and friendship of Native tribes. Medals created for James Monroe and James Madison were similar in format.    Las medallas de la paz creadas en plata para Thomas Jefferson establecieron un patrón para este tipo de objeto, con un retrato en una de las caras y un mensaje de amistad y paz en la otra. Se hacían en varios tamaños, según la importancia del personaje indígena a quien se otorgarían. Estas medallas eran signo del poder del presidente y por tanto conferían un gran reconocimiento. Meriwether Lewis y William Clark llevaron gran cantidad de medallas de plata con la imagen de Jefferson en su viaje a la costa del Pacífico como recurso para ganarse el respeto y la amistad de las tribus nativas.

88078,"President George Washington began the practice of presenting peace medals to Indian chiefs on such important occasions as the signing of a treaty or a visit to the capital. By the time of Madison’s presidency, the Indians considered the medals an essential part of negotiations. In May 1812, John Mason, head of the Office of Indian Trade, ordered new Madison medals after learning that several chiefs would be visiting Washington. He did not want to give them leftover hollow Jefferson medals, knowing they preferred the solid ones the British gave out. Mason engaged John Reich, assistant to the chief coiner at the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia, to cut the dies and strike the medals. Finally, on December 17, 1814, twelve silver medals of three different sizes arrived in Washington. The largest, pictured here, was given to the most important Indian chiefs.

88087,"Indian peace medals are an important part of the history of U.S. presidential portraiture and also an essential element in federal Indian policy. Presented to Indian chiefs on such important occasions as the signing of a treaty or a visit to the nation's capital, the medals gave rank and distinction, and many were passed down from generation to generation.   In the first half of the nineteenth century, design was determined by the need to win the allegiance of the Indians.

88115,"Born Westmoreland County, Virginia  George Washington’s death on December 14, 1799, caused an outpouring of national grief. Among the funeral orations, memorial poems, songs, and visual images inspired by his demise is this equestrian portrait by William Clarke, which refers to his military and presidential achievements. Washington was also known for his skilled horsemanship. As Thomas Jefferson recalled in an 1814 letter, Washington was “the best horseman of his age, and the most graceful figure that could be seen on horseback.”  This likeness is based on Gilbert Stuart’s “Atheneum” 1796 portrait of 1796, which was well known through replicas and engravings. The artist, William Clarke, worked in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and in Maryland before moving to Philadelphia around 1796. There he was associated with a group of artists specializing in ornamental painting, portraiture, and the decoration of drums and banners."
88124,"Trained in Paris at the École des Beaux-Arts, Henry Hobson Richardson became America's leading architect in the late 1800s. He designed a wide range of structures, including churches, railroad stations, department stores, courthouses, libraries, and private homes. Best known today for Trinity Church in Boston, Massachusetts, Richardson fused the Romanesque style of medieval France with the picturesque style popular in England and the United States.  In this portrait, British artist Hubert von Herkomer found his sitter's girth, accentuated by the rounded pitcher in the background, an ideal metaphor for his character. During the sittings, Herkomer noted that Richardson was ""as solid in his friendship as in his figure. Big-bodied, big-hearted, large-minded, full-brained, loving as he is pugnacious."" An admirer of Herkomer's work, Richardson created plans for the artist's country house as payment for the likeness.  "
88240,"Memphis and the ""mountaintop""  Responding to an urgent appeal from striking sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, Martin Luther King traveled there on March 28, 1968, to lead a demonstration in support of their demands. He was devastated when the march collapsed in rioting perpetrated by militant youths. Deeply concerned that the nonviolent tenets of the civil rights movement had been seriously discredited, King vowed to redeem them by staging a follow-up march on April 8 that would be a model of peaceful protest. On April 3, in an impassioned address to supporters at Memphis’s Mason Temple, King declared:  I’ve been to the mountaintop. . . . And I have seen the promised land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we as a people will get to the promised land!   The following evening, as he stood on a balcony at the Lorraine Motel, Martin Luther King was shot and killed by James Earl Ray."
88245,"At the turn of the twentieth century, Ezra Pound demanded that American poets “make it [poetry] new.” If Walt Whitman laid the groundwork for modern poetry, Pound ushered it into the new century with an insistence that form should be as modern as poetry’s subjects. Pound was antipathetic to Whitman, possibly because they were both too alike in their mission to break existing literary molds and create a new poetics. Pound was also a generous and keen-eyed supporter of rising talent; among his protégés were Robert Frost and T. S. Eliot.              Pound’s verse was fast, glancing, and imagistic. He wrote the shortest great poem ever, “In a Station of the Metro,” which reads: “The apparition of these faces in the crowd; / Petals on a wet, black bough.” His great work was the impossibly sprawling Cantos, which he began in 1917 and finished in 1969, with a total of 109 works. It is a modern epic that begins with allusions to the Odyssey (“And then went down to the ship / Set keel to breakers, forth on the godly sea”), surveys world and American history, sets out Pound’s ill-considered (and anti-Semitic) economic schemes, and ends in confusion and incoherence, mirroring Pound’s own personal fate."
88272,"Born New York City?     Margaret Whetten was a widow living in New York City when the British occupied it during the Revolution. Gifted with a “quickness of repartee and a rather pungent humor,” Whetten won the confidence of the city’s British and Hessian captors and used her influence to aid the American cause. She and her daughters provided food and clothing to American prisoners with such determination that the British jailors were reluctant to interfere with their acts of mercy. In addition, the Whetten home, dubbed “Rebel Headquarters,” served as a refuge for American spies. After the war, George Washington sent a letter of gratitude to Whetten for her service."
88273,"Born New York City?     During the British occupation of New York City at the height of the American Revolution, Margaret Todd Whetten and her daughter, Margaret Whetten Dean, provided food and clothing for the American prisoners of the British army. The Whetten home also occasionally served as a refuge for American spies. After the war, George Washington personally thanked Mrs. Whetten for her service. These hand-colored wax portraits are similar to those made by Johann Christian Rauschner, a German artist who worked in New York in 1799, and again from 1802 to 1808. The fine details are characteristic of this unusual portrait medium."
88365,"On succeeding to the presidency after the death of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman was conscious of how unprepared he was, saying that he felt “like the moon and stars had fallen on him”; even as vice president he had not known about the development of an atomic bomb. Nonetheless, he was determined in his first foray into international relations to hold his own against Churchill and Stalin. The war in Europe had ended in May, and the Big Three met at Potsdam (outside Berlin) in July to discuss the ongoing war in the Pacific and postwar diplomacy in light of the agreements reached at Yalta the previous February. Truman dropped a broad hint that the U.S. had a powerful new weapon.   The conference occurred during Britain’s first postwar election. So the British delegation was led first by Churchill and then by Clement Atlee, who took over when the Labour Party swept into power. "
88369,"Carte-de-visite portraits of Confederate generals  During the Civil War, the Union blockade of southern ports effectively halted the flow of most goods, including materials needed by Confederate photographers to continue their operations. Although some photographic supplies were smuggled through, by January 1862 it was reported in the North that ""the Photographic Art down South has completely died out in consequence of the war."" Because southern cameramen had virtually nothing to work with, photographs representing Confederate leaders, such as these portraits of generals Simon Bolivar Buckner, Braxton Bragg, and Albert Sidney Johnston, typically circulated in the form of retouched copy images produced in the North by such firms as E. & H. T. Anthony rather than as original life portraits created in the South."
88370,"Edmund Ruffin of Virginia had made his reputation as the South's leading agricultural reformer. But by the 1850s he was known as one of the foremost agitators for secession. In 1859, after witnessing John Brown's execution in Charles Town, Virginia, Ruffin arranged to have one of Brown's pikes (intended for the use of slave insurgents) sent to each governor of a slaveholding state, with the label, ""Sample of the favors designed for us by our Northern Brethren.""   Ruffin welcomed the start of war in April 1861, allegedly firing one of the first rebel shots at Fort Sumter in Charleston harbor. Yet the war's end left him bitter. With his plantation despoiled, his slaves set free, and the southern cause lost, Ruffin loaded a gun and shot himself."
88373,"Born Newark, New Jersey     Known popularly as “the divine Sarah” and “Sassy,” Sarah Vaughan was regarded as one of the premier female vocalists of her day. Drawn to music from an early age, she studied piano and sang in her church choir as a youth. When Vaughan was eighteen, she entered an amateur talent contest at Harlem’s Apollo Theater on a dare and won first prize. This success led to frequent invitations to perform alongside the leading figures in contemporary jazz, including Earl “Fatha” Hines, Dizzy Gillespie, and Billy Eckstein. Adept at bebop improvisation, Vaughan possessed a wonderfully versatile voice that complemented a larger jazz ensemble. By 1950—the year in which Josef Breitenbach created this portrait—she was selling upwards of three million records a year. During this period, a poll in Down Beat magazine named her the top female singer for six consecutive years."
88374,"  ""I place no value upon literal transcripts from Nature,"" wrote the artist Thomas Moran in 1879. ""My general scope is not realistic; all my tendencies are towards idealization."" Inspired by romantic literature, Moran painted canvases that transformed the West into an Edenic paradise. As a member of several government expeditions into the West, Moran had firsthand experience with the awe-inspiring vistas he later interpreted in his work. He traveled to Yellowstone in 1871, before it became a national park, and the work that resulted from this trip helped to popularize it as a tourist destination. Curiously, however, when westward expansion encroached upon the pristine wilderness, Moran did not include the telltale signs of civilization's progress. Even in his old age Moran continued to paint with fervor. As one reporter observed in 1922, ""He was the picture of intensity and energy. I never saw such concentration.""   "
88376,"During the third week of January 1961, preparations began for the inauguration of John F. Kennedy as Washington braced itself for a snowstorm. On Thursday, January 19, the temperature dropped, the wind picked up, and it began snowing hard. Typically for the capital, streets were unplowed, and cars were abandoned. On Pennsylvania Avenue, workmen struggled to clear the parade route, and soldiers used flame throwers to melt the ice around the inaugural stand. The snow stopped before dawn on January 20. Inauguration Day was bitterly cold and windy but sunny. In the traditional ritual of the transfer of power, Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy rode together in a limousine to the Capitol. At twenty minutes after noon, the ceremonies began. "
88377,"Although the Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin earned the title of first man in space on April 12, 1961, the Mercury 7-America's participants in the first phase of its space program-were national heroes. From left to right stand Alan Shepard (whose head appears first), Wally Schirra, Gus Grissom, Scott Carpenter, John Glenn, Deke Slayton, and Gordon Cooper. Well dressed and training their attention on a monitor picturing a gantry at Cape Canaveral, the team of men, whom author Tom Wolfe later described as embodying the ""right stuff,"" convey intelligence, competence, and warmth. Alan Shepard became the first American in space on May 5, 1961, and less than a year later, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth.  "
88379,"By 1962, Attorney General Robert Kennedy was President John Kennedy's closest adviser, even in foreign affairs. This was most evident during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. When reconnaissance flights detected Soviet missiles in Cuba, President Kennedy and his advisers agreed that this should not be allowed, but disagreed on how to get Nikita Khrushchev to remove them. Some advocated an air strike; Robert Kennedy was among the most vocal against such an attack, calling it ""Pearl Harbor in reverse."" He convinced his brother to establish a naval blockade to turn back Soviet ships carrying missiles. After a tense week long showdown bringing the U.S. and Soviet Union the closest they would come to nuclear conflict, Khrushchev agreed to call back his ships in return for a U.S. promise not to invade Cuba.  "
88403,"Born Oakville, Alabama  Adolph Hitler intended the 1936 Berlin Olympics to be a grand statement celebrating “Deutschland Uber Alles.” But Jesse Owens, a grandson of slaves, heroically interrupted Hitler’s intention to make the games a showcase for Aryan supremacy.  A track and field star at Ohio State, Owens had broken five world records in 1935, but these were just a prelude for his Olympian performance a year later. Photographed by documentary filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl as he competed in Berlin’s Olympic Stadium, Owens broke or equaled nine Olympic records and set three world records. Most important, he won four gold medals—in the 100m, 200m, and 4x100m relay, and the long jump.  In 1950 an Associated Press poll voted Jesse Owens the greatest track and field star of the first half of the twentieth century. He was awarded a Medal of Freedom by President Gerald Ford in 1976, and a street in Berlin was named in his honor in 1984."
88407,"James VanDerZee's portrait of Father Divine illustrates the charismatic religious leader amid a background of heavenly clouds. The founder of a communal organization later known as the Peace Mission Movement, Father Divine-born George Baker-regarded himself as the incarnation of God. Although some dismissed this sharecropper's son as a charlatan, he amassed a following that looked to him not only for spiritual guidance, but for help in finding employment and housing. His free weekly banquets-open to all-drew large crowds and much publicity. Centered in New York City, where he had settled around 1915, his work was especially appreciated during the Great Depression. Father Divine was also committed to social and racial equality and urged his believers to lead positive lives, free of prejudice and selfishness. In 1942 he relocated to a large estate outside Philadelphia, from which he continued to lead his followers."
88408,"The fruits of the Civil War were the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution. Respectively they abolished slavery, guaranteed citizenship to all persons born in the United States, and granted the right to vote (to male citizens), regardless of ""race, color, or previous condition of servitude."" The Fifteenth Amendment was especially significant because for the first time in the nation's history, a minority class was empowered. ""A man with a ballot in his hand is the master of the situation,"" wrote former abolitionist Wendell Phillips.  This hand-colored lithograph commemorates the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment and the national celebration held in Baltimore.  "
88445,"Born Atlanta, Georgia  Although many important civil rights leaders emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Martin Luther King personified the struggle for African American equality and justice. King’s synthesis of Christian theology and its message of a supporting and loving God, together with Mohandas Gandhi’s tactics of nonviolent protest, became the defining features of the civil rights movement. In 1963 King focused the nation’s attention on the African American struggle by leading a massive civil rights protest in Birmingham, Alabama, and helping to organize the August 28, 1963, March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, in which he delivered his historic “I Have a Dream” speech."
88510,"Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, archbishop of Chicago, one of the most influential American religious leaders of the later twentieth century, here holds the symbolic red hat he received when Pope John Paul II appointed him to the College of Cardinals in 1982. Linking abortion with assisted suicide and the death penalty, as well as with nuclear weapons, racial injustice, and poverty, Bernardin urged Catholics to consider what he called ""a consistent ethic of life.""  At the time Bernardin made public his impending death from inoperable cancer, his private secretary, Monsignor Kenneth Velo, asked Evanston, Illinois, artist Richard Halstead to paint his portrait. Bernardin proved too ill to pose, but the artist was able to sketch and photograph him. ""The portrait demonstrates,"" assessed Velo, ""the gentleness and strength, the character and depth of this great churchman."""
88527,"Born Cincinnati, Ohio  Roy Rogers began his film career in the shadow of singing cowboy Gene Autry, but emerged as a star in his own right in 1942 after Autry left Hollywood for military service in World War II. Proclaimed ""King of the Cowboys,"" Rogers rode to enormous box office popularity astride Trigger, his specially trained palomino billed as the ""Smartest Horse in the Movies."" As the genial, clean-cut cowboy who triumphed over evil in dozens of westerns, he became a hero to millions of young moviegoers. In a single month in 1945, he received nearly 75,000 fan letters, and when Life magazine asked youngsters who they most wished to emulate, Rogers was ranked with Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln. He later made a successful transition to television, where from 1951 to 1957 he starred with his wife, Dale Evans, in the popular Roy Rogers Show."
88532,"Blinded at five, singer-composer Ray Charles learned the rudiments of his musicianship at a school for the deaf and blind in his native Florida. In his early performing career, he modeled his style largely on singer Nat ""King"" Cole. By the early 1950s, however, he was developing his own original blend of blues and gospel that would lead to his first major hit recording, ""I've Got a Woman,"" and ultimately make him the ""father of soul music."" The winner of eleven Grammy Awards and a Kennedy Center Honors award, Charles had many hits that have long since become classics of pop music, including ""Georgia on My Mind"" and ""Hit the Road, Jack."" He also exercised enormous influence on other performers, and many experts number him among the most important American musicians of his time."
88586,"Born Richmond County, Virginia  Samuel Griffin, born into a prominent Virginia family, studied law and was admitted to the bar in Virginia. In 1770, when Scottish portraitist Cosmo Alexander was painting in Williamsburg, Griffin sat for this portrait. During the Revolutionary War, he was a colonel and served as aide-de-camp to General Charles Lee. A Federalist, he represented Williamsburg in the Virginia Assembly (1786–88) before representing Virginia in the First Federal Congress in 1789. He was reelected twice more before declining to run again in 1796, when James Madison’s Republican policies gained predominance in his district. "
88637,"A bug-eyed vaudevillian who got his Broadway start in Ziegfeld extravaganzas and went on to delight audiences in a string of musical comedy hits in the 1920s, Eddie Cantor was instrumental in spanning the gap between traditional show business and the emerging world of mass-media entertainment. In September 1931, Cantor became the first major Broadway star to host his own weekly radio program when he launched ""The Chase and Sanborn Hour"" on the NBC network. Bolstered by a cast of popular regulars and a ""who's who"" of guest performers, Cantor quickly took his variety show to the top of the ratings, where it remained year after year. He enjoyed similar success in films throughout the 1930s and became a small-screen favorite in 1950 with his Colgate Comedy Hour.  This playful image of Cantor was produced by Steichen as an advertisement for NBC."
88657,"A groundbreaking actor who was unafraid to challenge racial stereotypes, Canada Lee worked on and off stage to dismantle barriers erected by bigotry. Following his critically acclaimed portrayal of Bigger Thomas in the 1941 Broadway adaptation of Richard Wright's Native Son, Lee sought out roles that represented African Americans as multidimensional human beings rather than racial caricatures. In 1944 he embraced radio as a means of promoting racial tolerance when he became the narrator for New World A-Coming-the first radio program in the nation to address what was then termed ""the Negro question."" Politically active throughout the 1940s, Lee was falsely branded a Communist at the height of his career. Blacklisted and barred from working in the American entertainment industry, he gave his final performance in the 1951 British film Cry, the Beloved Country, the first motion picture to deal with apartheid."
88759,"Although Benjamin Lay stood just four feet, seven inches tall, this Quaker reformer raised a forceful voice against slavery. Born in England, Lay arrived in Philadelphia by way of Barbados, where the treatment of slaves horrified him. Vocal in his opposition, Lay described those who kept slaves as ""proud, lazy, tyrannical, gluttonous, drunken, debauched . . . the Scum of the infernal Pit."" In 1737, Lay publicly condemned Quaker slave owners in a book published by Benjamin Franklin. Late in life, Lay saw his views broadly adopted by other Quakers. This print by Henry Dawkins, based on the painting by William Williams on view in gallery E152, came, as physician and statesman Benjamin Rush noted, ""to be seen in many houses in Philadelphia."" In it, Lay appears in front of the grotto that served as his study, holding a tract by Thomas Tryon advocating healthful living."
88878,"The musical prodigy known as ""Blind Tom"" was one of the most celebrated African American concert artists of the nineteenth century. Blind from birth and possibly autistic, Tom was only four when he began performing tunes he had heard played on the piano of his owner, James Bethune. Tom made his professional debut as a pianist in 1857 at the age of eight and was soon earning a fortune for Bethune with engagements throughout the country. When the Civil War began, Tom was returned to Georgia and compelled to play benefit concerts for the Confederate cause. To protect his financial interest in Tom, Bethune obtained legal guardianship of the teenager-a move that effectively prevented Tom from ever securing his freedom. After the war, Tom continued his career, performing a demanding repertoire with skill ""so startling as to amaze every listener."" "
88924,"Elected to the United States Senate in 1962, Edward Kennedy owed his early success to his close identification with his elder brothers, President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy. But ultimately, despite personal travails and controversy, Kennedy became a power in his own right and established himself  as one of the Senate's major voices of liberalism. He also evolved into an adroit political strategist, capable of exerting influence even when his own Democratic Party was not in the majority. Kennedy became best known in recent years for his role in the effort to achieve reforms and improvements in the nation's health care system. His death leaves vacant a Senate seat that the Kennedys have held for nearly sixty years.    Andy Warhol's silkscreened portrait was created as a campaign fund-raiser for Kennedy's unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 1980. It suggests the intensity and glamour of politics by enhancing Kennedy's features with thin red and blue lines and diamond dust."
88925,"   Born East Nottingham, Maryland  A Presbyterian minister, John Ewing also taught natural philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania. He nurtured a lifelong fascination with astronomy, contributing articles on the subject to the first American edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica. A member of the American Philosophical Society, Ewing initiated its participation in the international effort in 1769 to observe the transit of Venus, selecting David Rittenhouse to organize the effort. Ewing and Charles Willson Peale, his portraitist, shared political and scientific interests during the years surrounding the American Revolution; Ewing was vice president of the Philosophical Society when Peale became a member in 1786. Peale depicts Ewing in a wig often worn by those in learned professions and an elaborately ruched academic gown. The telescope in the background is a Gregorian reflector of the type sold by W. & S. Jones of London."
89344,"Patent Office Building, now the National Portrait Gallery and the Smithsonian American Art Museum  As Union troops poured into Washington in the early days of the Civil War, they were billeted temporarily in the U.S. Capitol and other government buildings. In April and May of 1861, the First Rhode Island Regiment, commanded by Colonel Ambrose E. Burnside, was quartered in the third-floor west wing of the Patent Office Building. After the battles of Manassas, Antietam, and Fredericksburg, hospital beds were set up throughout the building for wounded soldiers. Poet Walt Whitman, a former government clerk in the building, used to visit the patients here, reading to them and bringing gifts of food and writing paper. On March 6, 1865, as the war was nearing its conclusion, the Patent Office Building was the site of Abraham Lincoln’s second inaugural ball. Photographed from the southeast corner of Seventh and F Streets, N.W., this image shows the building as it looked in 1865."
89607,"Neither North nor South was prepared for the casualties caused by the Civil War. In Washington, the number of wounded soon overwhelmed the temporary hospitals that had been hastily thrown up in the city. The Patent Office Building, with its majestic Great Hall, had earlier billeted troops; it was now turned into a makeshift hospital. Whitman, who nursed there in 1863, found it poignant that the Patent Office, which celebrated American ingenuity and optimism, now harbored the wreckage of America's youth. Yet he also saw the building as a symbol of the Union's strength:   I walked up Pennsylvania Avenue, then to Seventh Street, and a long while around the Patent Office. Somehow it looked rebukefully strong, majestic, there in the delicate moonlight. The sky, the planets, the constellations all so bright, so calm, so expressively silent, so soothing, after those hospital scenes.   In 1865, Whitman clerked for the Interior Department at the Patent Office Building. He was fired from this position when it was discovered that he was the author of ""that book,"" Leaves of Grass.     Author: D. Ward"
90155,"A confectioner from Italy, Domingo Ghirardelli established himself as a chocolate merchant in Lima, Peru, before immigrating to California in 1849. Unsuccessful as a miner, Ghirardelli returned to the confectioner's trade shortly thereafter, opening his first shop in Stockton, California. Ghirardelli's business selling chocolate, coffee, and dried fruit was profitable, leading him to open a second store in San Francisco. Although a fire destroyed this establishment in 1851, he rebuilt. Ghirardelli was one of only two chocolate manufacturers in the United States before the Civil War, and his product dominated the western market. By the 1880s he was importing more than 450,000 pounds of cocoa beans a year. The photographer of this carte-de-visite portrait was George H. Johnson, who-like Ghirardelli-relocated to California during the gold rush. He also failed as a prospector, but earned a reputation for opening one of the first photography studios in San Francisco.   "
90160,"A member of the American Communist Party, Julius Rosenberg was arrested in July 1950 on charges of passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. Several months later his wife, Ethel, was arrested, and their trial turned into one of the most publicized events of the Cold War era. After the Rosenbergs were found guilty and sentenced to death, many claimed that the pair had been railroaded in an atmosphere charged with fear over the Korean War and the Soviet Union's recent success in developing an atomic bomb. Subsequent studies of the evidence, however, suggest that Julius Rosenberg, at least, was indeed spying for the Soviet Union. Pleas for leniency came from such world figures as Pope Pius XII and Albert Einstein, but Presidents Truman and Eisenhower rejected clemency appeals. On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs were executed."
90162,"Edward Kelty's portrait of Clyde Beatty depicts the charismatic animal trainer inside a steel cage at Madison Square Garden during one of his first seasons with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. Fascinated by the circus as a young child in rural Ohio, Beatty dropped out of high school to join a small regional outfit, where he performed as an acrobat. His aspiration, however, was to work with the big animals. He eventually earned his opportunity in part by ""developing the riskiest act possible-an act so dangerous that no one would want to fill in for me if offered twice my salary."" Beatty sustained more than a few injuries working with lions and tigers, which only furthered his popularity. Capitalizing on the drawing power of his act, he established the first of several ""Clyde Beatty"" circuses in 1935."
90356,"Kenneth Koch (pronounced Coke) was part of the New York School of poets who loosely grouped together during the 1950s and bridged the worlds of art and writing. Other poets included Frank O’Hara and John Ashbery; the latter had been Koch’s classmate at Harvard. Koch wrote a bit like both of them, sharing O’Hara’s quirky, offhand perception and Ashbery’s incantatory surrealism. Koch was interested in the problem of perception and knowledge, and the topic crops up repeatedly in his verse. He also taught poetry, especially to children, authoring a well-known series of books, one of which has the wonderful title Rose, Where Did You Get That Red? (1973). The title was a child’s question that precisely mirrored Koch’s poetic interrogation of the vagaries of the day-to-day world."
90451,"Born Princeton, Missouri  Born Martha Cannary, Calamity Jane earned her nickname for her riotous behavior and her ""unladylike"" appearance. Much of her life is shrouded in myth, but it is known that she moved frequently from one small town to another, working in a series of menial jobs. She spent several years in Deadwood, South Dakota, where she was known for her dalliances in brothels, her romantic association with Wild Bill Hickok, and her appetite for alcohol. Yet Calamity Jane also demonstrated genuine concern for the poor and the sick, offering sympathy and relief when others failed to help. At age twenty-five she gained a national profile when she was featured as a sidekick to the character of Deadwood Dick in the first of several dime novels. She died in 1903, most likely of alcoholism, and is buried next to Hickok in a Deadwood cemetery."
90457,"Novelist Kurt Vonnegut, highly regarded for a style that blended science fiction and surrealism-evident in the novels Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse Five-was also a prolific draftsman. ""I've drawn all my life,"" he explained, routinely signing and dating the images that covered his manuscripts. In 1973, he integrated his drawings into Breakfast of Champions, or Goodbye Blue Monday! The spirited conviction and wry sense of humor that animated Vonnegut's writing also infused his pictures, including this self-portrait, in which he portrayed himself with yellow hair. ""I asked many people . . . when . . . their art gave them the most satisfaction,"" Vonnegut reported. ""All replied without hesitation that they were most at one with the universe when making a picture in perfect solitude. All the rest [critical and commercial success] by comparison was annoying balderdash. I say that, too."""
90483,"When Katharine Hepburn struck this theatrical pose for Edward Steichen in 1933, she was one of America's rising stars. Her much-praised performance the previous year in the Broadway play The Warrior's Husband had led to a movie contract with RKO studios, and her first film, A Bill of Divorcement, had earned her much critical acclaim. Hard on its heels came the screen version of Little Women, in which, one critic said, she created ""one of the most memorable heroines of the year.""  When this picture ran in Vanity Fair, it was meant as a portent of yet another Hepburn triumph-her return to Broadway in The Lake. The play was a disaster, however, and for the next several years, Hepburn's career had some rough patches. Still, over a career that lasted more than fifty years, Hepburn won four Best Actress Oscars, a feat that remains unequaled today. "
90522,"Although Virginia lawyer John Wickham was involved in many important cases, the most celebrated was his successful 1807 defense of Aaron Burr for treason. The trial, conducted at the U.S. Circuit Court in Richmond, found Wickham basing his defense on the Constitution, which required two witnesses to an act of treason. When these witnesses could not be found, Chief Justice John Marshall (who presided at this circuit court) conceded Wickham's argument and instructed the jury accordingly.  This portrait, by French artist Charles Balthazar Julian Févret de Saint-Mémin, was created with the aid of a physiognotrace, which allowed him to capture the sitter's profile with great accuracy. Saint-Mémin portrayed many of the people who came to Richmond for Burr's trial, including prosecutor William Wirt and Judge Marshall. Like most of the artist's portrait drawings, this work became the basis for a small round engraving.  "
90538,"Hailed as the catcher who ""stopped everything behind the plate and hit everything in front of it,"" Yogi Berra was a standout performer on the New York Yankees' roster through eighteen remarkable seasons of play (1946-63). His fielding and hitting helped propel the Bronx ball club to fourteen pennants and ten World Series championships, and earned him a place on the All-Star team for fifteen consecutive years. Berra's self-effacing good humor has made him one of baseball's most endearing characters, and classic ""Yogi-isms""-such as ""It's déjà vu all over again""-have become part of the nation's vocabulary."
90628,"Born Marshall, Texas    James Farmer first experienced racial segregation at age three, when his mother had to explain to him that he could not buy a soda at a local drugstore because he was black. He never forgot that incident. Inspired by the nonviolent protest tactics of Mahatma Gandhi, Farmer helped to found the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) in 1942 and began organizing sit-ins to protest discrimination in public accommodations. In 1961 he launched the Freedom Rides to end segregation in interstate transportation and in train and bus station waiting rooms. This initiative made national headlines when two buses carrying CORE members were firebombed and the riders beaten by a white mob outside of Birmingham, Alabama. Alice Neel pictured Farmer ""full of anger"" in this portrait created in 1964, the same year that three CORE members were murdered in Mississippi.  "
90629,"Artist Roy Lichtenstein peers from behind a wide brush dripping with paint in this 1985 photograph by Abe Frajndlich. Celebrated as one of the founders of the American pop art movement, Lichtenstein worked for almost two decades as a realist painter and then as an abstract expressionist before debuting in 1962 the work for which he would be best remembered: oversized compositions based on popular advertisements and comic book illustrations. Appropriating both the content and the style of these lowbrow graphic traditions, Lichtenstein employed brightly colored Ben Day dots in rendering subjects best known in the comics. The work represented everything that abstract expressionism was not and helped to precipitate a sea change in American art. As painter Larry Rivers suggested, ""Roy got the hand out of art, and put the brain in.""  "
90791,"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked. With this, the first line of Howl (1955), Allen Ginsberg launched the postwar counterculture’s revolt against the American consensus. Ginsberg sparked the self-styled Beat movement that took the double meaning of its name from a sense of exhaustion with postwar American triumphalism and a despairing commitment to rebel against it with a new cultural politics rooted in individual identity. Howl was also Ginsberg’s coming-out as a poet, as he put aside all his self-consciousness and allowed his unmediated voice to pour out. With Howl ""Allen finally accepted his homosexuality and stopped trying to become ‘straight’"" in all meanings of the word, noted his biographer, Bill Morgan. In a photograph by William S. Burroughs displayed in this grouping, Ginsberg presents himself as a nice, buttoned-down Jewish boy who was recently a student at Columbia. His appearance gives no indication of the internal turmoil that would result in America’s greatest long poem since Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. "
90798,"A masterful performer who has brought stunning authenticity to his roles for nearly five decades, Robert Duvall is widely regarded as one of the screen's most versatile and proficient actors. His career began in the late 1950s with roles in several off-Broadway productions and soon expanded to include guest appearances in such popular television series as The Fugitive and The Untouchables. Since making his motion picture debut in 1962 as the mute and reclusive Boo Radley in To Kill a Mockingbird, Duvall has created memorable characters in dozens of films, including M*A*S*H (1970), The Godfather (1972), Apocalypse Now (1979), The Great Santini (1979), and The Apostle (1997). A frequent Oscar nominee for his supporting roles, Duvall captured 1983 Best Actor honors for his portrayal of a washed-up country singer in Tender Mercies. He posed for this portrait at his Virginia farm."
90799,"One of the fashion industry's most successful and influential designers, Calvin Klein reinvigorated American couture in the early 1970s with his deceptively simple yet thoroughly sophisticated creations. Just twenty-six when he founded his apparel company in 1968, Klein launched his first women's sportswear collection in 1973. Featuring a muted palette and spare, clean lines, Klein's unfussy fashions set the standard for minimalist chic and earned him the prestigious Coty Award for three consecutive years (1973-75). He soon expanded his line to include more affordable clothing and sparked the popular craze for designer labels when he introduced his name-brand jeans in the late 1970s. Since that time, Klein has not only built a fashion empire encompassing everything from menswear and fragrances to eyewear and home furnishings but has also revolutionized fashion marketing with his sexually provocative print and television advertising campaigns.  "
90802,"Born Lodz, Poland  In the phrase of the day, Daniel Libeskind is a “starchitect”—one of a small number of architects who are not seen just as designers and builders but as celebrities who stamp a particular style on the times. The son of Holocaust survivors who immigrated to the United States in 1959, Libeskind came late to architecture, not building his first project until he was fifty-two; previously he had been a scholar and architectural theorist. He and his wife, Nina, founded Studio Daniel Libeskind in 1989.  Libeskind came to widespread public attention in 2003, when he was selected to rebuild at Ground Zero in New York City. Although his master plan was the winning entry, the design has been altered in practice. This 1995 Abe Frajndlich portrait showing Libeskind holding a photograph of a ruined library during World War II seems to anticipate the architect’s subsequent work rebuilding the World Trade Center site."
90804,"For more than thirty years, director Robert Altman has challenged Hollywood conventions and tweaked the public's consciousness with his innovative, provocative films. After making his start as an industrial filmmaker in the 1940s, Altman moved to television, where he worked until the mid-1960s, developing such shows as Combat and Bonanza. His big-screen directorial breakthrough came in 1970, when his feature film M*A*S*H scored a huge hit with moviegoers and critics alike. With M*A*S*H, Altman introduced many of the elements that have since become hallmarks of his unorthodox moviemaking style in such films as Nashville (1975) and Gosford Park (2001). These include a flexible script with a multifaceted storyline; a large ensemble cast that is encouraged to improvise; a richly layered soundtrack with overlapping dialogue and music that propels the plot; and wide-screen shots filled with details that vie for the viewer's attention.  "
90805,"Born New York City    Bill Viola, along with Nam June Paik, has been called one of ""the bookends"" of video artists. In this relatively new electronic art form (with a history of half a century, rather than multiple centuries), Viola explores what he calls ""the great themes in life,"" such as love and hate, birth and death, and the notion of human consciousness. ""He's taken this medium so identified with television and commercial display and made it the medium of the artist,"" said one critic. ""His choice of video as a means of expression may be his greatest achievement."" In 1998, when the Whitney Museum hosted a twenty-five-year retrospective exhibition of Viola's work, the event was billed as the largest one-man show ever devoted to a video artist, clearly establishing the medium as a central one in contemporary art. It was on this occasion that Abe Frajndlich created his portrait of Viola."
90806,"Born Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania     ""Everybody says I am shocking and provocative. So what? That should be normal. I'm an enfant terrible? Oh, please. This is what I do every day."" Often referred to as the ""bad boy"" of American theater, Peter Sellars is known for innovative stagings of classical operas and for directing contemporary operas. As a student at Harvard, Sellars staged a condensed version of Wagner's The Ring of the Nibelungs cycle with marionettes. Later, he set The Magic Flute in a fantasy landscape of Los Angeles, and staged Handel's Orlando with the hero as an astronaut set at Cape Canaveral, the Florida Everglades, and Mars. His energy and zest for innovation go hand-in-hand with his signature unkempt hair. By age twenty-six he was appointed director of the National Theater at the Kennedy Center. Still involved in theater today, Sellars is also a professor of World Arts and Cultures at UCLA."
90809,"Born Seoul, South Korea    Celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to time-based art media, Nam June Paik was a pioneer in his recognition of television and video as artistic tools. The Korean-born artist studied music in Japan and Germany during the 1950s, becoming a key participant in the international fluxus movement, which stressed liberation from traditional artistic categories, with an emphasis on performance. Combining his interest in electronic art and musical composition, Paik collaborated with John Cage and developed a longstanding artistic partnership with the cellist Charlotte Moorman, who famously performed in a ""TV bra"" created by Paik. A deep sympathy with Zen Buddhism, shared by many artists of his generation and alluded to in this playful portrait by Abe Franjndlich, informed much of Paik's art, leading to projects such as Zen for Film (1962) and TV Buddha (1974). In 2009, the Smithsonian American Art Museum became the home for Paik's archives."
90854,"Born Taichung, Taiwan  Time magazine’s ""Man of the Year"" in 1996, the Taiwanese-born scientist David Ho has distinguished himself for his major contributions to AIDS research. He is seen in Gregory Heisler’s picture looking at the blown-up image of an AIDS-infected T-cell, where the red marks the presence of the virus. Ho helped to develop therapeutic ""cocktails"" combining protease inhibitors with other antiviral medications to help those infected fight the virus in its early stages. The shift from treating late symptoms of the illness to addressing its early emergence characterizes Ho’s revolutionary approach. An immigrant to the United States as a young child, Ho credits his success in part to this experience: ""People get to this new world, and they want to carve out their place in it. The result is dedication and a higher level of work ethic. You always retain a bit of an underdog mentality."""
90855,"In 1975, Bill Gates left Harvard at the end of his sophomore year to co-found Microsoft, which began designing and selling computer operating systems. In 1980, IBM approached Gates about designing a program for a new personal computer it was developing. What emerged was Microsoft's Disk Operating System (MS-DOS), whose tremendous success transformed Microsoft into the largest software company in existence. Gates next developed the Windows operating system and began designing special applications software for financial analysis and word processing. Now, as Microsoft Corporation's chairman, Gates heads the world's leading computer software firm. Gates's astute business intuition has made him one of the world's wealthiest people. In 2000, Gates and his wife established the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has donated millions of dollars to science and to such causes as children's health and education."
90907,"A tenacious competitor with an impressive work ethic, Carlton Fisk was one of major league baseball's most capable and durable catchers. During twenty-four seasons in the American League (first with the Boston Red Sox and later with the Chicago White Sox), Fisk caught a record-setting 2,226 games and posted home-run tallies that ranked him among the top-hitting catchers of all time. Fisk's accomplishments were all the more remarkable because he repeatedly overcame career-threatening injuries. In 1975, after battling back from reconstructive knee surgery and a broken arm, Fisk gave Red Sox fans a never-to-be-forgotten thrill in the sixth game of the World Series when he drilled a twelfth-inning home run to win the game. Fisk always demanded the best not only of himself but of his teammates. As he once observed, ""You don't play baseball. . . . You work at it."""
90937,"Eleanor Holm 1913–2004  Born Brooklyn, New York  Helene Madison 1913–1970   Born Madison, Wisconsin  In its September 1932 issue, Vanity Fair reported that the U.S. women’s swim team at the recent Los Angeles Olympics had boasted ""angels who would fit into a Ziegfeld chorus."" In support of that declaration on the opposite page was this photograph of Eleanor Holm (standing) and Helene Madison (sitting). Comeliness, however, was the least of this pair’s story. Holm, who had in fact once turned down an invitation to be a Ziegfeld girl, claimed thirty-five U.S. swimming championships between 1927 and 1936, and at Los Angeles she had taken gold in the backstroke. Madison, a ten-time record holder in the freestyle, was not to be outdone, winning three gold medals of her own.  Edward Steichen’s picture of Holm and Madison testifies to the brilliant sense of design that shaped much of his work. "
90938,"In highly original compositions for the musical stage and the concert hall, George Gershwin captured the vibrant spirit of the jazz age like no other American composer. A precocious talent, Gershwin began writing music in his teens. At twenty-one, he produced his first hit song-""Swanee""-and completed his first Broadway score. His musical-theater credits soon included such hits as Oh, Kay! (1926), Funny Face (1927), and Girl Crazy (1930). In 1924, Gershwin introduced the jazz idiom to the concert hall with his groundbreaking Rhapsody in Blue, a work immediately hailed as a modern classic. His commitment to serious composition continued with his Concerto in F (1925) and An American in Paris (1928), reaching its culmination with the premier of his opera Porgy and Bess in 1935. Gershwin died just two years later, after completing the score for his first Hollywood film, Shall We Dance."
90939,"Leading lady Katharine Cornell was a dominant presence on the American stage for more than a quarter century. With the exception of her acclaimed performance in the title role of George Bernard Shaw's Candida (1924), Cornell spent her first decade on Broadway, starring in popular yet largely forgettable melodramas. Eager to expand the scope of her repertoire, Cornell entered a new phase of her career in the 1930s with her memorable portrayals of Elizabeth Barrett Browning in The Barretts of Wimpole Street and Shakespeare's Juliet. Believing that audiences everywhere deserved to experience first-rate theatrical productions, she took her company on tour to seventy-seven communities in thirty-one states during the midst of the Great Depression.  As Steichen's portrait suggests, Cornell was not a conventional beauty but a striking woman whose dark hair, soulful eyes, and highly expressive face could prove mesmerizing."
90940,"Widely regarded as the twentieth century's most brilliant violinist, Jascha Heifetz gave his first public performance at the age of five. He already enjoyed an international reputation by 1917 when, at age sixteen, he made his triumphant Carnegie Hall debut. From the beginning, his playing encompassed superb musicianship, technical perfection, and ravishing sound-qualities that marked Heifetz as a virtuoso and remained undiminished throughout his long career. His consummate skill made performing look easy, but Heifetz always insisted that hard work and constant practice were essential to his success.  Steichen's portrait captures Heifetz much as he was described by noted musicologist Boris Schwarz, who noted, ""the immobile presence, the unsmiling face, . . . the violin held high and pushed far back, the bow arm with the elbow angled up. A minimum of fuss which disguised a maximum of self-discipline."""
90941,"A torch singer whose voice conveyed the heartbreak and longing of a shopworn angel, Helen Morgan began her career in the Chicago cabarets and speakeasies that flourished during Prohibition. She made her New York stage debut in the chorus of Florenz Ziegfeld's Sally in 1920 and went on to appear in a string of musicals and revues, including George White's Scandals of 1925. Between theatrical engagements, Morgan performed in popular nightspots such as Billy Rose's Backstage Club, where she developed her trademark pose of perching atop the piano in order to be seen above the crowd. In 1927 she created a sensation on Broadway in Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's Show Boat. Appearing as Julie, a role she would reprise in the 1936 film version of the musical, Morgan enthralled audiences when she sang ""Bill"" and ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man."""
90942,"Character actress, comedienne, and self-styled ""ugly duckling,"" Marie Dressler delighted theatergoers for decades with her lively performances in comedies, musicals, burlesques, and vaudeville. In 1914 she scored a hit opposite Charlie Chaplin in her first film, but her career disintegrated two years later when she was deemed too old to appeal to modern audiences. Dressler struggled to find work for more than a decade before landing bit parts in several films. Her Hollywood breakthrough came in 1930-at the age of sixty-one-with her acclaimed performance in Eugene O'Neill's drama Anna Christie. The next year she won the Academy Award for Best Actress for Min and Bill.  When Dressler posed for Steichen's camera in 1933, she topped popularity polls as the biggest box-office draw, thanks in large measure to her memorable screen appearances that year in Tugboat Annie, Dinner at Eight, and The Late Christopher Bean."
90943,"Widely credited with originating the modern celebrity gossip column, tabloid journalist Walter Winchell enjoyed unrivaled popularity from the late 1920s to the early 1950s. After brief associations with Billboard, the Vaudeville News, and the sensation-mongering Evening Graphic, Winchell signed with William Randolph Hearst's Daily Mirror in 1929 to write a column entitled ""On Broadway."" Gleaning gossipy tidbits from a variety of sources, Winchell delivered show business and political ""scoops,"" pointed opinion, and innuendo in staccato phrases that carried the urgency of news flashes. Syndicated and read by millions across the nation, who took his column as gospel, Winchell had an extraordinary ability to influence popular opinion.  When this photograph appeared in Vanity Fair, the accompanying caption observed, ""Mr. Winchell has become a national phenomenon, a hear-all, see-all, tell-all with a vast volunteer spy system. His wise and terrible eye is everywhere."""
90944,"Sherwood Anderson began writing fiction around 1909, largely as an antidote to an unsatisfying business career. After a breakdown in 1912, he moved to Chicago, where he joined the Chicago Renaissance-a flourishing cultural movement whose members included writer Theodore Dreiser and poet Carl Sandburg. During a period of great creativity from 1916 to 1925, Anderson drew upon his personal knowledge of small-town Midwestern life in crafting acclaimed works such as Winesburg, Ohio (1919), The Triumph of the Egg (1921), and Horses and Men (1923). At the peak of his popularity, Anderson was hailed by editor and critic H. L. Mencken as ""America's most distinctive novelist,"" but after 1925 he was surpassed by other writers of his generation. Anderson's best works remain those whose compelling narratives evoke the anxiety and alienation brought on by America's transition from an agricultural to an industrial society.   "
90945,"Born Back Creek Valley (now Gore), Virginia  Willa Cather never got over her traumatic childhood move from Virginia to the flat, treeless expanses of the Nebraska plains, and when she returned as an adult to Nebraska, she often could not wait to leave ""for fear of dying in a cornfield."" Yet as a novelist, she found her most important subject matter in the pioneer experience of the Great Plains. When her book O Pioneers! appeared in 1913, one critic called it the ""most vital, subtle . . . piece of the year’s fiction."" Many of her subsequent efforts—among them My Ántonia, A Lost Lady, and One of Ours—were greeted with similar accolades.  Shortly after this picture ran in Vanity Fair, Cather published Death Comes to the Archbishop, and in the face of its warm reception, the magazine featured another likeness of her, this time billing her as ""heir apparent"" to Edith Wharton. "
90946,"In the mid-1920s, photographer Edward Steichen captured the Meyer family at their summer home in Mount Kisco, New York. The large country estate known as ""the farm"" included an indoor pool, bowling alley, tennis court, horses, orchards, and gardens. The five Meyer children-raised primarily in the company of nannies and governesses-had more time here with their parents than elsewhere, although Graham later wrote that her mother thought ""perhaps we should make appointments"" to meet with her. Agnes Meyer set ""impossibly high standards for us,"" yet Graham later wrote that ""with all her complexity, I felt closer throughout my early childhood to my mother"" than to her more distant father. Still, Eugene Meyer somehow conveyed his belief in her: ""that was the single most sustaining thing in my life. That was what saved me."""
90948,"One of the twentieth century's leading editorial journalists, Walter Lippmann brought ""reason, clarity, and ethics to the tumult and intrigues of politics."" After launching his career as a muckraking journalist for Everybody's Magazine (1910), Lippmann became a founding editor of the liberal New Republic (1914). During World War I, he took a hiatus from journalism and played a critical role in formulating portions of President Wilson's ill-fated plan for lasting peace. After the war, Lippmann began a regular column for Vanity Fair and in 1922 joined the editorial staff of the crusading New York World. In 1931 he moved to the New York Herald Tribune, where he established his widely syndicated column ""Today and Tomorrow."" Serving as a forum in which the independent-minded Lippmann could freely express his views, the Pulitzer Prize-winning column cemented his reputation as an astute observer and critic of world affairs. "
90949,"When the vogue for celebrity caricature was at its zenith in the 1920s and 1930s, Mexican-born artist Miguel Covarrubias ranked as one of the genre's most inventive and witty practitioners. Although he was only eighteen when he arrived in New York in 1923, Covarrubias quickly made connections among the leaders of the art world. A grouping of his distinctive and disarming caricatures debuted in Vanity Fair in January 1924 under the heading, ""A Pungent Page of Character Studies from the Pen of a Newcomer."" Covarrubias published a collection of sixty-six of his celebrity caricatures the following year in the humorously titled volume The Prince of Wales and Other Famous Americans, and from that moment his popularity grew exponentially. His caricatures remained a fixture in Vanity Fair and in numerous other venues until the mid-1930s, when a consuming interest in anthropological and ethnological studies eclipsed Covarrubias's commitment to the art of caricature. "
90951,"A member of one of America's most illustrious theatrical families, John Barrymore won critical and popular acclaim as a star of both stage and screen. The charismatic and mercurial actor made his Broadway debut in 1903 and for more than a decade appeared mostly in comedies before turning to serious drama. Well-received in his first Shakespearean role as Richard III (1920), Barrymore scored his greatest triumph in 1922 with a moving portrayal of Hamlet, which Steichen documents here. His motion picture career began in earnest with the release of the silent classic Beau Brummel (1924) and continued unabated into talking pictures, with memorable performances in such films as Grand Hotel (1932), A Bill of Divorcement (1932), and Dinner at Eight (1933). Sadly, alcoholism took a devastating toll on Barrymore's career and resulted in his death at the age of sixty."
90952,"You want to pack 'em out in front?/ Hire Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt. So quipped writer Ring Lardner of the man and woman who for nearly forty years were the most celebrated couple of the American stage. Married in 1922, Lunt and Fontanne excelled at urbane comedy, but they were equally adept in more serious drama. Although each achieved success pursuing a separate career, they found that their acting styles complemented one another, and in 1928 they formalized an arrangement with Broadway's Theatre Guild stipulating that they must always act together. Critic Brooks Atkinson once described the pair as ""stylists of the first rank,"" and it was said that together they could make even the thinnest of plays work.   For this portrait, Steichen photographed Lunt and Fontanne in the guise of Comedy and Tragedy, and evoked the effect of footlights through his imaginative lighting scheme.  "
90953,"A giant in the field of city planning, Robert Moses had ""a genius for getting things done."" He began his career in 1913 as a civil service reformer in New York City. Impatient with old-style politics, Moses reasoned that by mastering the increasingly complex machinery of government, he could realize his vision of a modern city. He never held elective office, but as an appointed city commissioner and an influential member of numerous municipal boards, Moses spearheaded extensive highway construction, built bridges to link the city with its suburbs, and supervised scores of ambitious projects-from parks development to slum clearance. Above all, he built a new type of city government by encouraging the transfer of power from politicians to professional planners and managers. Intolerant of opposition, Moses saw his influence disintegrate in the 1960s when his autocratic ways proved unacceptable to city and state officials."
90954,"Already well established as musical theater's ""fleetest of jazz steppers,"" Fred Astaire was starring on Broadway in Funny Face when he posed for this image. The dancer-actor would achieve his greatest fame in the 1930s, when he went to Hollywood to make movie musicals and teamed up with Ginger Rogers. Starring together in such confections as The Gay Divorcee, Top Hat, and Shall We Dance, Astaire and Rogers brought a romantic glamour to their films that was uniquely their own, and their silver-screen elegance provided moviegoers with a much-welcomed escape from the gray realities of the Depression. Astaire had a genius for making his dancing seem effortless, but behind the finished performance, he said, were long days of experimenting that often produced ""nothing but exhaustion.""   By transforming Astaire's signature top hat into a recurring motif, Steichen offers a clever visual reference to his subject's style and sophistication."
90956,"Prior to becoming chief photographer for Condé Nast Publications in 1923, Edward Steichen had never worked with anything but natural light. When an electrician armed with floodlights, reflectors, and other exotic equipment joined the photographer for one of his first assignments, Steichen improvised rather than admitting he had no experience with artificial lighting. His instincts proved excellent, however, and the electrician came away from the session convinced that the photographer was truly an innovative professional. Steichen soon grew to regard electric lighting as an essential tool in bringing variety to his compositions. In the later years of his work for Vanity Fair, Steichen recalled that he had ""lights going all over the place,"" as evidenced in this self-portrait."
90957,"Charlie Chaplin was one of the cinema's first stars. Discovered in 1913 by producer Mack Sennett, the head of Keystone Studios, Chaplin achieved unprecedented popular and financial success during film's silent era. His creation of the Tramp-a screen persona that combined comedy with endearing pathos-won him great acclaim during his first years with Sennett, and he returned to this character repeatedly over his career. Such popularity also allowed him to create, direct, and act in his own films, independent from the major studios' control. The resulting motion pictures consistently broke new ground in this burgeoning industry. Sensitive to the events of the day, Chaplin made films that satirized contemporary society and politics, including Modern Times (1936) and The Great Dictator (1940).   Steichen counted Chaplin among his favorite subjects and described this engaging portrait as ""the image of a dancing faun."""
90958,"Alternately hailed as a genius or dismissed as a showman, conductor Leopold Stokowski was an innovative and controversial figure during nearly seven decades on the podium. As leader of the Philadelphia Orchestra (1912-36), he transformed the previously undistinguished ensemble into a world-class orchestra esteemed for the incredible warmth and fullness of its sound. Stokowski consistently championed modern composers and conducted the American premiers of works by Rachmaninoff, Mahler, Stravinsky, and Schoenberg. He angered traditionalists, however, with his transcriptions for orchestra of works by Bach and his freewheeling interpretations of canonical works by other revered composers. Stokowski was a pioneer in the field of high-fidelity orchestral recording, and his collaboration with Walt Disney on the film Fantasia (1940) is credited with doing much to foster popular appreciation of classical compositions. ""A storyteller in music,"" Stokowski never lost the power to excite audiences."
90959,"A public-spirited woman of enormous energy and strong convictions, Agnes Ernst Meyer immersed herself in pursuits ranging from journalism and art scholarship to public education and social reform. In 1907 she became the New York Sun's first woman reporter, and met Edward Steichen while covering the arts for that newspaper. She and her future husband, financier Eugene Meyer, would become Steichen's great patrons and friends. An early champion of the artistic avant-garde, Agnes Meyer was also a devotee of Asian art-a passion she shared with her friend Charles Freer, whose Freer Gallery she nurtured. After her husband purchased the Washington Post in 1933, Meyer returned to journalism and earned recognition for her hard-hitting articles. In 1944 she and her husband established the Eugene and Agnes E. Meyer Foundation to fund initiatives in a number of fields, including the arts and humanities, education, health, and community service."
90960,"Born Allegheny City, Pennsylvania  A pioneer of modern dance in America, Martha Graham brought dance into the vortex of the Machine Age. The idea of motion and dynamism were fundamental tenets of modernism, as was the quest to “make it new.” In this spirit, Graham saw herself as both “a dancer and an inventor.”  She studied at Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn’s Denishawn School from 1916 to 1923 and then worked as a solo dancer at the Greenwich Village Follies. She also taught at the Eastman School and, with some of her students, established the Martha Graham School for Contemporary Dance in 1926.  In her 1944 signature piece, Appalachian Spring, she presented a “quintessentially American” scenario that conveyed “a dance of hope.” It was a perfect vehicle for Graham, who once described dancing as “an affirmation of life through movement.”"
91108,"Born Culpeper, Virginia  General Ambrose Powell Hill’s fleet, hard-hitting attacks in Virginia during the Peninsula Campaign, Cedar Mountain, Second Manassas, and especially his counterattack at Antietam, Maryland (all in 1862), earned his command the proud sobriquet of the Light Division. At Chancellorsville in May 1863, Hill aptly stepped in for his chief, Stonewall Jackson, after Jackson suffered the fatal wound that would prompt Robert E. Lee to reorganize his army. Hill was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of the newly created Third Corps. Ill health, however, plagued him at critical moments during the war and too often left him incapacitated.  This popular image was originally taken by Julian Vannerson around 1864. Vannerson’s photograph, copied here by George S. Cook, was most likely the last one of Hill to have been taken before his death at the end of the war, in April 1865."
91111,"Born Lancaster, Pennsylvania     Barbara Frietchie has been a legendary national heroine ever since John Greenleaf Whittier published a poem about her in the Atlantic Monthly in October 1863. According to Whittier's famous verse, in September 1862 Frietchie waved the American flag from her house in full view of Confederate general Stonewall Jackson as he marched his troops down her street in Frederick, Maryland. Jackson was so impressed with Frietchie's courage that he ordered his men not to harm either the ninety-six-year-old woman or her flag. In reality, however, the story of Barbara Frietchie has little historical basis; Jackson most likely never rode past Frietchie's house. Nevertheless, her reputation as a Union patriot has become firmly entrenched in Civil War lore.  "
91112,"Born Lancaster, Pennsylvania   Barbara Frietchie has been a legendary national heroine ever since John Greenleaf Whittier published a poem about her in the October 1863 issue of Atlantic Monthly. According to Whittier’s famous verse, Frietchie is said to have waved the American flag from her house in full view of General Stonewall Jackson as he marched his Confederate troops down her street in Frederick, Maryland, in September 1862, before the Battle of Antietam. Jackson was so impressed with Frietchie’s courage that he ordered his men not to harm either the ninety-six-year-old woman or her flag. In reality, however, the story has little historical basis; Jackson most likely never rode past her house. Nevertheless, Frietchie’s reputation as a spunky Union patriot has become a firmly entrenched part of Civil War lore."
91114,"American jazz composer and trumpeter Miles Davis, the ""Picasso of Jazz,"" was one of the most influential and pioneering musicians of his time and beyond. Constantly reinventing his sound, Davis journeyed through numerous periods, including sessions with John Coltrane and others in the Miles Davis Quintet (1948-50). This collaboration gave birth to cool jazz, a major trend that emphasized Davis's melodic playing style. Following heroin withdrawal in 1954, Davis exploded back on the scene in a matchless stint of creativity. During this time he adopted the Harmon mute, whose unique soft buzzing sound he unveiled at the 1955 Newport Jazz Festival. In the late 1960s Davis replaced the quintet with an electric rock band and produced two revolutionary albums, In a Silent Way and Bitches Brew, which represent a blend of jazz and rock known as fusion.  "
91115,"How can it be possible that apartheid [in South Africa] still exists? Dr. King was speaking against it 20 years ago, wrote artist Keith Haring in exasperation in 1988. Martin Roy's photograph pictures Haring on a New York City subway platform posing beside one of his celebrated white chalk drawings. In this and other works during a meteoric career that lasted just over a decade, Haring demonstrated a commitment to various political and social causes, including apartheid, nuclear disarmament, and especially the AIDS crisis. Although some art critics expressed concern about his efforts to market his work to a mass audience, Haring believed that art should be as accessible as possible: ""You can't just stay in your studio and paint; that's not the most effective way to communicate."""
91123,"The trouble with Bogart, said director John Huston, ""is he thinks he's Bogart."" Shown here on his beloved yacht, Santana, Humphrey Bogart had just won a Best Actor Oscar as the boozy riverboat skipper Charlie Allnut in The African Queen. This film portrayal showcased Bogart's evolution as an actor. In the thirties, he was typecast as a gangster-along with Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, and George Raft-on Warner Brothers' ""Murderers' Row."" Then, sparked by breakout performances in High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon in 1941, Bogart perfected his sensitive tough-guy persona in Casablanca, To Have and Have Not, The Big Sleep, and Key Largo. He won a second Best Actor Oscar in 1954 as Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny, and has been ranked number one on the American Film Institute's list of the greatest screen actors.  "
91126,"For four decades, Dean Martin oozed a cool nonchalance on radio, television, recordings, movie screens, and Las Vegas stages. Lucille Ball once told him, ""You know, you make cooked spaghetti look tense."" From 1946 to 1956 he teamed with Jerry Lewis in a loony comedy act that made both of them stars. After they split, Martin enjoyed a respectable solo movie career in The Young Lions and Rio Bravo and recorded such hits as ""That's Amore"" and ""Everybody Loves Somebody Sometime."" He was known as the ""clown prince"" of the Rat Pack, a Hollywood clan chaired by Frank Sinatra and including Sammy Davis Jr. and Peter Lawford. From 1965 to 1973, he hosted the popular Dean Martin Show on television.  "
91132,"Born London, England    Few child actors have made the transition to adult roles as successfully as Elizabeth Taylor.   Just twelve years old when she enchanted audiences as the star of National Velvet (1944), Taylor progressed rapidly through juvenile parts and made her grown-up debut as Spencer Tracy's daughter in the comedy Father of the Bride (1950). Taylor's increasingly mature roles in A Place in the Sun (1951) and Giant (1955) showcased her dramatic range while underscoring her sensual appeal. At the zenith of her film career, from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, she excelled in portraying emotionally troubled women and twice won the Academy Award for Best Actress-in Butterfield 8 (1960) and Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? (1966). With time, the melodramas that played out in Taylor's personal life came to rival her performances on screen, until her achievements as a dramatic actress were largely overshadowed by the magnitude of her celebrity."
91314,"Born Monroe, Louisiana  Born in Louisiana, Huey Newton was named after the populist firebrand governor of the state, Huey Long, and he did his best during a tempestuous—and sometimes violent—political career to live up to his namesake’s reputation. The Newton family moved to the San Francisco Bay area in 1945, and Oakland would always be Huey Newton’s home and the center for his political activities. As a college student, Newton co-founded the Black Panther Party with Bobby Seale in 1966; Newton was the party’s minister of defense. The Panthers represented the split in the civil rights movement that was emerging as a younger, more militant generation became politically conscious and active. The Panthers preached community organization and self-defense, and expressed contempt for older civil rights groups like the NAACP. Violence stalked Newton from his days as a street criminal to his ultimate killing by a rival political group."
91315,"Frustrated by what they regarded as slow progress in the struggle for equality and angered by the repressive tactics employed by civil rights opponents, Stokely Carmichael and H. Rap Brown emerged in the mid-1960s as leaders of an increasingly militant faction of activists who called for black autonomy rather than integration. Carmichael's experiences as a Freedom Rider in the 1961 campaign to desegregate interstate transportation in the South and his subsequent work as a field organizer with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) fueled his decision to abandon the long-favored tactic of passive resistance. Adopting ""Black Power"" as a rallying cry, Carmichael broke with SNCC and accepted a leadership role with the separatist Black Panther Party. He was soon joined by SNCC veteran H. Rap Brown, whose claim that ""violence is as American as cherry pie"" signaled a radical schism within the civil rights movement. "
91352,"Sculptor Marisol Escobar first achieved critical success in the 1960s with work that drew upon traditions ranging from pre-Columbian art and the folk arts of South America to the works of Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. Infusing her work with her own considerable penchant for satiric whimsy, she created expressionistic figural pieces that offered wry commentaries on contemporary life. Among her most notable portraits are her droll, toy-like renderings of public figures, including Lyndon Johnson, John Wayne, and Hugh Hefner.    Fred McDarrah's portrait of Marisol captures the sculptor amidst her assemblage The Party on the eve of her one-woman exhibition at the prestigious Sidney Janis Gallery. Standing directly behind one of the painted woodblock bodies, she becomes in this photograph a living part of this semi-autobiographical work. Meant to satirize the fashionable New York art world, The Party was the centerpiece of an exhibition that drew record crowds and celebratory reviews."
91353,"Best known for her paintings of the ""human creature""-she disliked the term ""portrait""-Alice Neel spent more than fifty years working as an artist in New York. For much of her career she received little recognition for the expressive and penetrating likenesses that she created of friends and acquaintances from her Spanish Harlem neighborhood. Described as ""the quintessential bohemian,"" she was an artist with a strong social conscience whose work displayed compassion for the disenfranchised and an awareness of contemporary politics. Beginning in the 1960s-around the time that Fred McDarrah created this portrait in her studio-Neel began to gain wider notice. After years in which portraiture was ignored in favor of non-figurative work within the New York art world, Neel helped to bring renewed attention to the creative possibilities of this long-important artistic genre."
91354,"In the fall of 1969, Kate Millett was settled into the relatively normal life of an academic, teaching at Barnard College and looking forward to defending her doctoral thesis in a few months. Her life, however, changed suddenly in the summer of 1970, when her thesis, Sexual Politics, was published. Premised on the argument that masculine dominance and feminine subservience in society did not reflect the natural order, the book became an immediate best-seller and the bible of the burgeoning feminist movement.  Fred McDarrah's portrait shows the thirty-five-year-old author marching down New York's Fifth Avenue during a parade in 1970 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment. Later, at a rally in Bryant Park, Millett spoke before an exuberant crowd, exclaiming ""today is the end of millenniums of oppression."""
91355,"A longtime supporter of a host of causes from civil rights to nuclear disarmament, Bella Abzug became deeply involved in the 1960s in organizing political opposition to the Vietnam War. Elected to Congress from New York City in 1970, she quickly made her presence known in Washington with her outspoken criticism of the war and strong advocacy of women’s rights. Her booming voice and no-holds-barred New York style were considered unusual, especially in a first-term member of Congress. But she remained unrelenting, and in the turbulent politics of the early 1970s, sporting her trademark broad-brimmed hat, she emerged as a symbol of the growing visibility of women in the political arena.              In 1977, following a failed try for the U.S. Senate, Abzug set her sights on becoming mayor of New York City, and she is seen in this picture at a rally promoting her candidacy. She lost out in the Democratic primary to Ed Koch but, not ready to admit that this defeat probably meant that her office-seeking days were over, she told reporters, “I’ll thank you not to write my obituary.”   In her final years, Abzug founded and led the UN non-governmental organization Women’s Environmental Development Organization (WEDO)."
91357,"The scholar, educator, and political activist Angela Davis was the nation’s most iconic revolutionary for a generation. Davis taught philosophy at UCLA as the Black Power movement intensified. She owned the guns used in an infamous courtroom shoot-out meant to liberate the Black Panther George Jackson. This 1970 incident left four people dead, and Davis became a fugitive, appearing on the FBI’s Ten Most Wanted List. Her two-year incarceration led to a ""Free Angela"" campaign, and her eventual trial and acquittal made international headlines. In 1972 John Lennon recorded ""Angela""—referring to Davis as a political prisoner and ""people teacher""—while the Rolling Stones dedicated ""Sweet Black Angel"" to her. In Blues Legacies and Black Feminism (1999), she located the origins of black feminist empowerment in the songs of Bessie Smith and Billie Holiday. Her Afro has always been a symbol of black pride and, as shown here, an example of cultural politics through style."
91410,"Inexpensive silhouettes were a popular form of portraiture from about 1790 to 1840, when the invention of photography made them obsolete. Englishman William Bache, who compiled this sample book of 1,846 silhouettes that he had made in America, came to New Orleans in about 1803, after working first in Philadelphia. The cut portraits that he made in this southern city included those of the last Spanish military governor of the Louisiana Territory, Sebastian Calvo de la Puerta, Marquess of Casa Calvo; the new governor of the American territory, William, C. C. Claiborne; artist Ambrose Duval; numerous New Orleans tradespeople, civil servants, and their families; as well as portraits of African Americans, who comprised a large part of the population.    Gracias a su bajo costo, la silueta fue una forma popular de retrato aproximadamente entre 1790 y 1840, cuando la invención de la fotografía la desplazó. William Bache, el inglés que recopiló este muestrario de 1.846 siluetas suyas confeccionadas en América, fue a Nueva Orleans allá por 1803, después de haber trabajado en Filadelfia. Los retratos que hizo en aquella ciudad sureña incluyeron al último gobernador militar español de la Luisiana, Sebastián Calvo de la Puerta y O'Farrill, Marqués de Casa Calvo; al gobernador del nuevo territorio estadounidense, William C.C. Claiborne; al artista Ambrose Duval; a numerosos comerciantes, funcionarios públicos y sus familias de Nueva Orleáns, sin olvidar a los afroamericanos, quienes constituían una gran parte de la población. "
91413,"This small drawing gives us clues to Elaine’s process in thinking through a portrait. On the left is a drawing of Willem de Kooning (1904–1997) with his body turned slightly to the side. Later she used this sheet to create a compositional study and precise drawing for her large painted portrait of the writer and critic Harold Rosenberg (1906–1978), also included in this exhibition. This drawing clearly delineates the studio window behind Rosenberg’s stretched-out figure, as well as the door in the right background, and captures the precise way in which he holds a cigarette in his left hand and a can in his right. These details remain in the larger painting, but they are surrounded by gestural strokes and dripping areas of pure color.  Este pequeño dibujo nos ofrece indicios sobre la manera en que Elaine razonaba sus retratos. A la izquierda aparece Willem de Kooning (1904–1997) con el cuerpo ligeramente girado hacia un lado. Ella usó luego esta página para crear un estudio compositivo y un dibujo más preciso que sirvieron de base a su pintura en gran formato del escritor y crítico Harold Rosenberg (1906–1978), incluida también en esta exposición. Este dibujo delinea con claridad la ventana del estudio detrás de la figura recostada de Rosenberg, así como la puerta del fondo a la derecha; también capta la manera específica en que Rosenberg sostiene su cigarrillo en la mano izquierda y una lata en la derecha. Estos detalles se conservan en la pintura, pero rodeados de pinceladas gestuales y áreas de salpicaduras de color puro."
91722,"As an artist, Raphael Soyer remained loyal to the realist tradition and to his passion for depicting the human texture of modern life, especially as he encountered it on the streets of his home, New York City. He was never tempted to experiment with the various forms of abstraction that became current during his long career. Of the American artists who chose this traditional course in the twentieth century, he easily ranks among the most respected.    Soyer posed for Rhoda Sherbell for a week in 1967; he was a very small man, and the artist emphasized his slight, almost birdlike quality in the sculpture.  "
92195,"Violinist Maud Powell was a child prodigy who gave her first public performance when she was eight. After study in Leipzig, Paris, and Berlin, she became well known through solo performances at orchestral concerts in Europe and the United States. In 1894 she formed the Maud Powell String Quartet, which debuted at Carnegie Hall. That year she also became the first instrumentalist to record for the Victor Talking Machine Company on the prestigious Red Seal label. Between 1905 and 1919 she made more than seventy recordings, which have recently been re-released. When Powell came to sit for this portrait, she brought her 1775 Guadagnini violin and suggested that the artist arrange ""an unconventional costume."" He selected a gown that had belonged to an opera star, and noted that ""of course, the violin with its beautiful red color had to be in the picture."" "
92209,"Georgia O'Keeffe's pastel portrait honors Beauford Delaney's perseverance and courage in the face of difficulty. As a gay black painter, Delaney faced many challenges, impeded by sexual, cultural, and racial stereotyping and eventually beset by psychological problems. Born in Knoxville, Tennessee, Delaney studied in Boston and then settled in New York City before his final migration to Paris. In Greenwich Village and Harlem, Delaney befriended musicians and writers and was introduced to artists, including Georgia O'Keeffe. Although portraiture is rare in her work, O'Keeffe greatly admired Delaney and found him attractive: ""dark-clean-really beautiful."" She rendered her subject in much the same manner as her still lifes of bones, rocks, or flowers. Isolating Delaney's profile against a neutral background, she used minute tonal gradations and beautifully blended pastels to create a powerful, timeless symbol of human endeavor."
92210,"Born Queen Anne’s County, Maryland  This meticulously rendered portrait depicts the accomplished artist, naturalist, engineer, and museum-founder Charles Willson Peale. Committed to the Revolutionary cause, Peale, who fought alongside George Washington, painted more than a thousand portraits of major American political and cultural figures. Peale’s museum, which included the skeleton of a mastodon he helped exhume, attained scientific recognition and international fame. Late in life, Peale even became a dentist, pioneering in America the use of porcelain for false teeth.  The delicate details of this drawing were copied from an 1807 profile engraving by Charles Balthazar Julien Févret de Saint-Mémin. The artist is most likely Peale’s youngest son Titian Ramsay Peale II (1799–1885). Like his siblings, Titian expanded upon the scientific and artistic pursuits of his father and, as a budding naturalist and illustrator, demonstrates here the close observation and precise hatching that would characterize his ornithological and entomological sketches.

92960,"Amelia Earhart and Female Beauty  Earhart was known to have been sensitive about her appearance and the clothes she wore. Given the limited space and the awkward design of the planes of this period, she always wore pants when flying—which prompted comment from those who believed pants to be unladylike. For public appearances, though, she abandoned her leather jacket, flight pants, and boots and presented herself in a fashion consistent with traditional femininity. In this 1932 drawing by Philadelphia artist Edith Emerson, Earhart appears as an exemplar of conventional female beauty. Emerson was a noted portraitist and muralist who had been educated at several of America’s leading art schools. The only hint of Earhart’s piloting fame is the faint outline of an airplane in the top left-hand corner."
93072,"Nelson Miles spent more than four decades in the U.S. military, rising from the rank of first lieutenant during the early years of the Civil War to commander in chief of the army in 1895 and the rarely attained rank of lieutenant general in 1900. Despite having been wounded on several occasions during the Civil War, Miles went on to play a prominent role in military campaigns against tribal nations in the American West. His command was responsible for forcing the surrender of such well-known leaders as Sitting Bull, Joseph, and Geronimo-all front-page news events. In 1894 he also led the troops responsible for quelling the Pullman railroad car strike in Chicago. This photograph, which served as the frontispiece for Miles's autobiography, captures his characteristic formality in dress and bearing."
93073,"In 1871, in an effort to raise funds for the Fisk University, a newly founded African American school in Nashville, Tennessee, a student singing group was formed, soon to be called the Fisk Jubilee Singers. The group, composed mostly of former slaves, became instantly popular, and their concert tours were soon raising substantial amounts of money. They appeared at the White House before President Ulysses S. Grant; toured the British Isles, where they performed before for Queen Victoria; and raised enough money to finance Fisk's first permanent building, Jubilee Hall."
93075,"Born Cincinnati, Ohio    During his twenty-six-year baseball career (1960-86), Pete Rose, known as ""Charlie Hustle,"" distinguished himself with numerous records, including most career hits (4,256) and an extraordinary versatility in the field, where he played more positions than any other player in baseball history. ""I learned at an early age how important it is to win,"" Rose recalls. Andy Warhol's 1985 screenprint commemorates Rose's shattering of Ty Cobb's longstanding record of career hits. Modeled on a baseball card, Warhol's portrait depicts the Cincinnati Reds' star, a switch-hitter, poised to fire one of his record-breaking hits; the circular Reds logo suggests the ball with which the bat will connect. However, the celebratory tone of this image would be marred in 1989, when Rose violated baseball's rules regarding player gambling. As a result, he was banished from baseball for life, and has never been elected to the Hall of Fame. "
93076,"In 1805, while stationed in St. Louis, Missouri, Zebulon Pike led a small expedition through the upper Mississippi region, hoping to discover the source of the Mississippi River. His maps and journals became the first printed account of the land newly acquired in the Louisiana Purchase. Pike's second assignment sent him south and west, searching for the headwaters of the Red and Arkansas rivers. It was during this expedition that he tried unsuccessfully to scale the Colorado peak that was named after him. After his promotion to brigadier general in 1813, Pike was fatally wounded while leading the successful attack of York, Canada, during the War of 1812. This print, based on an 1808 oil portrait by Charles Willson Peale, supplied the demand for his image. Pike's explorations made him famous, but his death made him a hero to many Americans. "
93077,"In 1984, Elaine de Kooning reflected on her early years in New York City and the talented people she and Willem de Kooning encountered: ""I didn’t know then that I had somehow made my way to the red-hot center."" Elaine loved to be with people, often other artists, and spent many evenings at the Cedar Bar in lower Manhattan. This photograph depicts her in conversation with two good friends, the poet Frank O’Hara (1926–1966) and the painter Franz Kline (1910–1962).  En 1984 Elaine de Kooning comentó lo siguiente acerca de sus primeros años en Nueva York y el grupo de gente talentosa que ella y Willem de Kooning conocieron: “En ese momento no sabía que había logrado llegar al centro candente del momento”. Le encantaba socializar, a menudo con otros artistas, y pasó muchas noches en el Cedar Bar del Bajo Manhattan. En esta fotografía aparece conversando con dos buenos amigos, el poeta Frank O’Hara (1926–1966) y el pintor Franz Kline (1910–1962)."
93081,"Coleman Hawkins transformed the tenor saxophone into one of the signature instruments in jazz. Once regarded as a comic instrument, the saxophone became, in Hawkins's hands, the centerpiece for explorations in this musical tradition. Hawkins first began playing the saxophone at age nine. He moved to New York City in 1923, where he found work with the Fletcher Henderson group. Influenced by trumpeter Louis Armstrong, he pioneered a form of improvisation based on chords rather than melody. By the time he recorded his famous ""Body and Soul"" in 1939, Hawkins was recognized as the premier saxophonist in jazz and a hero to a new generation of musicians. An international celebrity, he traveled widely in North America and Europe and continued to experiment with his instrument's creative possibilities until his death."
93082,"Earl Hines was given the nickname ""Fatha"" by a Chicago disc jockey in part because of his genial, fatherly personality, but also in tribute to Hines as the progenitor of modern jazz piano. Playing hornlike lines with one hand and chords with the other, Hines elevated the role of the piano as a solo instrument and, in the process, became the most influential jazz pianist of his generation. A church organist as a child, he resettled in 1924 in Chicago, where his playing partners included trumpeter Louis Armstrong. Shortly thereafter, he formed his own big band, which performed regularly at the Grand Terrace Ballroom and toured throughout North America and later Europe and Russia. During the 1940s, when bebop was transforming jazz with its fast tempos and improvisation, Hines's band continued to grow, nurturing new talent that included trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and saxophonist Charlie Parker."
93084,"Ben Shahn, a painter, photographer, and graphic artist, infused his works with a passion that made them both works of art and political statements. In 1932 he created a famous series on the Italian-American anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti, whose trial was widely criticized for its denial of due process. Shahn, a staunch New Dealer, painted murals and did other commissions for the government arts and public works programs. In this photograph by Ronny Jaques, Shahn, a strong supporter of labor, is shown with his poster, commissioned by the Congress of Industrial Organizations, urging workers to register to vote. Shahn's later work became more abstract and allegorical, although still politically charged, and in his last years he turned to religious themes, creating illustrated versions of books from scripture and the Torah."
93085,"Reagan at Rancho del Cielo, California     A biographer has written that if you want to understand Ronald Reagan you need to visit Rancho del Cielo (“ranch in the sky”). Reagan bought the 688-acre property—located seven miles up a steep canyon road from the Pacific Ocean and nestled in the Santa Ynez Mountains—when he left the governor’s office in 1974. With the help of just two ranch hands, he remodeled the modest 1,500-square-foot adobe house. Despite objections from aides, he returned there often during his presidency. He learned horseback riding in the U.S. Cavalry Reserve, rode in his western movies, and loved horses, joyfully quoting Xenophon’s Art of Horsemanship: “There is nothing quite so good for the inside of a man as the outside of a horse.” Reagan called his ranch his “open cathedral,” quipping, “If it isn’t heaven . . . it probably has the same ZIP code.”   "
93086,"Born New York City  The multi-talented Clare Booth Luce first attracted attention as the witty editor at Vanity Fair who both reveled in the latest cultural fashions and was among the first to poke holes in them. Married to magazine mogul Henry Luce in 1935, she never had an official position in her husband’s enterprises, but she nevertheless influenced them, most memorably when she persuaded him to launch the spectacularly successful Life magazine. She also distinguished herself as a playwright, and her acerbic comedy, The Women, was one of the great Broadway hits of the late 1930s. She proved her mettle in politics as well. As a congresswoman from Connecticut in the 1940s, she was famous for her sharp criticism of Franklin Roosevelt’s administration. In 1953, the same year that a popular poll ranked her among the most admired women in the world, she was appointed ambassador to Italy."
93088,"For artist Elizabeth Catlett, the evidence against convicted (and eventually executed) spy Ethel Rosenberg during her controversial trial seemed far weaker than the case against her husband, Julius. Catlett made this drawing of Rosenberg for a protest poster published by the Taller de Gráfica Popular, a Mexican printmaking collective dedicated to social causes. The role of women as mothers, leaders, and survivors has been a potent theme for Catlett throughout her career, and her forceful portrait of Rosenberg was intended to be a confrontational feminist statement. Copying the likeness from a newspaper photograph, Catlett straightened the head, turned it slightly for a more frontal pose, and singled out the face alone. By transforming the news photo into an iconic image, she universalizes Rosenberg's sacrifices. Art, Catlett once said, ""can provoke thought and prepare us for change."""
93122,"When Muhammad Ali proclaimed ""I am the greatest,"" it was hard not to agree. Just twenty-two years old when he stunned the boxing world by upsetting heavyweight champion Sonny Liston in 1964, Ali (born Cassius Clay) would become the first three-time winner of the heavyweight crown. A consummate showman whose braggadocio and rhyming banter captivated the public, the fleet-footed and graceful Ali was mesmerizing as he confounded opponents with his unorthodox boxing style. Ali was also a potent force beyond the ring. In 1967 he became a symbol of conscience to many when he was convicted of draft evasion and stripped of his title after refusing military induction on the basis of his religious beliefs. The Supreme Court later overturned the conviction, and Ali battled back in the ring to regain the heavyweight title in 1974."
93125,"In the first months after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, and American entry into World War II, the Japanese push to dominate the Asian Pacific seemed unstoppable. As commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Chester Nimitz was charged with halting that drive, and halt it he did. Under his orchestration, American naval forces turned back the Japanese at the Battle of the Coral Sea in May 1942, and at the Battle of Midway that June, they dealt a blow from which Japan's navy never recovered. By war's end, Nimitz was one of the most respected leaders of the Allied cause.  It is thought that the backdrop in Nimitz's portrait is the wreckage left by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor. The picture thus marked the moment when Nimitz took command of the effort to come back from that devastating disaster.  "
93128,"In this portrait of Willem de Kooning, whose career as an Abstract Expressionist painter was just taking off in the early 1950s, the seated pose is open and informal and Willem’s facial features are essentially missing. However, the outlines of the head and body define individual likeness through sharp, jagged strokes of paint and contrasts of dark and light within a field of warm color.  Elaine drew and painted her husband often during the early to mid-1950s. This painting makes clear her interest in individual bodies and their recognizability. As she wrote in 1959, ""I love the particular gesture of a particular expression or stance. I’m enthralled by the gesture of the silhouette (for portraits or anything else), the instantaneous illumination that enables you to recognize your father or a friend three blocks away.""     Este retrato sentado de Willem de Kooning es de principios de los años cincuenta, cuando su carrera como pintor expresionista abstracto apenas estaba despegando. La pose es franca e informal, y las facciones son básicamente inexistentes. No obstante, la individualidad del sujeto queda definida en el trazado de la cabeza y el cuerpo con pinceladas firmes, de bordes accidentados, y contrastes de luz y sombra en un campo de colores cálidos.  Elaine dibujó y pintó a su esposo con frecuencia durante 1950–55. Esta pintura evidencia su interés en individualizar los cuerpos y hacerlos reconocibles. Tal como escribe en 1959, “Me gusta el gesto particular de una expresión o una postura. Me fascina el gesto de la silueta (en retratos o cualquier otra cosa), ese esclarecimiento instantáneo que te permite reconocer a tu padre o a un amigo a tres cuadras de distancia”. "
93195,"Born New Orleans, Louisiana  One of the most influential artists in jazz history, Louis Armstrong learned to play the cornet as an impoverished New Orleans youth. By the early 1920s, he was working in riverboat dance bands when King Oliver hired him to play with his Creole Jazz Band in Chicago. Armstrong then struck out on his own, playing with all the leading bands of the era and making the recordings that established him as the first great jazz soloist. He had a formative influence on jazz, both as a solo instrumentalist and as a vocalist, where he was as skilled at scat singing as he was at melody. His larger-than-life personality—instantly recognizable not only on stage but in movies, radio, television, and through cultural diplomacy—made Armstrong a major international figure in the promotion of American popular music."
93199,"Born San Antonio, Texas  In 1928, after beginning her career as a chorus girl, Joan Crawford rocketed to fame in Our Dancing Daughters, performing the Charleston on a tabletop. Born Lucille LeSueur, she became one of Hollywood’s greatest stars, initially as a ""glamour girl"" but later in more serious roles. An MGM colleague once said, ""Joan Crawford became a star because Joan Crawford decided to become a star."" Her movies include Grand Hotel, Letty Lynton, Dancing Lady, and The Women; her high point came in 1945, when she received a Best Actress Academy Award for her hard-boiled performance as Mildred Pierce. In 1962, she won new audiences playing the invalid victim of a vengeful sister (Bette Davis) in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? The American Film Institute has voted Joan Crawford one of the top ten female stars in American movie history. "
93200,"During World War II, the USO served as the troops’ home away from home. On April 30, 1942, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt invited “the Hollywood Victory Caravan” to the White House before it launched a film industry effort to raise money for Army-Navy relief funds. Fifty major Hollywood stars would eventually appear on the tour, including Bing Crosby, Cary Grant, Olivia de Havilland, Groucho Marx, and Spencer Tracy.   Bob Hope was the caravan’s emcee, and James Cagney, who had rallied America’s patriotic spirit singing and dancing in Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942), was one of the stars who spent several weeks entertaining the troops. Shown here performing in a USO show with Hope, Cagney created a salute to “The American Cavalcade of Dance” that showcased American dance from its earliest days to Fred Astaire, culminating with Yankee Doodle Dandy.   Ultimately, the Hollywood Victory Caravan raised a billion dollars for Army and Navy relief agencies."
93201,"The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved . . . the ones who . . . burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles. Like his character Sal Paradise in On the Road, Jack Kerouac was restless to discover himself in postwar America. His stream-of-consciousness writing style flowed like jazz, encompassing but not always embracing the Beat generation of the 1950s. Hitchhiking with friend Neil Cassady gave birth to On the Road (1957), which became an instant success. The manuExhibition script, like the roads he traveled, embodied Kerouac's marathon urge to create, having been typed on a continuous roll of taped-together paper measuring 120 feet in length. Troubled by fame, critics, and his inability to break free of beatnik stereotypes, Kerouac sought solace in alcohol, which led to his early death.   "
93202,"A Bedonkohe Apache war leader, Geronimo earned a reputation as a fierce adversary to Mexican and U.S. authorities alike. After his mother, wife, and three children were killed by Mexican soldiers in 1851, he intensified his opposition to those who were trying to subjugate his tribe. Geronimo did not want to be removed to a reservation, and he fought increasingly to protect his traditional way of life in the Southwest. During this period his daring raids and improbable escapes made him a larger-than-life figure in the American imagination. After more than thirty years of intermittent hostilities, Geronimo decided reluctantly in 1886 to surrender to General Nelson Miles. He and others were subsequently imprisoned in Florida, Alabama, and finally Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Geronimo became a national celebrity late in life, appearing to great fanfare at the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904 and at President Theodore Roosevelt's inaugural parade the following year. "
93214,"As the calligraphic inscription around this photograph of the composer Arnold Schoenberg indicates, Man Ray created this portrait in Paris in 1927. At the time, Schoenberg taught at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin, a prestigious position that gave him the time to travel, lecture, and conduct. He also continued during this period to experiment with the radically modern atonal music that made him a leader in modernist composition. Although praised by many within the avant-garde, his decision to break from Western music's traditional tonal scale and his creation of his own twelve-tone scale often bewildered audiences. In 1933, with the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, Schoenberg fled Germany, settling eventually in Los Angeles, where he secured a teaching position at UCLA. He remained in Southern California for the rest of his life."
93216,"Medgar Evers (right) played a critical role in organizing and sustaining the Jackson Movement-a multifaceted campaign to end segregation in Mississippi's most populous city. In the spring of 1963, Evers launched a boycott of stores in Jackson's main shopping district after the city's mayor rejected a NAACP-sponsored resolution calling for fair hiring practices in municipal jobs, desegregation of public facilities and accommodations, an end to discriminatory business practices, and the establishment of a biracial committee to combat injustice and promote reform. When NAACP national secretary Roy Wilkins joined Evers in picketing the F. W. Woolworth store in downtown Jackson, both men were swiftly arrested by local police brandishing electric cattle prods. This press photograph documenting the arrest appeared in the New York Times on June 2, 1963-just ten days before Evers's assassination by white supremacist Byron de la Beckwith.  "
93217,"Winema earned her adult name-which means ""strong-hearted woman""-for an act of bravery at age fourteen. In addition to displaying great courage, she also defied expectations throughout her life. Refusing to marry a Modoc man chosen for her, Winema instead wed a Kentucky miner who had come west with the gold rush. In this relationship, her command of English greatly improved, and when tensions between the Modoc and U.S. authorities escalated during the early 1870s, she stepped forward to serve as an interpreter and later a mediator between the two sides. Although warfare ultimately broke out, she earned widespread recognition for saving the life of a government official who came west to negotiate a peace settlement. Following the conclusion of the Modoc War, Winema traveled to Washington, D.C., where she met President Ulysses S. Grant and attended a parade held in her honor."
93219,"Self-taught curator and reptile specialist Raymond Ditmars parlayed a personal fascination with snakes and a flair for showmanship into a nationally recognized career as America's ""zoo man."" Captivated by nature at an early age, Ditmars was only seventeen when he joined the entomology department at New York's American Museum of Natural History. Six years later, he took charge of reptiles at the newly established Bronx Zoo, where his own extensive collection became the nucleus of the zoo's reptile holdings. Through his popular books and pioneering nature films, Ditmars awakened public interest in snakes and other reptiles. He was also instrumental in creating an institute for the production of antivenins for the treatment of snakebites.  In Steichen's portrait study for Vanity Fair, Ditmars appears in the dual roles of scholar and snake charmer, with an open book and pet python at hand."
93221,"Katharine Graham's mother, Agnes Ernst Meyer, was the daughter of immigrant German Lutheran parents. Attending Barnard College on a scholarship, she was one of the first female reporters to be hired by the New York Sun, in 1907. While looking for a story one day, she discovered a new gallery at 291 Fifth Avenue that was dedicated to presenting photographs as art. It was a life-changing moment, and Agnes soon immersed herself in the avant-garde group of Photo-Secessionists working there, led by Alfred Stieglitz and Edward Steichen. Henceforth, she led an ""artistic"" life in which she was, as she admitted, ""in love chiefly with myself."" This characteristic never faltered: ""Not to put too fine a point on it,"" Katharine Graham wrote in her memoir, but her mother's life was always defined by ""her self-absorption."" "
93266,"In this self-portrait taken at Mathew Brady’s Washington studio, Alexander Gardner presents himself wearing the garb of a mountain man or trapper, sporting buckskins and a fur hat; Gardner’s trademark full, ungroomed beard only adds to the frontiersman image. Gardner holds a bow and arrow while standing on Indian rugs. The image captures America’s enduring fascination with the West and adopting the garb of Native peoples. It also shows Gardner, a man about whom we know little, in disguise, hiding himself in a fictional frontier persona. Although he is acting a role, Gardner, whose family had bought land in Iowa in the antebellum period, was genuinely interested in the western lands and the fate of the Indians. In the 1860s he began his project of photographing the western tribal delegations when they came to Washington. After the Civil War he went west to photograph Indians on their native grounds."
93268,"In place of the wild and woolly frontiersman as Gardner pictured himself in his first, c. 1861, self-portrait, this image shows him nattily attired and posed with the props of Victorian furnishings as the epitome of respectability. Leaning against the chair, with a hand on his hip and legs crossed at the ankle, Gardner is casually masterful. By 1864 he was at the height of his Civil War career, a career founded on his Antietam photographs and solidified by the opening of his Washington studio, the popularity of the Gettysburg images, and a reputation as the president’s favorite photographer.  For reasons that remain mysterious, Gardner retired from photography in 1872 and went into the insurance business; he died a decade later, leaving no records except his photographs themselves."
93269,"Little is known about the life of Alexander Gardner, and even less is known about his younger brother, James, including the date of his death. Like Alexander, James was born in Scotland and immigrated to the United States with the rest of the clan in 1850. They settled initially in Iowa but then moved east to New York City. Both brothers worked for Mathew Brady. James left with Alexander when he split away to found his own firm in 1863."
93272,"Abolitionist and former slave Sojourner Truth was overjoyed when President Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. Eager to assist the many refugees from slavery who had flocked to the nation’s capital, Truth traveled there from her home in Michigan in the autumn of 1864. After meeting with Lincoln, she remained in Washington, where she initially helped to raise funds for the Colored Soldiers’ Aid Society. In December, Truth accepted an appointment from the National Freedmen’s Relief Association to serve as ""counselor to the freed people"" at Freedmen’s Village—the camp established by the federal government at Arlington Heights, Virginia. Working there for more than a year, she was warmly praised by the camp’s superintendent for ""the great service rendered to the Freedmen and their families."" Truth provided similar support to the newly established Freedmen’s Bureau, laboring tirelessly to collect much-needed provisions for patients in its Freedmen’s Hospital."
93273,"In March 1863, a man known only as Gordon escaped from slavery on a Louisiana plantation and after a harrowing journey found safety among Union soldiers encamped at Baton Rouge. Before enlisting in a black regiment, he was examined by military doctors, who discovered horrific scarring on his back—the result of a vicious whipping by his former overseer. This photograph documenting Gordon’s condition created a sensation when it reached the public, and quickly became one of the most powerful proofs of slavery’s brutality. As one journalist declared, ""This Card Photograph should be multiplied by 100,000 and scattered over the States. It tells the story in a way that even Mrs. [Harriet Beecher] Stowe can not approach, because it tells the story to the eye."" Sergeant Gordon was later reported to have fought bravely in the Union assault on Port Hudson, but nothing further is known about his life."
93284,"This self-portrait of Frank Jay Haynes shows the photographer at Norris Geyser Basin during the first American expedition into Yellowstone National Park during the winter. With ice on his beard, Haynes holds a notebook in front of him and looks into the cold wilderness. Haynes was the official photographer for both the Northern Pacific Railroad and Yellowstone National Park. Over the course of forty years, Haynes documented the development of the park and also offered photographic services to visitors. While Haynes captured the drama of the park's natural features by emphasizing its unique geological formations and grand vistas, his photographs also transformed the landscape into a tourist destination. Later, from a specially outfitted railroad car, he sold views of Yellowstone and created portraits of individuals in communities along the Northern Pacific's lines. "
93338,"Boston photographer George M. Baker completed this group portrait in 1869. It shows the writer Samuel Clemens (""Mark Twain"") standing between David Ross Locke (""Petroleum V. Nasby"") on the left and Henry Wheeler Shaw (""Josh Billings""), two humorists who accompanied Clemens on a national lecture tour that year. Having published the satire The Innocents Abroad earlier that summer, the thirty-four-year-old Clemens was beginning to emerge as the preeminent American author of his generation. Until 1869 he had spent most of his life in the West. Growing up alongside the Mississippi River and then settling in Nevada and California during the Civil War, Clemens pursued various professions-river pilot, prospector, and journalist-before adopting his pen name and dedicating himself to a writing career. Although he would settle permanently in the Northeast at the end of this tour, it was in the West that he found his unique literary voice and many of the subjects of his later novels. "
93425,"Taken late in her life, this photograph of a graying Stein stands in what she playfully called the Salon des Refusés gallery at 5, rue Christine. Paintings and books surround her. Hanging on the wall in the background is the neoclassical portrait by Francis Picabia of Stein dressed in a striped roman toga. The six paintings on the side wall and the stacks of them leaning against the table all appear to be by Francis Rose. No one knows for sure how many of Rose’s paintings Stein bought—estimates vary from forty to one hundred—but there can be no doubt that she bought more of his work than that of any other painter after World War I.    "
93455,"Born Canoga, New York    In the American Revolution, Seneca chief Sagoyewatha fought for the British, who gave him the name “Red Jacket” because he wore their red coat. In his dealings with the new American republic, he excelled as a negotiator for his tribe. George Washington presented him with a peace medal, which can be seen in many of his portraits.  Sagoyewatha convinced the Seneca Indians in New York to fight on the American side in the War of 1812. Although in his sixties, he fought bravely at the battles of Fort George and Chippawa, clearing his reputation of earlier charges of cowardice during the Revolutionary War. The heavy Indian casualties on both sides at Chippawa led Sagoyewatha to negotiate with Seneca and Iroquois chiefs, leading to the withdrawal of both tribes from the conflict. "
93461,"When historian Frederick Jackson Turner formulated his ""Frontier Thesis"" to explain American history and character, he began the progress of settlement with the ""Lone Scout,"" a harbinger of the civilization to follow. In this image, Turner likely had Daniel Boone in mind. Boone spent his life pushing westward, always dissatisfied with where he was and always moving on; he ended up in Kentucky, opening that area for white settlement. One reason Boone kept moving was that when the government caught up with him on the trail he had blazed, it usually voided his land claims and expelled him. Although the reality of Boone's career did not embody the romantic legends that others applied to it, the persistence of Boone as a symbol indicates how strongly the idea of the lone frontiersman has shaped American consciousness and history.  "
93746,"Mexican-born artist Marius de Zayas was closely associated with the avant-garde circle of photographers, painters, and writers surrounding Alfred Stieglitz. In this 1912 drawing, he captured the high-spirited, playful side of his companions careening precariously downhill on a hay wagon. De Zayas probably made the watercolor at Seven Springs, a farm near Mount Kisco, New York, owned by patrons Agnes and Eugene Meyer. In addition to the young artist Katharine Rhoades in the driver's seat, Agnes directly behind, and Eugene in the rear, the figures include Stieglitz, his wife, some critics, artist John Marin, photographer Paul Haviland, and de Zayas himself (in a cap). Despite the vivid colors and lively tangle of geometric forms, the scene has unsettling aspects, as some of the subjects clutch the wagon in grim terror. De Zayas suggests both the zestful camaraderie and the tensions that the group shared."
93747,"Born New York City     Agnes Ernst Meyer’s remarkable contributions first began as patron of the arts before she moved on to an esteemed career in journalism and social reform. As a close adviser to caricaturist Marius de Zayas and photographer/impresario Alfred Stieglitz, Meyer co-founded the landmark visual arts journal 291, named after Stieglitz’s renowned modernist art gallery. Meyer’s husband, Eugene Meyer, bought the Washington Post in the 1930s, which paved the way for Meyer to write stories about racial segregation in the army and the plight of the laboring class during World War II. Also during this time, Meyer spearheaded efforts to establish a cabinet-level appointee in health and education.   In this charcoal, de Zayas depicts Meyer with his characteristic cubist-based stylized line. While acknowledging Meyer’s great wealth by dressing her in ermine-trimmed hat and enormous matching muff, de Zayas abstracts her beauty to a sharp, appraising profile, thus presenting her as an individual of intellect and spirited energy."
93951,"Nixon announced his selection to replace Spiro Agnew as vice president on October 12, 1973, and Gerald Ford was confirmed in both houses by large majorities on December 6, the same day that the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered Nixon to relinquish seven tapes requested by the Watergate special prosecutor. During the eight months that Ford was vice president, he successfully separated himself from the Watergate proceedings as they dismantled the Nixon presidency. Ford defended the president even though he privately doubted Nixon's innocence. On August 5, 1974, three days before Nixon's resignation, Ford publicly acknowledged that the president could no longer claim he was ""not guilty of an impeachable offense."""
93977,"In 1976, when Ronald Reagan ran for the Republican presidential nomination, many opinion leaders, editorial writers, and editorial cartoonists, such as Australian born Pat Oliphant, viewed him as a cardboard figure with about as much depth as a movie poster. Oliphant's assessment of Reagan's qualifications did not take account of the two terms he served as governor of California, the country's most populous state. Some Americans celebrated Reagan's steadfast anti-Communism and consistent view of the Cold War, dating back to 1948, when he was president of Hollywood's Screen Actors Guild. Others opposed him as a dangerous and extreme right winger, a warmonger who would transform the Cold War into World War III. Historians now debate the significance of the Reagan presidency, but few dismiss the fortieth president as a shallow movie actor."
94473,"Born Roxbury, Massachusetts  Boston lawyer Moorfield Storey joked that some considered this portrait by John Singer Sargent to be ""a fraud on the public, since it represents such an amiable old gentleman instead of a ferocious bruiser."" Storey was indeed passionate in the causes he espoused, particularly the battles against imperialism and racism. Early in his career, Storey clerked for abolitionist and reform-minded senator Charles Sumner, which inspired a lifelong concern for the rights of African Americans.   In 1909 he participated in the National Negro Conference, which led to the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). The following year Storey became its first president, holding the position for nineteen years. His major contribution was arguing NAACP litigation before the Supreme Court, including successful decisions involving the Fifteenth Amendment (voting rights), statutory segregation of residential areas, and protecting criminal trials against mob intimidation. "
94741,"Solomon Andrews was a physician by profession, but it was as the inventor of at least two dozen devices-from a gas lamp to a combination lock-that he built his reputation and his fortune. Andrews's greatest achievement was in the field of balloon aviation, where he developed the world's first self-propelled, steerable airship. Hailed as ""the most extraordinary invention of the age,"" the Aereon made its maiden flight in June 1863, piloted by its intrepid inventor. This early daguerrean likeness of Andrews was taken by Robert Cornelius, who established one of the first portrait studios in America in 1840."
94742,"James Brown invented funk and set the standard for dynamic live performance in American music. Inspired by preachers in the black church, Brown started out singing in gospel quartets. As the ""Godfather of Soul,"" he transmuted gospel into secular music centered in the emotional conduit of the soul singer. As ""the hardest working man in show business,"" Brown turned ballads into virtuosic theatrical turns—falling hard on his knees, busting into splits and half spins, popping the mike to the floor and back, each move ratcheting up the song’s emotional intensity. As ""Soul Brother No. 1,"" Brown acted as a cultural leader, writing hit songs calling for racial pride. With funk, Brown created a stripped-down, rhythmically driven aesthetic that has influenced world music from reggae to Afrobeat. Much of popular music since the 1960s comes through James Brown’s moves and grooves. Hip-hop is unimaginable without him."
95093,"The first chief of the U.S. Forest Service, Gifford Pinchot was a significant voice at the turn of the twentieth century in debates about federal land management policy. Steering between the stances of preservationists who wanted lands set aside and business leaders who wanted unfettered access to extract timber and minerals, Pinchot believed that the guiding hand of government was required to efficiently manage the nation's public lands. President Theodore Roosevelt shared his ideas about conservation, and the two men worked together to empower the newly created Forest Service and to expand the number of national forest reserves. Although Pinchot upset preservationists by supporting the damming of the Tuolumne River in Yosemite's Hetch Hetchy Valley, he was instrumental in implementing policies that greatly reduced the wholesale exploitation of the nation's natural resources. An advocate of planned use and renewal, Pinchot was one of the founders of the modern conservation movement.  "
95235,"Born St. Petersburg, Russia  Natalia Makarova defected in 1970 while the Kirov Ballet was in London. A leading ballerina of her generation, she soon joined the American Ballet Theatre and sought to be “free to dance as I please, free to develop my art, free to work with whom I want to work.”  Noted for her lyrical performances in Giselle, Romeo and Juliet, and Swan Lake (depicted here), Makarova became immersed in the rigors of George Balanchine’s ballets at ABT. She brilliantly understood how his “rapid tempo and style . . . demands a special ability of the body to move at very high speed. The velocity . . . reflects the tendency of our century. . . . I feel in it the accelerated tempo of our life, its nervous and syncopated throbbing.”  In her exploration of dance in America, Makarova discovered this lively art’s prime characteristic: its ability to capture the dynamic rhythms of our contemporary culture. "
95238,"Born Riga, Latvia  When he defected from the U.S.S.R. while the Bolshoi was performing in Toronto in 1974, Mikhail Baryshnikov was considered the greatest dancer produced by Russian ballet. His electrifying presence in America would supercharge a passion for dance that Nureyev had sparked a decade earlier.  He soon appeared at the American Ballet Theatre and created a sensation. Time magazine described how “for 25 semihysterical minutes, Baryshnikov and his partner, Natalia Makarova . . . were dragged back again and again for curtain calls.” Under Baryshnikov’s spell, dance became America’s most vibrant art form.  He danced in a wide variety of styles, exploring the works of George Balanchine, Martha Graham, Jerome Robbins, and Twyla Tharp. He appeared in hit movies (The Turning Point, White Nights), and beginning in 1990 he collaborated with Mark Morris on the White Oak Dance Project. In 2005 he organized the Baryshnikov Arts Center in New York City."
95242,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  When she was twenty-one, Judith Jamison was selected by Agnes de Mille to appear in de Mille’s The Four Marys with the American Ballet Theatre. She joined the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater in 1965 and quickly became a principal dancer. Her height (5’10”) gave her a regal bearing, and her electrifying performance in Cry, which Ailey wrote for her in 1971, propelled her to international stardom.  Jamison danced with Mikhail Baryshnikov in Ailey’s 1976 Pax de Duke, performed to the music of Duke Ellington, and appeared in companies around the world. In 1980 she starred with Gregory Hines in the hit Broadway musical Sophisticated Ladies.  She was artistic director of the Ailey company from 1989 to 2011, once explaining, “I don’t feel as though I’m standing in anyone’s shoes. I’m standing on Alvin’s shoulders.”"
95243,"This 1976 portrait shows thirty-two-year-old dancer Judith Jamison performing her signature role in Cry. The ballet-described as ""a hymn to the sufferings and triumphant endurance of generations of black matriarchs""-made Jamison an international celebrity in the world of dance. It also marked a crowning moment in her partnership with Alvin Ailey, who had first recruited her to his dance company in 1965. About their collaboration, the New York Times dance critic raved, ""rarely have a choreographer and a dancer been in such accord."" Jamison served as the principal dancer in the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater until 1980, when she left to perform with Gregory Hines in the Broadway musical Sophisticated Ladies. In 1989, just prior to Ailey's untimely death, Jamison was appointed the artistic director of his company, a position she holds to this day."
95244,"Peter Martins born1946  Born Copenhagen, Denmark  Suzanne Farrell born 1945  Born Cincinnati, Ohio  Suzanne Farrell joined the New York City Ballet (NYCB) in 1961 and was George Balanchine’s great muse early in her career. He created such roles for her as Dulcinea in Don Quixote and many new works, including Jewels, Vienna Waltzes, Symphony in C, and Chaconne (depicted here).  Peter Martins joined NYCB in 1969 and became an inspired partner for Farrell. One critic wrote that they were “perfect instruments for . . . Balanchine’s choreographic testing of the dance.” Martins once said that dancing with Farrell made him feel “the steps could only be this way. We were literally dancing the music. I felt like a violin.”  Farrell retired after more than 2,000 performances with NYCB and founded the Suzanne Farrell Ballet in 2000. Following Balanchine’s death in 1983, Martins became co-director of NYCB with Jerome Robbins. He has been sole director there since 1990."
95396,"Born Newark, New Jersey    Everything about Shaquille (the name means ""Warrior of Peace"") O'Neal, from his height (seven feet, one inch) and weight (a listed 325 pounds) to his basketball talent and infectious personality, is outsized. Picked first out of Louisiana State University in the 1992 NBA draft by the Orlando Magic, O'Neal has gone on to have one of the greatest careers by a big man in pro basketball history. After four productive years with Orlando (he was Rookie of the Year in 1992-1993), he was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he won three NBA championships in a row; he later won another championship with the Miami Heat in 2004. ""Shaq,"" as he is universally known, was league MVP in 2000, a fifteen-time All-Star, and voted one of the fifty greatest players of the NBA's first fifty years. O'Neal now plays with the Cleveland Cavaliers, after a stint with the Phoenix Suns (2008-9)."
95397,"No one can change the part of me that attempts plays some quarterbacks shouldn't even attempt, remarked Brett Favre on his reputation for taking risks. Such a ""go-for-broke"" attitude has helped propel Favre into the elite ranks of all-time-great NFL quarterbacks. An eight-time Pro Bowler who broke into the league from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1991, the Green Bay Packers quarterback currently ranks third in career passing yards and second in career touchdowns. He is the only NFL player to win the league's MVP award for three consecutive years. Yet like former Green Bay great Bart Starr, it is his toughness that sets him apart.  Despite being relatively slow of foot, Favre has made more consecutive starts at the quarterback position than any player in NFL history."
95398,"Born Havre de Grace, Maryland    Cal Ripken, one of the great baseball players of all time, played his entire career with the Baltimore Orioles-at the beginning and end of his career as a third baseman and for many years in between as a shortstop. Ripken is best known for his incredible ""iron man"" streak of 2,632 straight games (May 30, 1982-September 20, 1998), breaking Lou Gehrig's ""unbreakable"" record. Endurance aside, Ripken was also a hard-hitting infielder who ended his career with 431 home runs and 3,184 hits. He led the Orioles to a World Championship in 1983 and was a nineteen-time All-Star selection and two-time American League MVP. In 2007 he was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame on the first ballot. Ripken, and the professionalism with which he conducted himself in breaking Gehrig's record, is generally considered to have ""saved"" baseball as the sport recovered from the disastrous strike season of 1994."
95399,"Mia Hamm's name is synonymous with women's soccer. Part of the first generation of women encouraged to participate in sports at all levels, Hamm began playing soccer as a child and at fifteen was the youngest woman on the U.S. national team. She later excelled at the University of North Carolina, during which time her Tar Heels squad won four consecutive NCAA soccer championships. Hamm led her teammates on the U.S. squad to three Olympic medals and a 1999 World Cup championship, and in doing so propelled not only women's soccer, but all of women's sports, into the limelight. In 2001 she helped launch the Women's United Soccer Association. Upon her retirement following the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Hamm held the world record for the most goals scored-by anyone, male or female-in international play.  "
95400,"The only child of a seventeen-year-old single mother, Lance Armstrong learned early to pour his abundance of energy and anger into bicycle racing. Shortly after being ranked the premier cyclist in the world in 1996, he was diagnosed with metastasized testicular cancer. One consequence of conventional treatment-probable lung damage-would have ended his competitive career, so he opted for a more drastic, but less damaging protocol. Its success was evident when he won the 1999 Tour de France, the first of a record-setting seven victories. His extraordinary achievement has led some critics to claim that he uses performance-enhancing drugs, a charge that has never been substantiated. The Lance Armstrong Foundation has raised millions for cancer patients, primarily through the sale of the ubiquitous yellow Livestrong bracelets. Armstrong retired from professional cycling after the 2005 Tour de France.  "
95403,"At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Marion Jones became the first female track-and-field athlete to win five medals at a single Olympics. Capturing gold in the 100 and 200 meters, she fulfilled her goal of becoming the world's fastest woman. Jones grew up in Southern California, where she was attracted to other sports and activities besides track, most especially basketball. While in high school, she declined an invitation to join the U.S. 1992 Olympic relay team and opted in 1994 to enroll at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where she helped the women's basketball team win a national championship in her freshman year. Although Jones failed to medal at the 2004 Olympics and has been accused of using performance-enhancing drugs, she has vowed to make a comeback at the 2008 games.  "
95447,"On February 9, 1964, seventy-nine million Americans gathered around their television sets to watch four young men from Liverpool, England, make history. Ed Sullivan, the ""king of Sunday night television,"" booked the Beatles for three appearances after seeing the response of fans during a stay in London, despite criticism from colleagues that the band was practically unknown in the United States. Following the appearance, the phenomenon of Beatlemania swept the country, causing girls to faint and boys to grow longer hair. John, Paul, George, and Ringo secured their place in American hearts and spurred an invasion of British rock and roll that altered the face of popular music in the United States. This publicity photograph was taken during a rehearsal for the broadcast."
95483,"    Born Monroe, Louisiana  After Martin Luther King Jr.’s assassination in April 1968, African American communities exploded in rage, and the civil rights movement began to fracture. Some black activists began to question the incremental strategy of nonviolent resistance and political agitation, favoring rhetoric and programs that promoted African American separatism as well as the use of violence to obtain it.   Huey P. Newton, then a student in Oakland, and Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party in 1966. Initially the Panthers were a community and grassroots organization seeking to break the cycle of poverty, drug abuse, and crime in the Bay Area; they became famous for organizing free breakfasts for schoolchildren. Over time, the Panthers espoused more violence and confrontation in their politics and personal behavior. Newton was charged with several murders, although he was never convicted; he was also tried for embezzlement. He was killed in a West Oakland crack house on August 22, 1989."
95845,"The heroic humanism of Mexican muralist Diego Rivera's powerfully drawn figures affected not only the American mural movement but figural art in general. In this portrait of American lawyer John F. Finerty, the bold outline, profile pose, and low vantage point combine to create a mural-like monumentality. Finerty espoused causes congenial to Rivera's social activism. His clients included labor leader Tom Mooney, anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti, and convicted spies Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, whose last writ of habeas corpus he prepared and argued the night of their execution. Rivera met Finerty in Mexico in 1937, where the lawyer, as part of a commission investigating trials of political dissidents in the Soviet Union, interviewed the exiled Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky. The drawing was probably made at Rivera's home, where Trotsky was living at the time.  "
95874,"U.S. Treasury Department posters often featured prominent faces to promote war bond drives. In 1942, devastated by the death of his wife, Carole Lombard, in a plane crash, film star Clark Gable joined the U.S. Army Air Force. Attached to a heavy bombardment group and assigned to procure footage for recruitment films, Gable flew on numerous bombing missions with such a tolerance for risk that some considered it a death wish. After six months, having earned a Distinguished Flying Cross and other honors, he was sent home along with his crew. Their extensive combat footage resulted in four short films and one major feature, Combat America, which was used for training and shown in clubs and factories during the war. Although Gable was determined to do more than entertain, he understood the value of using his famous face to support the war effort at home.  "
95875,"Born Peekskill, New York    The flamboyantly named T. Coraghessan Boyle is one of America's most interesting contemporary writers. His middle name was a self-invention adopted at age seventeen, and many of his novels and stories are about how Americans shape themselves to face the world (as well as themselves) as they confront an indifferent and often hostile environment. In many ways, his writings descend from Herman Melville's hallucinatory novella The Confidence Man in their attempt to imperfectly represent a reality that is uncertain even to his characters! Especially interested in the predicament of men, Boyle also casts a keen eye on the unexplored byroads of American history; The Road to Wellville, set in late-nineteenth-century Battle Creek, Michigan (the cereal capital of the world), is an affectionate satire of America's fixation on diet and physical hygiene. Boyle teaches at the University of Southern California. "
95876,"Born Breckenridge, Minnesota    One of the foremost painters of his era, Fritz Scholder established his reputation developing ""Indian Pop."" One-quarter Luiseno, a California Mission tribe, Scholder become interested in Indian art in the early 1960s when he participated in a Rockefeller-sponsored project that eventually became the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Scholder's work demythologized Native American life; he remarked, ""I paint the Indian real, not red."" Stylistically, he departed from genre conventions and built on the example of Francis Bacon, Richard Diebenkorn, and Scholder's teacher, Wayne Thiebaud. Scholder celebrated his fiftieth birthday in 1987, the year that Ken Rosenthal made this photograph of the artist in his Scottsdale, Arizona, studio. Rosenthal, a former assistant to portrait photographer Arnold Newman, celebrates Scholder's international reputation, capturing him with one of his paintings and seemingly in the midst of a brief break from working. "
95903,"Created early in his career, Josef Albers's boldly experimental 1916 self-portrait lithograph reflects the young artist's interest in the new trends, particularly expressionism and cubism. Indeed, for Albers, self-portraiture provided critical terrain for artistic experimentation. This print serves more as an exercise in the development of form than a psychological study. Although the intensity of the subject's expression is striking, one can also read in this fragmented self-representation something of the strains of World War I. Living in Germany, Albers surely observed the bandaged faces and mutilated bodies of returning veterans. With this self-portrait, he not only suggests his mastery of recent modern art, but also his focus on the future and his capacity to lead in the development of new artistic idioms."
95937,"It matters little whether I paint a squash, a striped herring, or a man, Ivan Albright claimed. ""The space, the light, the motion, the position have one thing in common-decay."" Albright, only fifty when he made this lithograph, was hardly the monstrous, aged creature depicted here. The face contrasted with the implied luxury and enjoyment of smoking and drinking suggests the theme of ""vanitas"" and the ephemeral nature of life's pleasures. But the prematurely aging flesh addressed more than mortality. Albright saw decomposition as a part of continual growth, a process with its own beauty, strength, and universality. Using multiple viewpoints and perspectives, he also experimented with space and form, inviting his viewer to enter the picture and experience objects from different angles. Thus infusing his pictures with motion and the passage of time, he imparts his vision of the evolving nature of life."
95938,"With its title referring to Robert Arneson's West Coast roots, California Brick expresses a poignant tension. The broken brick reflects the impact of apocalyptic force. While the fissure dividing the brick might refer to the fault lines of Southern California, other interpretations are possible. Playfully irreverent, Arneson understood the freedom that comes from the breakdown of materials and their transformation into something else. But in addition to the liberation that such accidents produce, the work may also address darker concerns. In February 1975, after suddenly hemorrhaging, Arneson was diagnosed with bladder cancer, which would plague him for the remainder of his career. Yet despite his illness, Arneson retained his humor, remarking, ""I like to do portraits if they project an attitude."" Defiant in its posture, this self-portrait, like his accompanying Brick, launches a persistent challenge to the assaults of nature and the force of convention."
95939,"Robert Arneson  1930-1992  Brick    Well known for his ceramic sculptures and his numerous self-portraits, Robert Arneson tests the boundaries of self-representation-and even those of art itself-with this self-portrait that depicts him symbolically, not pictorially. Despite its appearance, the object is not an ordinary building material, but was cast by Arneson himself. Brick's physical association with the artist is thus a key component of its function as a self-portrait. Evidence of his hand is visible in both his name stamped on top and in the signature inscribed on the side. "
95941,"Milton Avery 1885-1965    As the academically educated Milton Avery transformed himself into a modernist painter, he developed a playful graphic style in which linear patterning functioned like the expressive color in his paintings. In 1933, when Avery's sister-in-law brought him scrap zinc and copper printing plates from a commercial engraving shop, the artist applied his drawing style to printmaking. Avery was fascinated by the qualities of line he could achieve in drypoints like this self-portrait. He raked a sharp tool across the plate to draw dark furry lines of hair, while a lighter touch made more delicate shading around the face. At times his tool caught in the metal, creating a saw-toothed effect. Horizontal strokes defined the background so aggressively that their sharp points appear to pierce Avery's skin. He effortlessly brought together this range of graphic approaches to create a masterful self-image.  "
95944,"Self-Portrait with Elena and Cat  Will Barnet  born 1911    The quiet scenes of Will Barnet's domestic life have proved an inspiration throughout his career. Here he poses in front of a painting of his wife, Elena, holding the family cat. Barnet had been working in an abstract style for more than a decade when he returned to figurative art in the early 1960s. Critic Grace Glueck, acknowledging in 1968 that portrait painting was ""not exactly today's most swinging genre,"" admired Barnet's work, noting that his ""big, flat posterish forms evoke his earlier work as a hard-edge abstractionist."" The artist himself admitted that a portrait can become ""an abstraction: the idea of a person in its most intense and essential aspect."" In this drawing, Barnet flattened his torso and profiled head, focusing on ""deeply felt, life-affirming horizontal and vertical forces."" Despite his emotionless expression, Barnet implies his deep connection to his wife through the compositional structure."
95945,"Leonard Baskin  1922-2000    ""My eyes are my best feature,"" Leonard Baskin once commented. ""They're hooded, like a cobra's. I tell people I've been pulling on the lids for years to make them look that way."" Cobra eyes, cast into shadow by his cap, feature prominently in his 1990 ink drawing. But the looming face is not as humorous as his self-description. The startlingly large scale and distortions of nose and cheeks prevent easy identification with the subject. Depicting a face or figure meant more to Baskin than likeness or self-appraisal. The study of humanity, including its cruelty, suffering, and heroic endurance, was his lifelong commitment. The powerful, unsettling effect seen here pervades Baskin's work. A brutal sort of beauty characterized many of his anguished figures. As one critic pointed out in 1968, ""there is more than a touch of the prophet's thunder about Baskin."""
95946,"Jack Beal  born 1931    When Jack Beal won a commission to paint murals for the U.S. Department of Labor in 1974, he built a new studio whose skylights became the background for this lithograph. Beal, one of the few realist artists of his era to paint from life rather than from photographs, thoughtfully reinterpreted what he saw in the mirror. Here, he shaped the fall of the light so that his visor's shadow cuts his face diagonally in half and leaves his eyes intriguingly obscured. Beal showed himself in a long-sleeved plaid shirt whose grid of lines let him model the fabric's surface while compositionally balancing the diagonals of the skylights. As in all his realist art, Beal marshaled every element in the image to communicate his own ideas."
95947,"Robert Beauchamp  1923-1995    A self-portrait, Robert Beauchamp said, should ""look a certain way . . . reveal your emotions or capture what you think your character is."" This sheds some light on this image, one of more than one hundred that made his handsome body grotesque and that art historian April Kingsley acclaimed for providing ""access to a level of psychological reality not often reached in painting."" Such work constituted a reorientation for Beauchamp, who had been known for the previous two decades as a painter of ""wild phantasmagoria."" This transitional piece's exuberant splatters, brushstrokes, and charcoal outlines, however, still evince Beauchamp's career-long quest to ""lose reality, to make life more exciting,"" and what Kingsley called the ""awe-inspiring . . . freedom of his paint handling"" and the ""lightning speed of his line."" Despite such accolades, Beauchamp insisted that the ""search is constant, the struggle never lets up."" This self-portrait describes the tension between that searching and virtuosity. "
95949,"Study for a Self-Portrait  William Beckman  born 1942    ""I am not a traditional portrait painter,"" William Beckman insists. ""I am not interested in likeness. I am more interested in what feels right to me."" The meticulous care evident in his self-portrait may seem startling in light of this pronouncement. But there is no inconsistency. Beckman does not use portraiture to flatter, but instead turns an exacting eye upon himself. The result projects far more than mere physical appearance, with its palpable tension between distance and intimacy. Although the artist bares his chest and allows the waist of his jeans to droop, his intense expression and crossed arms offer no warmth. ""I love being all alone,"" he explains. ""My way of being with someone I like is by painting that person. It gives me company."" In similar form, the artist's likeness renders him present in absentia, enabling Beckman to engage through his withdrawal.   "
95952,"George Bellows  1882-1925    Although more renowned for his paintings of sporting events and urban scenes, George Bellows devoted much of his short career to making lithographic prints. In this 1921 self-portrait, he appears to revel in the medium's rich range of tones from velvety darkness to delicate grays. The sparkling clarity of the atmosphere, the bold black and white contrasts, and the pose, in which he is actually drawing on the stone, all speak to Bellows's love for lithography. This seemingly straightforward depiction of the artist working at his craft is actually quite complex. The complicated grid of horizontal and vertical elements describes a tall cabinet for holding prints and a window through which we see a balcony railing and a city view. The scalloped frame of what we read as a mirror, however, contrasts sharply with that geometric structure while giving the viewer an ambiguous sense of displacement. "
95953,"Thomas Hart Benton  1889-1975    In this lithograph and the painting on which he based it, leading regionalist artist Thomas Hart Benton showed himself as ""Grandaddy [sic] Benton."" For the feisty painter of the American scene who fearlessly traveled back roads to find subjects for his works, it was not easy to admit that he was aging. Yet he delighted in such visual play as likening the wrinkles of his neck to the folds of the jacket that hung over his skinny arms. He vigorously scratched on the lithographic stone to highlight the bulging belly that strained his belt. In a 1973 interview with Mike Wallace, Benton boasted that he still drank and painted. In fact, he said, ""I think I paint better than ever."" In this proud old-age self-portrait with brushes firmly in hand, Benton asserted the truth of that statement."
95959,"Isabel Bishop  1902-1988    Isabel Bishop chose her subject matter from the New York street life that flowed through Union Square, beneath her studio window. Although she moved to the Bronx after her marriage, Bishop continued to travel almost daily to her studio to observe and sketch laborers, shopgirls, children, and unemployed men. But as a young woman in the late 1920s, she found herself a convenient subject, noting that self-portraiture may serve just ""to provide oneself a model, especially handy for a young artist as a means for studying picture problems."" In this etching, her concerns are formal: structure, form, gesture, and the play of light on a tilted, slightly turned face. The detachment, unreadable expression, and elegant geometry of the head all disguise personality. Even her hand, resting too lightly to support her head, seems merely part of a pose she wished to explore. "
95960,"Isabel Bishop  1902-1988    Although Isabel Bishop's art focused on the urban street life of New York, there were two moments-in her youth and old age-when self-portraiture played an important role. As a young woman, Bishop used her mirrored reflection to help her solve pictorial problems. After a long, successful career, she returned to self-portraiture when failing health forced her to give up her beloved Union Square studio. In a series of unsparing self-appraisals, she conveyed the anguish of her physical limitations. Nonetheless, she continued to challenge herself. Turning away from ""mobility"" to the depiction of motion itself, she noted, ""I found I was much less interested in the genre aspect of the picture, in particularity."" In this drawing, one senses the actual rotation of the head. That immediacy, ironically, does not convey the specific individual or precise moment but instead the sense of a timeless, universal truth."
95963,"Louise Bourgeois   born 1911    Louise Bourgeois's etched self-portrait expresses personal identity in terms that transcend the self. Basing her composition on a 1940 drawing, Bourgeois explains: ""The strong figure on the right is the father, and the softer figure on the left is the mother. And there, in between, this creature appears. It is simply a self-portrait."" Although Bourgeois's work often reflects the emotional toll of her childhood-which was characterized by extreme tension between her parents-this familial group generates a sense of well-being: ""[My parents] seem to endorse me, for better or for worse."" While acknowledging the work's autobiographical roots, Bourgeois enhanced its symbolic associations in transforming it into a print, observing: ""You don't know if the little figure is a boy or a girl, but it is a little god, regardless."" Signifying the power of love and acceptance to channel force productively, Bourgeois's self-portrait functions as a metaphor for creation itself."
95967,"Paul Cadmus  1904-1999     Shortly before making his self-portrait, dated April 1965, Paul Cadmus met the young dancer Jon Anderson, who became his partner and the model for a series of nude drawings. But throughout his career, Cadmus also posed for himself. ""I've done a great many just plain self portraits,"" he noted, ""being the most easily available model."" Although the angled hand, dark-toned paper, and subtle touches of color recall his meticulous nudes, his unrelenting gaze conveys a less admiring appraisal, as if comparing his aging face to his companion's youth. Critics had always admired Cadmus's ability to draw and paint the human form, and he persisted in doing highly finished figurative drawings, even when they became unfashionable. For him, a good drawing was ""less an act of exploration than a fully resolved work, which, like a poem or musical composition, was worth consideration only in its final, perfected form."""
95969,"Rather than his usual buoyant self-confidence, Calder communicates vulnerability in this 1957 drawing, which may reflect a crisis in his life that triggered a reexamination of self. At this time, Calder was in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. Although he may not have yet identified his affliction, he was beginning to experience a slight loss of artistic facility, as exhibited here in the unsteady, slightly wavering line. Such a portrait seems to fulfill the artist's need to affirm his identity as he faces an uncertain future."
95970,"Vincent Canadè  1879-1961  Double Self-Portrait    Those who saw Vincent Canadè's paintings in New York galleries in the 1920s and 1930s were intrigued by this conflicted, self-taught artist who depicted himself with such intensity. He showed groups of self-portraits or included multiple views of himself in a single image, as in this print. The Italian-born Canadè freely distorted perspective and anatomy as he compulsively depicted and reiterated his staring eyes, hooked nose, and clinched lips. This print is based upon a 1923 painting. Critic Guy Eglinton said that Canadè's self-portraits ""reveal most clearly the increasing turmoil of his mind, for, since the conflict is primarily within himself, it is against himself that his bitterest hatred is directed."" "
95972,"Self-Portrait with Spanish Cap  Federico Castellon  1914-1971    Federico Castellon here depicts himself against a coastal landscape reminiscent of his native southern Spain, which he had revisited in the early 1930s for the first time since immigrating to the United States at age seven. He had studied and exhibited art in Spain and France, but fled Europe in 1936 to avoid conscription in the Spanish Civil War. His self-portrayal here in a Loyalist soldier's hat suggests his anguish over the war and the United States's refusal to intervene in it. The sensuous female figure, fetishistic shoe, and suggestive imagery attest to his influence by the surrealists, with whom he exhibited in Paris in 1935. Upon returning to America, Castellon had his second solo exhibition at the Weyhe Gallery in New York. He started to produce lithographs in 1937, the year of Self-Portrait with Spanish Cap, and began to gain critical and financial success."
95974,"Minerva Chapman  1858-1947     In 1906, the year she created this portrait, Minerva Chapman, who was raised in Chicago and later moved to Paris to pursue her career as an artist, became one of the first women elected to France's Salon of the Société Nationale des Beaux Arts (National Society of Fine Arts).   This sensitive portrait suggests an air of animated reserve. Chapman firmly asserts her identity as a professional artist, rather than a talented amateur, testifying to her work ethic with a furrowed brow, stray hairs above her brow and at the nape of her neck, and slight shadows beneath her eyes. Chapman's seriousness is evident not only in her mastery of modeling and her drawing technique, but also in a series of words-amounting to a mantra-that she recorded in her notebook early in her career: ""Work. Ambition. Perseverance. Determination."" "
95976,"Self-Portrait with Hat  Minna Citron  1896-1991    Minna Citron is best known for the abstract prints and drawings she made beginning in the mid-1940s, but this self-portrait dates to an earlier era, when she realistically portrayed the people she saw around her Manhattan studio in Union Square. Citron often made humorous satires of urban women, including herself. In this lithograph, she pictured herself as a fashionable young woman in a fetching hat and a striped dress rather than as a serious artist at work. The gestural lines describing her features suggest a vivacious personality who charms the people around her. She looks up and away from the viewer, her heavily drawn eyelashes batting as she gazes into the eyes of a taller person. "
95977,"Self-Portrait #4 (Snake)  Francesco Clemente  born 1952    Intensely mystical, Francesco Clemente's self-portrait presents not a literal truth, but instead a symbolic order. As Clemente engages the viewer with his direct gaze, he simultaneously probes, with a fork, a serpent presented in the form of the Ouroboros (the snake biting its own tail). Replete with symbolic significance across many cultures, the form conveys notions of infinity and spiritual rebirth that are consistent with Clemente's own view of challenges of self-portraiture, providing a metaphor for self-representation: ""If the face is a mask-no, a persona-that means the face reminds you of what is constant in your consciousness, but also reminds you of what is not constant.  . . . To meditate on your face means to meditate on this continuous transition we all go through, which we are not aware of, or we dislike being aware of, because it's frightening."" "
95978,"Self-Portrait/Manipulated  Chuck Close  born 1940    Since the late 1960s, Chuck Close's monumental heads, dissolving into separate patches and then coalescing into huge mug shots, have been transforming notions of portraiture, and he has portrayed himself frequently in his career. Self-Portrait/Manipulated is part of a series of handmade paper multiples he started in the early 1980s, in collaboration with master printer Joseph Wilfer. Following Close's color-coded drawing, Wilfer squeezed liquefied rag pulp in twenty-two different shades of black, gray, and white into the sections of a plastic grid. After the grid was removed, Close heightened the sense of self and softened the rigidity of the grid structure by pushing through the still-wet pulp with his own fingers. He also let the paper dry naturally, creating a rough, three-dimensional texture. The result is a highly animated surface that seems to move before one's eyes."
95983,"Bathrobe  Jim Dine  born 1935    Jim Dine, whose work often depicts objects with which he feels a personal association, adopted the motif of the bathrobe as a self-portrait after seeing one in an advertisement in the New York Times in 1964. For Dine, the image was more than just a found object. As he explained: ""There was nobody in the bathrobe, but when I saw it, it looked like me."" Shortly thereafter, the robe became the basis for an exhibition of paintings at the Sidney Janis Gallery. The robe also served as the motif for the artist's first foray into etching. As though reflecting his pride in his early command of a medium that he would describe as ""drawing with acid,"" the bent elbows of the robe-conveying the invisible gesture of an artist with his hands on his hips-seem to signal youthful satisfaction."
95984,"Self-Portrait on J. D. Paper  Jim Dine  born 1935     For Jim Dine, etching contributed to a new approach to self-representation. As he later observed: ""Making prints was the first place my interest in figurative art raised its head."" Dine's transition to figuration in the 1970s reflected increased personal and professional confidence. He confronts the viewer with an intense gaze. Using a profusion of expressive lines, he captures the thickness of his beard and the hair around his temples, and also conveys the aging of his skin. Professing his interest in ""what life has done to the face,"" Dine has remarked, ""I love people's tracks. . . . I want all that history."" Taking advantage of etching's capacity to register such expressive marks, Dine invests his 1978 self-portrait with yet another layer of autobiographical significance, printing it on paper watermarked with his initials: J.D. "
95986,"Werner Drewes  1899-1985    The vigorous strokes Werner Drewes scratched into a copper plate to make this print reveal a man full of creative energy. In 1965 he had retired after teaching for nineteen years at the School of Fine Arts at Washington University in St. Louis, but his art-making did not slacken. Beginning in 1969, he thoughtfully portrayed his own wrinkled face in intaglio or woodcut about once a year. He may have intended to study the aging process, or perhaps he was merely fascinated by his own rugged features. Despite the undiminished strength of this 1978 image, with its networks of lively drypoint lines, it was the artist's last self-portrait print. Problems with his hands and arms slowed his art in 1979, although Drewes continued working until days before his death."
95990,"The Dream of Reason  Fritz Eichenberg  1901-1990  With Charlotte or Emily Brontë, Edgar Allan Poe, Fëdor Dostoevski, Lau Tzu, Leo Tolstoy, and Desiderius Erasmus    For more than fifty years, Fritz Eichenberg crafted insightful visual interpretations of immortal literary works, including volumes by the authors pictured in this print. Eichenberg's The Dream of Reason is based on Spanish artist Francisco Goya's print The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters. Eichenberg shows how, after steeping himself in the book he is illustrating and performing his customary careful research, he puts aside his glasses and closes his eyes to begin his creative enterprise. Supported by the author's text, Eichenberg lets his imagination take over. The wisdom found in dreams is embodied as an owl. The figures of American, European, and Asian authors appear above Eichenberg, their eyes closed as they lean toward the artist. The translucent Erasmus bridges the gap of centuries to pick up a woodblock engraved with his own image."
95996,"Antonio Frasconi  born 1919    This work reflects Antonio Frasconi's history-making, politically themed woodcuts in his native Montevideo, Uruguay. After his 1945 immigration to the United States, he remained committed both to woodcut and to political causes. In 1948 and 1949 Frasconi used a freely distorted cubist style in a series of paintings and woodcuts representing, he said, the ""people of Spain [suffering under the Franco regime] . . . through the heroic presence of Don Quixote."" The idealistic knight on his steed originally appeared at the left of this print. The agony of the Spanish struggle is reflected in the artist's face, with its distracted, hooded eyes, and his pose, in which he hugs his elbows tightly to his body. Frasconi later cut away the section of the block picturing Don Quixote, thus simplifying a complex and specific image, making it a more flexible representation."
96000,"Gregory Gillespie  1936-2000    Self-portraiture played a critical role in Gregory Gillespie's career, enabling him to carry on an internal dialogue about the hopes, fears, and contradictions that shaped his outlook and his art. Gillespie's expression radiates satisfaction, and the light that filters through this image intensifies the sense of spiritual fulfillment. The challenge of maintaining such harmony is conveyed by the work's very materiality: the heavily worked graphite is inherently fragile, perpetually threatening to disturb the artist's crisp marks. Such tension has metaphorical significance. As the artist explained, ""My job is to turn the chaos and pain into art."""
96006,"When asked several decades later if he knew John Graham very well, Calder answered, ""Well, I thought I did."" After Graham's death in 1961, his friends became disillusioned to learn that much of his life was invented-from his name to his story of his imprisonment with the czar in Russia. In Self-portrait as Fallen Angel, Graham represents himself with horns and flames emanating from his head, thereby expressing his belief in the satanic nature of genius. Allusions to the horns of Moses and the ""inner eye"" of Buddhism further complicate Graham's delusional conception of himself."
96008,"George Grosz  1893-1959    This 1916 self-portrait by George Grosz was drawn at a moment of intense psychic turmoil that affected his art for years to come. The Berlin-born artist had enlisted in the German army in 1914, and this sensitive, anguished portrayal reveals the psychological scares of his wartime experience. Grosz generally channeled his anger into trenchant political satire, depicting the venality and brutality he saw around him. The maimed soldiers, grotesque generals, and bloated officials of his memorable paintings and drawings made him famous. A leading figure of the Berlin Dada movement, Grosz eventually moved to America in 1933 and became a citizen in 1938. Teaching, winning prizes and a Guggenheim fellowship, and securing commissions, Grosz received admiring attention in the United States. His unflinching diatribes against war and corruption marked him as a visionary witness to his era."
96009,"Painter  Philip Guston  1913-1980    Philip Guston started his career in the 1930s as a figurative painter, became a leading abstract expressionist in the 1950s, and returned to figuration in the 1960s, when, as he said, ""the brutality of the world"" made him ""sick and tired of all that Purity!"" that abstract painting implied. Painter, produced in the infirm, final year of Guston's life, seems to illustrate a reference he made in 1978 to his work as a ""battle . . . with dozens of brushes as weapons."" Here, his battle-scarred and bandaged face, with its Cyclopean eye (a common self-depiction of the 1970s), stares out at his right hand. The pose alludes to his cigarette smoking; a benediction; or the artist's meditation on his future ability to produce art. Such self-reflection characterized Guston's career, which author Nicole Krauss called ""an unflinching journey towards the most unflinching expression of self."" "
96015,"Childe Hassam  1859-1935    Childe Hassam's self-portrait, picturing the artist on the boardwalk at the Maidstone Beach Club, combined his twin loves, art-making and the landscape of East Hampton. His high regard for the setting is reflected in an inscription-almost hidden-that meticulously records the place, the date, and even the presence of the flower dusty miller. Despite the work's spontaneous appearance, a related sketch on the verso of the page reveals the artist's concern with composition. Shortly after its completion, this drawing would lead to a related etching. At this late stage in his life, Hassam, who was an illustrator before training as a fine artist in Paris, noted the special significance of works on paper in his career, remarking: ""I began my career in the graphic arts, and I am ending it in the graphic arts."""
96020,"Artist and Model  David Hockney  born 1937    David Hockney's etching grew out of an invitation to participate in a portfolio dedicated to Pablo Picasso, who died in 1973, and reflects his admiration for this father of cubism. Probably basing his rendering of Picasso on a photograph by French photographer Robert Doisneau, Hockney casts himself in an intimate tête à tête with his hero. Although fictional-the two artists were not personally acquainted-the scenario captured an important intersection between them, for Hockney created the print with Aldo Crommelynck, who had long produced prints with Picasso. Hockney's careful observation of Picasso's methods raises the question of just who is the ""artist"" and who is the ""model"" referred to in the work's title. Although Hockney's nudity suggests his role as model, it is the elder artist who serves as a subject and muse for the younger. "
96021,"My Mother Bolton Abbey, Yorkshire, Nov. 82  David Hockney  born 1937    Present with his mother through his intentional inclusion of the tips of his feet (bottom center), David Hockney builds, in this unconventional double-portrait, on the lessons of cubism. Using snapshots taken at Bolton Abbey, where his parents courted, Hockney explores the unfolding of human relationships over time. He invites the viewer to step into his shoes and observe his mother in the wake of the death of her husband (and Hockney's father). One of the most prominent features of the portrait is an empty space that hovers above her head, which invokes the artist himself. ""In a sense, you are a void,"" Hockney has asserted. ""The world begins outside of you, and it's why, in the end, I've come to believe that this space very close to us is mysterious."" "
96022,"Hans Hofmann  1880-1966    While best known for his vibrant, painterly abstractions, portraiture and self-portraiture played a critical role in Hans Hofmann's intellectual and artistic development. This undated self-portrait drawing appears to be related to a series of paintings that Hofmann made of himself in 1942. In those compositions, as here, Hofmann, conceives of his physiognomy as a vocabulary of shapes: triangles, squares, circles, and ovals. Yet it was not simply his own form that concerned the artist, but also the integration of his body with the space that surrounded it, as indicated by the artist's use of energetic diagonal lines in this area of the composition. Hofmann's decision to tilt his head to the left intensifies this interaction between planes. His drawing thus reveals, in the artist's words, likeness in ""a plastic sense, not in a photographic one,"" obtaining an independent reality of its own. "
96024,"Edward Hopper  1882-1967    Edward Hopper's fellow student at the New York School of Art, Rockwell Kent, recalled that the young Hopper produced ""brilliant"" drawings such as this one with impressive speed. Hopper laid down the basic shapes swiftly, then erased and rubbed the charcoal to capture the play of light on top of his glossy dark hair and the midrange shadows on his jacket. He finished the drawing by deftly adding black strokes to strengthen the darkest shadows and sharpen the outlines of his collar, hair, ear, and profile. As Hopper was crafting such student works, he was also laying the foundations for his artistic career. Although he had originally planned to become an illustrator, his success at the New York School of Art convinced Hopper to redirect his ambitions toward becoming a professional painter."
96027,"Alex Katz  born 1927    When Alex Katz turned toward portraiture in the 1960s, he intended to ""make something fresh and post-abstract."" The large scale, bright colors, and odd cropping of his heads revealed his debt to billboard advertising, the movie close-up, and the media-obsessed culture of the era. His smooth, flat faces also signaled a new, distanced look for figuration, devoid of psychological or biographical narrative. Katz sought the same neutrality in his frequent self-portraits. ""I wanted to see if I could paint [a self-portrait] that was not narcissistic, that was not soulful or sentimental, not maudlin."" Katz's graphite drawing is a sketch for a 1987 triple self-portrait in oil, Sweatshirt III, in which  the central grinning face is flanked by two similar, unsmiling images. Although the serious faces are aloof and inscrutable, the enigmatic smile, usually a sign of emotion, is used here as another unrevealing disguise."
96028,"EK/Spectrum III  Ellsworth Kelly  born 1923    Best-known for his bold abstract compositions, often incorporating areas of pure color, Ellsworth Kelly has frequently turned to self-representation over the course of his career as a means of grappling with formal and stylistic concerns. Just as many of Kelly's color compositions carry within them echoes of forms observed in the world, so too does this self-portrait merge abstraction with representation. Part of a series, this self-portrait incorporates a Polaroid of Kelly's face duplicated with a photocopier. Here, color becomes shape, a formal element that both literally and metaphorically represents the artist who is pictured, testifying not only to his appearance, but, even more importantly, to the concerns that have informed his work. "
96030,"Das Ding an Sich/It's Me O Lord  Rockwell Kent 1882-1971    Rockwell Kent once explained, ""It is the ultimate which concerns me, and all physical, all material things are but an expression of it."" He was generally as intense and startling as his self-portrait suggests, seeking ""the ultimate"" in wild places like Greenland, where he composed this lithograph. Kent's illustrations and writings about these wilderness experiences made him incredibly popular in the United States between the world wars. His self-portrait's first title means ""the thing in itself,"" which Immanuel Kant described as the opposite of a phenomenon-an observation with a purely intellectual existence. The second title comes from the African American spiritual lyric, ""it's me, O Lord,/Standin' in the need of prayer."" This, according to art historian Constance Martin, ""suggests a sense of humility rarely if ever evident in Kent's typically egocentric conduct and the grandiloquence of much of his published prose.""   "
96033,"On March 18, 1968, just six days after her fiftieth birthday, Elaine drew this severe and introspective portrait of herself in charcoal. Although she delineated the slight effects of age, her features and hair also approximate her appearance as captured in painted self-portraits from more than twenty years before. Around this time, Elaine purchased a small house on Sandra Drive in Springs, East Hampton, close to her friends Ibram and Ernestine Lassaw and to Willem de Kooning’s home and studio. Although over the years Willem was involved with other women in addition to Joan Ward (the mother of his daughter, Lisa), he and Elaine never divorced.  El 18 de marzo de 1968, apenas seis días después de cumplir cincuenta años, Elaine dibujó a carboncillo este retrato suyo, severo e introspectivo. Aunque delineó los ligeros efectos de la edad, sus facciones y su pelo se acercan a la apariencia de sus autorretratos pintados más de veinte años antes. Para esta época, Elaine compró una casita en Sandra Drive, Springs, East Hampton, cerca de sus amigos Ibram y Ernestine Lassaw y cerca también de la casa y el estudio de Willem de Kooning. Aunque a lo largo de los años Willem se involucró con otras mujeres, además de Joan Ward (madre de su hija Lisa), Elaine y él nunca se divorciaron."
96038,"Pele de Lappe  1916-2007    Pele de Lappe shared with many female artists of her generation the challenge of maintaining an artistic career while raising children and making a living. This 1938 graphite drawing, conveying both her beauty and her self-assurance, asserts an auspicious beginning. The San Francisco-born de Lappe met Diego Rivera and became a sketching companion of his wife, Frida Kahlo. In the early 1930s she studied at the Art Students League in New York, but she returned to San Francisco in 1934, planning to concentrate on working-class and social-realist themes. Her style, however, reflected the influence of the Mexican muralists more than the quick-sketch approach of many of her New York compatriots. Her lithographs of the 1930s had a muralist's sensibility, with simplified compositions, broad planes, low viewpoints, and heroic figural forms. Her statically posed and sharply outlined self-portrait shares a similar monumentality. "
96039,"On Being Female  Pele de Lappe  1916-2007    On Being Female, Pele de Lappe's 1991 lithographic self-portrait, addresses the complexities of being a woman. Marriage, parenthood, relocations, and two divorces had all interfered with de Lappe's career in art. For many years, she was a cartoonist and a newspaper editor. To support her family, she also worked as a layout designer for a business form company, only returning finally to her art in the 1980s. In this print, the white-haired de Lappe, who had had many lovers and admirers, references through the nude in the background the voluptuous beauty she once was. By turning away the face in one portrayal and holding a mask in the other, she implies that the female must hide her true self in order to play expected roles. Both the nudity of the young woman and the jewelry of the older one could be choices designed to appeal, implying sexual availability or simply femininity. "
96040,"Jacob Lawrence  1917-2000     Jacob Lawrence, best known for his dynamic depictions of African American life and history, rarely engaged in portraiture. But when he made a self-portrait like this one, he treated his own face like his other subjects-as a basis for inventing expressive abstract shapes. In this drawing, Lawrence concentrated his appearance into a few essential lines and shapes. A black arc describes the shape of his skull, only thinly covered by hair. His shaggy mustache is a complex of wavy lines flanked by heavier curves evoking folds of aging flesh. Lawrence left most of his face white to set off the abstracted black shapes of his nose, eyes, mouth, and mustache. Lawrence poetically combined observation with geometry to reflect both his appearance and his approach to art."
96043,"Louis Lozowick 1892-1973    The face plays little role in Louis Lozowick's best-known images, which center on colossal constructions: bridges, factories, and skyscrapers. People appear as industrial workers or urban dwellers whose faces are hidden or generalized into anonymity. In this 1930 self-portrait, a grid of shadow plays across the artist, implying that he is gazing up at a building under construction. Lozowick rendered his own face with the same crisp strokes and muscular symmetry he used to depict construction workers and the structures they erected. The artist looms above the viewer like some monumental but mysterious hero. Sunlight streams down on his brow while masklike darkness occludes his eyes. His glasses cast strange, hollow shadows on his cheeks. Is Lozowick watching the construction workers sweating at their arduous tasks, or does he notice only the glorious structure rising?"
96044,"Lynching (Lynch Law)  Louis Lozowick  1892-1973    Louis Lozowick made this image in 1936 to attack the brutal lynchings of African Americans in the American South. Lozowick isolated the victim's face and brought it to the extreme foreground, forcing the viewer to confront the man's humanity. He accusingly put viewers in the place of the unseen lynch mob, facing the man they were murdering. For those who knew that the face was actually the artist's own, the print held an additional grim message. By 1935, American Jews like Lozowick were hearing about Nazi oppression of German Jews, as well as Hitler's stance against blacks. Lozowick's print terrifyingly suggested to American Jews, as to Americans of all faiths and races, that if Nazi fascism came to America, their own heads would be next in the noose."
96053,"Jerome Myers  1867-1940    Jerome Myers was best known for his genre paintings of New York's Lower East Side ghettos and for self-portraits such as this one. In both aspects of his art, he borrowed from the seventeenth-century artist Rembrandt van Rijn. Myers painted several playful self-portraits in which he likened his bulbous nose and gray hair to Rembrandt's, donning black tams and gold chains like those the Dutch artist depicted himself wearing. This drawing exemplifies a more serious vein of Myers's self-portraits that moved away from the literal example of Rembrandt while taking deeper lessons from his work. The light cloth binding Myers's hair evokes the white linen caps in several late Rembrandt self-portraits, but more important connections emerge in Myers's rich charcoal shadows and his thoughtful study of character and mood. "
96054,"Bruce Nauman  born 1941    Over the course of his career, Bruce Nauman has, in a wide variety of media, consistently returned to his own body as a site of experimentation. Nauman's self-reflexive turn finds expression in this self-portrait, which subverts traditional expectations by distancing the artist from the viewer rather than promoting engagement. Nauman's drypoint etching reflects the artist's interest in the front-back reversals inherent in printmaking. Here, it is not only a mirror reversal with which Nauman works, but also a shift of orientation. Positioned horizontally, the artist's profile hovers between a recognizable image and a fluctuating line. Whether sleeping, unconscious, or daydreaming, whether speaking or merely breathing, the artist, through his likeness, resists personal contact, even as he exposes himself. Ultimately, this may be the artist's most provocative gesture: that of deliberate withdrawal, even as he makes himself visible."
96055,"Louise Nevelson  1899-1988    ""When I used a line, it was like a violin,"" sculptor Louise Nevelson claimed about her expressive drawings, which she frequently exhibited along with her three-dimensional work. In this self-portrait, robust features and restless lines convey her vivid, driven personality along with the muscular strength evident in her sculpture. The double red contours of the face hint at both profile and full-face poses, suggestive of a rotating head, Picasso's cubism, and multiple-exposure photography. Although Nevelson was invariably described as beautiful, she distorts her features with an emotional intensity that relates to German expressionism, surrealism, African sculpture, and the murals of Diego Rivera, with whom she briefly apprenticed. But although Nevelson studied with Hans Hofmann and other renowned artists, she claimed no influence. Recognition for her powerful, often wall-sized, abstract sculpture came late in the career of this fiercely independent woman."
96057,"Hayward Oubré  1916-2006    ""I fought racism with my art,"" Hayward Oubré asserted. He was born into a family of color but could have ""passed"" for white. Oubré proudly refused to do so, however. When a student in his printmaking class at Iowa University made a racist remark, Oubré responded with a print of a black man attacking a snake representing the white race. In this self-portrait, made in the same class, Oubré more subtly resisted racism. He stressed the tan tone of his skin by using buff paper and leaving a thin coating of ink on the plate. Oubré exaggerated the size of his eyes, but avoided the gaze of the viewer, suggesting his alienation. Below the eyes are premature sags, evoking the stress under which he and his wife lived in segregated campus housing, not daring to go out at night."
96059,"Philip Pearlstein  born 1924    Philip Pearlstein's 1996 self-portrait came about unexpectedly, when a poster featuring his aquatint Model in a Green Kimono ""suffered,"" as he recounts, ""the accident that gave it its character as a frame."" Playing with the torn paper, Pearlstein layered canvas behind it and rendered his likeness using Crayola crayons that he had recently received at an art teachers' convention. Known primarily for his unconventional depictions of nude models from life, Pearlstein has seldom represented himself in his work, and nowhere else has he done it so directly. In a 1981 interview, Pearlstein observed, ""my work has been getting more and more involved in dealing with the implied space between surfaces."" In this work, that relationship is explored both literally and metaphorically, as work from the past recycles to the present, revealing the artist behind the art."
96061,"Autobiography  Robert Rauschenberg  1925-2008    Created in 1968, four years after Robert Rauschenberg became the first American to win the international painting prize at the Venice Biennale, Autobiography demonstrates through its combination of text, images, size, and medium the extraordinary ambition and innovation of its subject. The artist appears in each of the three panels, at top through an X-ray, in the center as a child in a boat with his parents, and at bottom, in a still photograph of his performance piece Pelican. In addition to photographic imagery, Rauschenberg has layered other signifiers of his identity into the work: the first panel includes an astrological chart (Libra); the middle contains a narrative of his life and career; the third panel combines a chart and a picture of oil tanks-which  document his hometown of Port Arthur, Texas-with a vertically oriented image of the New York skyline, which refers to his later residence in Manhattan."
96064,"Self-Portrait with Star  Larry Rivers  1923-2002    In the 1950s, when Larry Rivers started to draw the figure, most of the avant-garde art world considered representation obsolete. But Rivers, as he later explained, was ""cocky and angry enough to do something no one in the New York art world doubted was disgusting, dead, and absurd."" Studying with Hans Hofmann, Rivers had learned the principles of abstract expressionism but started to incorporate figures into his work in a provocative mix of gestural abstraction, blurred representation, words, and fragmented borrowings from other artists. This 1990 self-portrait was inspired by a photograph shot in the studio through the leaves of foreground plants. Undoubtedly intrigued by the pairing of straightforward representation and enigmatic abstraction, Rivers flattened the space, making the leaves and shadows unreadable. Odd touches of color, including disquieting tones of yellow and excessive redness in the eyes and lips, are unsettling."
96065,"Theodore Roszak  1907-1981    In Theodore Roszak's youthful self-portrait drawing he asserted his identity as both a visual artist and a musician, two careers that he tried to combine for several years. Roszak holds a mandolin, commonly played in the folk music of his native Poland. He displayed his graphic mastery in the layers of precisely controlled shading that he used to describe his dark hair and mustache and to define the planes of his classic features. Roszak's technique was restrained, the careful modeling giving way to elegant outlines around his right eye, his hand, and the briefly indicated mandolin. His style suggests that he found truth in simplicity rather than in detailed description. In later years, Roszak continued his urge to simplify, becoming a sculptor who created spare, geometric modernist objects. "
96067,"Lucas Samaras  born 1936    ""I have found for myself an uncultivated field; that uncultivated field is the self,"" notes Lucas Samaras, who is well known for his diverse and long-standing explorations of self-portrayal. Here, in this relief etching, the artist uses his eyes to form an intense connection with his audience, while his mouth, covered by a thick beard, is rendered invisible. Small dots coalesce to form a likeness but seem, simultaneously, to be on the point of dissolution, promising yet another transformation and reformulation of the self-a self that is not only personal but also communal: ""And so this body is my body and it is also my ancestors' body,"" notes Samaras. ""It takes pictures and it is pictures. It has prettiness, ugliness and temporality and through it I exist in a heightened state among others."""
96080,"Memory  John Sloan  1871-1951  with Robert Henri, Linda Craige Henri,and Dolly Sloan    Memory is an apt title for this serene image of warmly recalled friendship. John Sloan depicted himself smoking a pipe and drawing while his wife, Dolly, sits nearby; in the foreground, Sloan's artistic mentor, Robert Henri, draws while his wife, Linda, reads aloud. Sloan had been a young illustrator when he met Henri in Philadelphia, and recalled that Henri ""set me to painting seriously."" While her three companions stare down in concentration, Dolly looks up to hear Linda's voice and the soft scratching of pencils. Returning her gaze, we can almost hear the sounds of Memory.   The etching recalls the many evenings in 1905 when the four gathered in Henri's New York apartment. By January 1906, when Sloan made this etching, the scene was only a memory. Linda Henri had died in December 1905. "
96082,"Free Fall  Kiki Smith  born 1954    Kiki Smith, a gifted sculptor and printmaker who has long focused on the human form, pictures her own body in Free Fall. Based on a photograph, the image captures the artist's limbs, face, and hair. The textures of these surfaces, enhanced by the use of infrared film, were further accentuated by the artist's use of sandpaper to mark the plate. As curator Wendy Weitman has observed, the movement of the print out of its cardboard enclosure mimics the falling implied by the title. Another metaphor is operative in the form and imagery of this self-portrait: that of birth, the ""unfolding"" of the creative process. "
96084,"Raphael Soyer  1899-1987    Only through art, like this early self-portrait, could the uncertain young Raphael Soyer face the world. When he and his twin brother, Moses, immigrated to the United States from Russia with their family in 1912 the boys were already enthusiastic artists. However, as a teenager Raphael was cripplingly shy, afraid of revealing his Russian accent to his New York neighbors. He admitted that as a young man, ""I had lots of problems, and for a long time I wouldn't talk, I wouldn't go out.""   In this lithograph, the young Soyer warily camouflaged himself, taking on the habits of  his New York contemporaries. As he recalled, ""In those days everybody smoked. It was the fashion for an artist to draw or paint with a cigarette in his mouth."" With works like this one, Soyer began his decades-long process of constructing a self-image. "
96086,"Raphael Soyer  1899-1987    The multiplying wrinkles on the artist's brow and his receding hair in this 1972 image show the passage of half a century since his 1920 self-portrait. Over the years, Soyer's self-portraits became more hollow-eyed and haunted, exaggerating his age. As his art and understanding grew, Soyer's self-portraiture reflected intimate knowledge and subjective perceptions. He told an interviewer in 1973, ""Your work is what you are. You look at the world through yourself. . . . I always paint myself appearing introverted. Painting myself is like talking about myself, but I never make myself entirely like myself. I always appear older-looking, or unshaven, or all alone. It's the result of looking a little bit more deeply."""
96090,"Working simultaneously as a painter and a photographer in the early years of his career, Edward Steichen believed in the complementary nature of these two expressive mediums. When he created this self-portrait, he conveyed the duality of his artistic identity and his ambitions by posing as a painter, with brush and palette in hand, yet capturing his likeness by means of the camera. Noting that he was ""intrigued by the possibility of producing by photography a picture as good as one that might be done in any other way,"" Steichen blurred the boundaries between painting and photography by employing a printing method that allowed him to manipulate the self-portrait through extensive handwork. The final image, which was subsequently reproduced as a photogravure, was praised by a critic who noted that it presented Steichen as ""an artist, genius, and leader."""
96091,"Sam's Art  Saul Steinberg  1914-1999    Throughout nearly sixty years contributing cartoons and more than ninety covers to the New Yorker, Saul Steinberg blurred the boundaries between cartoons and fine art. In Sam's Art, Steinberg portrayed himself as Uncle Sam, one of his favorite Americana motifs. A Romanian-born Jew trained as an architect in Italy, Steinberg came to the United States during World War II and pursued drawing as a ""way of reasoning on paper."" His thought process appears here as a jumble above his head, not yet applied to the blank canvas. Official-looking pictorial forms, including formal (but illegible) script, bald eagles, and Masonic pyramids from the back of the dollar bill raise issues about governmental authority, immigrant identity, and assimilation. As an immigrant, Steinberg was keenly aware of the ""the voyage between perception and understanding"" and believed that displacement was, in fact, ""the tradition of the artist.""   "
96093,"Joseph Stella  1877-1946    Joseph Stella's early ink self-portrait reflects the young artist's commitment to his craft. Depicting himself at his easel with a visor to sharpen his focus, Stella demonstrates a skillful use of cross-hatching and a nuanced handling of modeling from dark to light, reminiscent of Rembrandt. Although Stella had intended to follow his older brother-who had come earlier to the United States-into medicine, he soon enrolled in art school, studying at the Art Students League and at the New York School of Art with William Merritt Chase. The confidence that Stella exudes in his self-portrait may well have resulted from the admiration his teacher and classmates expressed for his draftsmanship. In 1901 Chase praised one of Stella's portrait studies with the assertion, ""Manet couldn't have done it better!"" Stella's fellow students applauded his accomplishment."
96094,"Joseph Stella  1877-1946    In adhering to the demands of the tradition-laden technique of metalpoint in the early twentieth century, as exemplified in this mature self-portrait, Joseph Stella compared himself to a tree, digging its ""roots obstinately, stubbornly"" into the medium, imagery developed here. The strong presence of a tree trunk, with a protruding branch that frames the artist's head, testifies to Stella's interest in the natural world. His self-portraiture demonstrates the confidence of an artist able to merge the modern with the traditional; the mystical with the observed; and the symbolic power of medium, technique, and image. Describing his commitment to capturing inspiration in his images, Stella reflected: ""The greatest effort of the artist is to catch and render permanent (materialize) that blissful moment (inspiration) of his when he sees things out of normal proportion, elevated and spiritualized, appearing new, as seen for the first time."""
96098,"John H. B. Storrs  1885-1956    Chicago-born John Storrs is most celebrated for his sleek, abstract metal sculptures derived from skyscrapers, yet human faces played a major role in his art. Storrs etched this self-portrait in June 1914, while he was studying with French sculptor Auguste Rodin. Storrs's early sketches display a mastery of academic drawing and anatomy. But, spurred by the modernist art he saw by European cubists and futurists, Storrs began looking beyond this old-fashioned style. This 1914 self-portrait is a rigidly frontal image, isolated from the body with a heavy outline under the chin. This suggests that Storrs was studying his own form to explore the underlying structural symmetry. Such sketches lead toward the crisp geometric structure of Storrs's mature sculptures."
96105,"Andy Warhol  1928-1987    Created for a 1966 exhibition at the Leo Castelli Gallery at which the artist announced his (supposed) retirement from painting, Andy Warhol's self-portrait, an offset lithograph based on a photograph by an unknown maker, pictures the artist with his face deeply in shadow. The print's mechanical appearance and manufacture further disguises evidence of Warhol's presence as an artist. The artist has even relegated his signature to the back of the work, rendering it invisible to most viewers. Warhol's choice of a silver background distances him from the viewer. Implicit in the metallic background-which recalls Warhol's famous pronouncement, ""I want to be a machine""-are references to his studio, known as the Factory; the cinema, appropriate given Warhol's experimentation with filmmaking; and religious icons, as Warhol had recently been dubbed ""Saint Andrew"" in the press. "
96110,"June Wayne  born 1918    June Wayne's drawing explores the imagery and techniques of a series of lithographs she began in 1956, inspired by the ecstatic love poetry of seventeenth-century English poet John Donne. Wayne holds the phallic form of a mushroom, a symbol she used as her emblem. She portrays herself nude, like the figures in her Donne series. The artist made this drawing using media normally reserved for lithographic stones or plates. She applied ink washes, and then added small amounts of greasy lithographic tusche and gum arabic. The tusche and gum separated into intricate networks of dots, enveloping Wayne in the same delicately textured, shadowy dreamscape in which she set Donne's lovers to wander. Three years later, Wayne applied her understanding of the lithographic medium to founding Tamarind Studio, which would revitalize lithography in America."
96112,"The Gift  Ruth Weisberg  born 1942    Ruth Weisberg infuses her paintings and prints with autobiographical references, and women's roles and family relationships are consistent themes. Even in a self-portrait like this one, she functions, as one colleague has noted, ""as Everywoman, who plays the role of guide to our memories, dreams, fears and aspirations."" Weisberg's lithograph derived from photographs and videos of a 1975 performance piece, also entitled The Gift, in which she danced on stage in front of a video of toddlers-including her own daughter-at a birthday party. The gift of the title is mutual: her gift of life to her child is returned with the many benefits of parenthood. But as she reaches out to the children, one senses the bittersweet implication that her attempt at generational connection is futile. The mother will never touch the child of the film who frolics behind her in such proximity. "
96114,"John Wilson  born 1922    ""This business of looking at people I latched onto when I was very young,"" John Wilson once noted. Wilson's 1944 self-portrait, drawn in lithographic crayon, reveals the twenty-two-year-old's assured draftsmanship and experience in modeling faces. The Roxbury, Massachusetts-born son of émigrés from the former British Guiana was taught to draw at the local boys' club. In 1939 he enrolled in the school of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, ultimately graduating with highest honors and receiving a prestigious travel grant. He spent 1947 to 1949 in Paris, studying modernism and learning about non-Western art forms. In his portraiture, Wilson probed beyond momentary expressions and personality quirks to hint at an interior essence. Admiring the Buddhas in the Boston Museum that ""are quiet, still, but . . . have a spiritual force, an inner energy,"" he sought to express such universal human qualities in his own work."
96115,"John Wilson  born 1922    Racial consciousness, John Wilson has admitted, was a key element of his art. ""My experience as a black person has given me a special way of looking at the world,"" he stated, ""and a special identity with others who experience injustice."" Wilson was also attracted to the Mexican muralists, whose work, he felt, had a ""kind of dense power."" The boldness and scale of his self-portraits echo their heroic portrayals and themes of universal humanity. After living in Mexico City, Wilson worked in Chicago, New York, and Boston, where he taught for twenty-three-years. His bold, black pastel of 1963 resonates with the empowerment of the civil rights movement and the consciousness of presenting a black face in white America. He brought these same qualities to the monumental heads sculpted later in his career, including his Martin Luther King at the U.S. Capitol building."
96116,"Honorary Degree  Grant Wood  1892-1941    By the time Honorary Degree appeared in 1938, Wood's popular 1930 painting American Gothic, showing a man and woman standing before a house with a Gothic window, had made him a celebrity. In 1936 Wood received the first of several honorary degrees, offering him the excuse to deprecatingly play upon his celebrity. Wood appears here in the unaccustomed pomp of doctoral robes. The short, plump artist, his shoes conspicuous under his robes, keeps his feet firmly on the ground while the towering academics who confer his diploma and hood have their heads nearly in the clouds. Wood slyly points to the source of his acclaim by including a Gothic window in the background that bathes the trio in heavenly light, while the artist's hood assumes the shape of a pointed Gothic arch."
96118,"Still Life with Self-Portrait  Robert Julius Brawley  1937-2006    Robert Brawley's intently focused eyes reflected in a mirror are at the center of this drawing. The work balances eye and hand, thought and craft. Brawley placed the tools of his trade in the foreground: a pencil, sandpaper for sharpening, erasers, and a knife. He wrote that the work ""was drawn from a mirror, but it was also 'composed' or organized around a formal idea."" Brawley positioned every element, from the diagonal knife to the apparently random scratches on the easel, to bring attention to his hand and eyes. He felt that craft and comprehension merged, stating: ""My own understanding of the image is developed and meshed with its creation. . . . I do not understand the image until it has evolved through hands-on work."" "
96144,"Born Richmond, Virginia    Armed with a Ph.D. from Yale University in American studies, Tom Wolfe became a journalist, working for several prominent newspapers and magazines. His articles on such varied topics as stock-car racing, pop culture, and sports figures such as Muhammad Ali soon brought him wide attention-as well as strong criticism-for their writing style, known as ""New Journalism."" Collections of Wolfe's controversial articles from this era include The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby (1965). Subsequent books include The Right Stuff (1979), his study of the early years of the American space program, and From Bauhaus to Our House (1981), his criticism of modern architecture. His satires, such as The Bonfire of the Vanities (1987), continued his social commentary in fictional form. In this portrait, his friend Ray Kinstler depicted him in a white three-piece suit, a style that he first adopted in the 1960s."
96371,"Cleveland patent attorney and banker Myron T. Herrick served as governor of Ohio for two years, and then became chairman of the board of Union Carbide Corporation. Appointed ambassador to France by William Howard Taft in 1912, Herrick served until 1914, remaining at the beginning of World War I as de facto representative for several of the warring nations. For this and the establishment of the American Relief Clearing House to care for widows, orphans, and the disabled, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Legion of Honor. As ambassador to France again from 1921 to 1929, he sought unsuccessfully to reduce the Allied war debt.   When William Orpen was painting this portrait in Paris in 1925, he wrote a friend, ""I am at present painting Myron T. Herrick, U.S.A. Ambassador to La France and am having an Herricktic time.""   "
96372,"Born New Orleans, Louisiana    Ralph Barton's drawing, published in the March 21, 1930, issue of the humor magazine Life, paired the renowned comic Ed Wynn with Richard B. Harrison, an African American actor who ""spoke with a voice like a cello's."" Wynn was appearing in Simple Simon, while Harrison was playing a famous role in The Green Pastures. Captioned ""The Perfect Fool and A Perfect Actor,"" the image contrasted an almost dignified Harrison with the ridiculous Wynn, replete with pinpoint eyes, outsized glasses, multiple chins, and absurd flapping protrusions of hat, hair, collar, and tie. While such drawings exaggerated human anatomy and dress to preposterous extremes, Barton's characterizations were rarely malicious. ""It is not the caricaturist's business to be penetrating,"" he wrote in 1925. ""It is his job to put down the figure a man cuts before his fellows in his attempt to conceal the writhings of his soul."""
96374,"Born Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  Preeminent Broadway playwright George S. Kaufman collaborated with newcomer Moss Hart in 1930 to create Once in a Lifetime. In this wicked satire, three small-time vaudevillians go to Hollywood to make their fortune teaching elocution to tongue-tied screen actors during the early days of talking pictures. Caricaturist Ralph Barton captured Kaufman (back left) and two of this hit’s stars, Jean Dixon and Hugh O’Connell, during the play’s run of 406 performances. For his next show, Kaufman collaborated with George and Ira Gershwin on Of Thee I Sing, which in 1932 became the first musical to win the Pulitzer Prize. Kaufman’s other successes include Animal Crackers, Cocoanuts, The Royal Family, You Can’t Take It with You, and The Man Who Came to Dinner. "
96392,"Known as the ""Queen of the Screen,"" Gloria Swanson was one of Hollywood's first female stars who symbolized the glamour and beauty of southern California. She often played the role of the seductive siren, a part that at times mirrored her own personal life. Married six times, she pursued her career as a silent film actress with great ambition. Swanson arrived in California in 1915 to work with Mack Sennett; however, she made her most lasting contribution with the famed Paramount director Cecil B. DeMille. Ever mindful of her public image, Swanson played an active role in choosing her leading men and approving her publicity. Numerous successful films made her one of the top-paid actresses of the day, although her popularity declined following the introduction of talkies in the late 1920s. This photograph by Karl Struss was created to promote her performance in DeMille's 1919 film Male and Female."
96462,"Souvenir   Jasper Johns  born 1930    A leading contemporary artist, Jasper Johns helped pave the way for pop, minimal, and conceptual art with his focus on the depiction of ""real objects"" and on the intellectual and physical construction of art. As though reflecting back on related works, Johns playfully applied the theme of ""souvenir""-with its connotation of artifacts and memory-to a self-portrait lithograph for his first print retrospective in 1970. Appropriately for this occasion, the beams of a flashlight bounce off of a rear-view mirror to illuminate the artist's likeness at lower left. Its circular format in turn refers to a ""souvenir"" of another sort: tourist plates Johns encountered in Japan. Recognizing the transformative impact of medium and context, Johns has explained: ""I am concerned with a thing's not being what it was, with its becoming something other than what it is."""
97186,"In this 1981 celebratory anniversary poster, Robert Rauschenberg honored Lane Kirkland, president of the AFL-CIO from 1979 to 1995, highlighting his portrait in bright orange. In addition to strengthening the influence of the AFL-CIO, Kirkland made the organization's resources available to sustain Poland's Solidarity Movement, thus contributing to the collapse of that nation's Communist regime. Rauschenberg testifies to the longstanding importance of the AFL-CIO and its diverse membership with his juxtaposition of historic and contemporary photographs. Seals from each of the unions represented by the AFL-CIO form the foundation layer of the poster. Rauschenberg demonstrated his admiration for Kirkland, a close friend since the mid-1960s, by presenting him with this first number of the edition and personalizing it with an inscription."
97265,"As a painter, printmaker, and photographer, Arthur Wesley Dow created landscapes that can hardly be considered radical. However, as an art teacher and writer, Dow played a lead role in influencing the turn to modernist aesthetics at the turn of the twentieth century. He trained as an artist in Europe, although it was his introduction to Japanese art at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts in the 1890s that redirected his thinking about art-making. In his classes at the Pratt Institute and later at Columbia University Teachers' College, Dow developed simple exercises to teach students about the importance of line, color, and tonality within a composition. His 1899 book, Composition, proved highly influential, and many art schools across the country adopted the Dow method. During his lengthy career, Dow worked with many young talents, including Georgia O'Keeffe, Max Weber, and Gertrude Käsebier, the creator of this portrait."
97405,"Born Hartford, Connecticut    Katharine Hepburn sported a stylized personality and headstrong independence that announced a new kind of female presence in Hollywood's heyday. She was an instant screen success, winning the first of her record four Best Actress Oscars in 1933 for Morning Glory and making such popular films as Little Women (1933). But subsequent choices were poorly received by critics and audiences, and by 1938 she was labeled ""box-office poison."" The Philadelphia Story (1940) revived her career, and she never again faltered. She co-starred with Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen (1951), and partnered in nine films with Spencer Tracy, winning an Oscar for Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967). She also won for The Lion in Winter (1967) and On Golden Pond (1981); her receipt of four Best Actress Oscars is a feat that remains unequaled today. This portrait by her friend Everett Raymond Kinstler was said to be her favorite."
97412,"Born Baltimore, Maryland    Independent filmmaker John Waters, dubbed the ""pope of trash,"" draws the subject matter for his outrageous, shocking, and often X-rated films-including Mondo Trasho (1969), Pink Flamingos (1972), and Desperate Living (1977)-from life in his native Baltimore. Their offbeat and earthy grittiness has influenced many other filmmakers. Waters says he purposely stooped low for the sake of ""shock humor,"" which he described as ""making people laugh at things they would never laugh at if it were real."" However, in a surprising turn of events, his 1988 film Hairspray received a PG rating and then became a prize-winning Broadway musical.   This portrait by Waters's neighbor Joseph Sheppard shows the filmmaker seated in front of the Italian poster made for Desperate Living, which depicts two of the movie's stars, Jean Hill (left), and Mink Stole."
97488,"During World War I, posters seemed to promise a fast, efficient medium for communicating with the home front, and painters, cartoonists, and illustrators volunteered their artistic talents as a patriotic gesture. California artist K. M. Bara's You Are Wanted by U.S. Army recruiting poster depicted General John J. Pershing, the renowned commander of the American Expeditionary Force. Because of two famous advertising campaigns-Uncle Sam's ""I Want You for the U.S. Army"" and Lord Kitchener's ""Your Country Needs You"" in England-the pointing or outstretched hand became a frequent motif for poster propaganda during the war. In addition to that exhorting gesture, Bara used bold coloring and a lively composition of crossing diagonals with the upward-charging horse and the twisting figure. For those who missed the reference to a famous equestrian portrait-Napoleon Crossing the Alps by Jacques-Louis David-Pershing's recognizable figure was authoritative all on its own."
97641,"James Monroe was the fifth president of the United States and last of the ""Virginia Dynasty"" that dominated national politics through the 1820s. Monroe served two terms (1816-24), and his administrations were largely holding patterns as the government began to deal with sectional interests, especially the issue of slavery, that would dominate the antebellum period. Despite his southern sympathies, Monroe sidestepped the issue of slavery and territorial expansion by signing the Missouri Compromise (1820), which balanced the number of slave states and free states admitted to the Union. He is best known for the Monroe Doctrine (1823), which defined the U.S. sphere of influence in the Americas and forbade European meddling in the area. The doctrine confirmed the country's coming of age and was the first step toward the United States becoming a world power.  "
97812,"With superbly controlled exaggeration, Al Hirschfeld depicts the versatile singer, dancer, and actor Sammy Davis Jr. as a struggling boxer in Golden Boy, a 1964 musical adaptation of the 1930s play by Clifford Odets. Set against a sharp-edged, geometric cityscape, the figures of Davis and co-star Paula Wayne come to life with a supple grace and elegance. Davis's performance in Golden Boy, which featured one of the first fully integrated casts on Broadway, earned him a Tony Award nomination. The adaptation changed the main character from a Jewish to an African American fighter. ""The swift, keen-edged lines about the Negro condition,"" Howard Taubman wrote of the musical in his review for the New York Times, ""have bite and integrity."" The same characteristics could be applied to Hirschfeld's incisive portrayal."
97813,"When caricaturist Al Hirschfeld depicted Liberace in 1954, the pianist-wearing white tie and tails, and posed at a candelabra-bedecked concert grand-was television's reigning matinee idol: his weekly show was carried by 217 stations (more than I Love Lucy), and his concert tours sold out across the nation. He played popular music, favorite parlor songs, and classics ""without the dull parts."" Flamboyant costumes were added to his ostentatious style of performance. For the country's 1976 Bicentennial, he wore red, white, and blue hot pants and twirled a baton; for his 1984 appearances at Radio City Music Hall, he arrived on stage in a chauffeured Rolls Royce and danced with the Rockettes while draped in a $300,000 rhinestone-studded Norwegian blue fox cape with a sixteen-foot train. Liberace never forgot that ""without the show, there is no business."""
97822,"Painter and sculptor Red Grooms began his career in the late 1950s as a performance artist in New York, creating ""happenings"" in collaboration with such artists as Claes Oldenburg and Jim Dine. Among his early works were room-sized multimedia ""sculpto-pictoramas,"" offering witty pictorial commentaries on American cities, historical heroes, and contemporary life. Although influenced by the abstract expressionist painters, Grooms made his name with a zany, unorthodox take on representation. His paintings, prints, sculptures, and films established a strain of comic mania hard to reconcile with cool pop and minimalist trends. Looking beyond the popular appeal, critics found incisive commentary and innovative aesthetic experimentation."
97835,"What I like best about myself is my demeanor. I'm seldom ruffled, said Arthur Ashe following his five-set triumph in the men's final of the 1968 U.S. Open. Ashe's composure lay at the heart of his success on the tennis court and in the political arena. The first African American to win the U.S. Open men's singles crown and a champion later at Wimbledon, Ashe expressed a concern for fairness and human dignity throughout his life. Whether he was protesting apartheid in South Africa, serving as the chairman of the American Heart Association, or working to defeat AIDS, the disease he contracted through a blood transfusion and which eventually killed him, Ashe spoke out with an eloquence that matched his temperament on the court. This photograph shows him serving during the 1968 U.S. Open final.  "
98035,"Alan Dugan's first book of poetry, Poems (1961), won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1962. He went on to publish nine more volumes of poetry-gritty, blunt, and ironic, and yet honoring human experience. With subjects as varied as drinking in the afternoon, carpentry, and ketchup bottles, Dugan captured quotidian life. In 2001 he stated in an interview, ""You can't say poetry should be about something or shouldn't be about something. Poems are, the poem is, and that is all there is to it."" When Dugan died in Truro, Massachusetts, where he had lived for years, the New York Times called him the ""barbed poet of daily life's profundities."" His portraitist, Ray Elman, knew Dugan in Truro and photographed him there."
98114,"Few figures in twentieth-century popular music have exerted more influence than Ray Charles. By developing a style that blended the rhythm-and-blues tradition with gospel and rock and roll, Charles helped shape the music and style of other performers while creating such timeless hits as ""Georgia on My Mind"" and ""Hit the Road, Jack.""  Morgan Monceaux, an amateur musician with no formal training in art, used an innovative mixture of collage technique and found materials to produce a series of portraits of jazz greats. Here, discarded plastic sunglasses signify Charles's blindness, while strips of wood represent piano keys and a microphone stand. Handwritten words surround the figure like an aura, providing biographical details. Monceaux's portraits mirror the improvisational vitality of jazz and honor those musicians like Charles, whom the artist considers ""the great rule-breakers of our time.""  "
98115,"New York performance artist Laurie Anderson has been in the vanguard of multimedia experimentation for more than thirty years. Renowned for her use of visual and musical technologies to create theatrical effects, she has contributed greatly to a new form of American opera. Just as important, Anderson is also a compelling storyteller, creating works that probe and respond to our increasingly technocratic society. Her breakthrough performance, entitled United States-a seven-hour, four-part multimedia event that premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 1983-reflected her ambitious desire ""to make a big portrait of the country."" Often playing a mechanically enhanced violin amid a set that combines dramatic lighting, film, and photographic imagery, she rarely sings in a conventional manner, choosing instead to use her voice as a unique instrument as much as a traditional vehicle of communication."
98121,"Carolina Herrera's interest in fashion dates back to her childhood, when she began making dresses for her dolls. Even at an early age, she was not afraid to experiment. As a friend recalled, ""if the dress was supposed to button in the front, she would try it on backwards."" Herrera was reared in a socially prominent family and married into wealth. For a number of years, the elegant flair of her wardrobe won her a place on the world's best-dressed list for women. In 1981 Herrera took the advice of friends and launched her own line of ready-to-wear women's clothing. The venture succeeded quickly, and today her designs are distinguished for their clean elegance of line, fine fabrics, and comfort. Herrera's noted clients have included Nancy Reagan, Jacqueline Kennedy, and Caroline Kennedy."
98122,"Born New York City  Gregory Hines began performing as a child with his father and older brother in the tap dance act “Hines, Hines, and Dad.” As he grew up, he became a tireless advocate for tap’s resurgence. In 1988, he successfully petitioned Congress for the creation of Tap Dance Day. On Broadway, Hines earned Tony nominations for Eubie!, Comin’ Uptown, and Sophisticated Ladies, and a Tony Award for Jelly’s Last Jam. Onscreen, his films included The Cotton Club and White Nights, in which he co-starred with Mikhail Baryshnikov.  Enormously influenced by tap’s historic roots and especially by the work of the Nicholas Brothers, Hines was always driven by “the search for the new step.” He viewed spontaneity and improvisation as defining characteristics of tap’s uniqueness: “My argument is,” he once said, “that tap is the American dance.”"
98123,"Born Bunnell, Florida  Bill T. Jones partnered with Arnie Zane on a highly experimental dance company during the 1970s and 1980s—years in which Jones feels modern dance was “democratized” by personal style and improvisation. An emphasis on free-form movement also connected him to pioneering American dancers: like them, he has said, “I trust very much my own body dancing, and what it knows, so I set about allowing it to do what it does best.”  In addition to the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company, Jones has established a dynamic career on Broadway, winning two Tony Awards for choreography, most recently for Fela!   Fascinated by the cultural impact of new media, his works often incorporate digital technology. He uses computer-assisted scores and programs digital interactions between audience and dancers to push the performance envelope: “How much,” he wonders, “can you pull an audience along?”"
98127,"Carte de visite portraits of Confederate generals    During the Civil War, the Union blockade of southern ports effectively halted the flow of most goods, including materials needed by Confederate photographers to continue their operations. Although some photographic supplies were smuggled through, by January 1862 it was reported in North that ""the Photographic Art down South has completely died out in consequence of the war."" Because southern cameramen had virtually ""nothing to work with,"" photographs representing Confederate leaders, such as these portraits of Generals Jubal A. Early, Nathan Bedford Forrest, and Fitzhugh Lee, typically circulated in the form of retouched copy images produced in the North by firms such as E.& H.T. Anthony rather than as original life portraits created in the South."
98151,"New Orleans native Antoine ""Fats"" Domino was already a popular figure in the world of rhythm and blues when his songs such as ""Ain't That a Shame"" and ""Blueberry Hill"" (depicted here on the piano) exploded onto the rock-and-roll scene in the 1950s, attracting an enormous popular following.  Artist Red Grooms, who listened to rock-and-roll in his studio, considers this piece a tribute to Domino. Grooms's interest in three-dimensionality eventually led not only to his construction of huge sculptural pictoramas but also smaller-scale paper sculpture, including innovative printed and glued constructions like this exuberant and witty portrait.  "
98555,"John Winthrop led the effort to found an English colony in the New World where he and other Puritans of the Massachusetts Bay Company could practice their religion free of the oppressive regime of King Charles I. Born to a socially prominent family and trained as a lawyer at Cambridge University, Winthrop was elected the colony's first governor in 1629 and dominated Massachusetts politics for many years thereafter. Although he proclaimed just prior to landing in the New World that his godly community would be a ""city upon a hill"" for other nations to admire, dissenters in the Puritan colony had no more religious freedom than in England. Despite his charm and modesty, Winthrop could be forceful in argument. He distrusted democracy, however, and believed that God intended him to govern according to his best judgment.  "
98560,"While he was interned in Poston, Arizona, Isamu Noguchi wrote Ginger Rogers about the bust she had commissioned from him. She arranged for Noguchi to come to her house in mid-December 1941, to initiate the artwork. In her 1991 memoir, Ginger: My Story, she wrote, “We had all his materials and tools moved up to a specially prepared floor above the tennis court and the pool.” He worked there for a month.  Rogers was preparing for her upcoming film role as Roxie Hart and was wearing “the pageboy bob hairstyle Louise Miehle had designed for me. . . . It was this hairstyle that Noguchi sculpted.”"
98929,"Photojournalist Arthur Rickerby, just twenty-four years old, took this photograph on the deck of the USS Missouri in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945. Admiral Chester Nimitz (1885–1966), who had been commander in chief of the Pacific Ocean Area, was signing the Japanese articles of surrender for the United States. The Japanese delegation had already signed, as had General Douglas MacArthur (standing, left), for the Allies. Standing to the right of MacArthur are Admiral William Halsey and Rear Admiral Forrest Sherman. All four men held crucial leadership roles in the Pacific theater of World War II, but it was MacArthur who delivered the closing remarks on this historic day, marking the end of World War II, noting, “It is my earnest hope . . . that from this solemn occasion a better world shall emerge.”   "
98930,"Cold War antagonism between the Soviet Union and the United States began in the final moments of World War II. For a week in February 1945, the ""Big Three""-the leaders of Great Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States-met in the Crimean city of Yalta to discuss final war aims and the postwar world. The Allies appeared to be in harmony, but cracks were already forming in what President Franklin Roosevelt called the ""Grand Alliance."" Agreement was reached on two of his chief concerns-the formation of the United Nations and support of Soviet troops for the war against Japan. But left unresolved was the nature of a postwar Germany and the extent of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe. These issues, colored by the three countries' radically different ideas of national security, were the roots of Cold War hostility.  "
98941,"Born Arlington,, Virginia     The second son of Robert E. Lee, William Henry Fitzhugh Lee was called “Rooney” to avoid confusion with his cousin Fitzhugh Lee of Clermont in Fairfax County. The cousins were both distinguished cavalry officers in the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by Rooney’s father. Rooney rose to the rank of major general and was regarded highly by his superiors. Captured in mid-1863, he was released early the next year. At the close of the war he was second in command of the cavalry, behind his cousin Fitzhugh, and surrendered with his father at Appomattox.   "
98949,"In the long struggle for civil rights and racial equality in America, few episodes had the impact of the infamous Scottsboro Boys case. When nine black teenagers falsely accused of raping two women on a freight train were tried in Scottsboro, Alabama, in 1931, white juries found eight of the nine guilty, and sentenced them to death. The widely condemned verdicts and the subsequent reversals, retrials, and hearings mobilized protests across the country and around the world.  In this pastel, Aaron Douglas, the leading visual artist of the Harlem Renaissance, portrayed Clarence Norris (left) and Haywood Patterson, whose convictions had been unanimously overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court because of Alabama's exclusion of blacks from the jury rolls. Focusing on the essential humanity and dignity of the subjects, Douglas's moving portrait suggests his profound response to this soul-chilling miscarriage of justice.  "
98959,"Seven Passages to a Flight   Faith Ringgold  born 1930     Faith Ringgold based her 1998 artist's book, Seven Passages to a Flight, and this accompanying quilt on autobiographical memories drawn from her own Harlem childhood. Searching for an expression of the African American female experience, she started working in textiles in the 1970s. Her innovative story quilts drew inspiration from Tibetan ""tankas,"" African piece work, and black American quilting traditions. Long an activist for racial and gender equality, Ringgold used flight here as a metaphor for overcoming the challenges that she encountered as a black woman. ""Anyone can fly,"" she wrote in her award-winning children's book, Tar Beach. ""All you have to do is have somewhere to go that you can't get to any other way."" The imagery of flying, Ringgold has explained, ""is about achieving a seemingly impossible goal with no more guarantee of success than an avowed commitment to do it."""
98962,"The young British artist Cecil Beaton met and sketched interior designer and international hostess Elsie de Wolfe in New York in the fall of 1929. Although he was four decades younger, he befriended her at once, considering her ""the sort of wildly grotesque artificial creature I adore."" Just beginning his career as a photographer, Beaton was already writing and drawing for British Vogue. American tastemakers admired his idiosyncratic watercolor and ink drawings. Photographer Edward Steichen, Beaton bragged, ""adores my sketches and complimented me upon them being slightly sinister."" This image appeared in American Vogue in January 1930, accompanying Beaton's article about the staid social scene after the stock market crash. He thus portrayed de Wolfe-who at age sixty-three had once cartwheeled into a Paris ballroom dressed as an acrobat-as an elegant, sedate fashion maven."
98963,"Martin Luther King Jr. and Andrew Young, March Against Fear, Grenada, Mississippi  On June 7, 1966, King hurried to Memphis, Tennessee, to huddle with fellow civil rights leaders Floyd McKissick (new national director of the Congress of Racial Equality) and Stokely Carmichael (new chairman of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee) after activist James Meredith was wounded by a shotgun blast on the second day of his planned one-man march from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi. Despite increasing rivalries among their respective organizations, King, McKissick, and Carmichael vowed to carry on Meredith’s 220-mile March Against Fear under the co-sponsorship of SCLC, CORE, and SNCC. Intended to serve in part as a black voter registration drive, the march resumed and gathered strength as it moved through the countryside along Highway 51. When the marchers reached Grenada, Mississippi—described by Time magazine as ""a white supremacist stronghold""—they staged an evening rally at the town’s Jefferson Davis memorial, where King and other leaders addressed the crowd."
98965,"Charmian Reading's portrait of ""Mississippi"" John Hurt pictures the celebrated blues guitarist performing in 1966, in conjunction with the March Against Fear, a 220-mile march from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi, to champion civil rights reform. Hurt spent most of his life in a small town not far from the marchers' route, and when he learned of their presence he came out to lend his support. Prior to appearing at the Newport Folk Festival in 1963, an occasion that led to widespread acclaim, Hurt lived in relative obscurity in Mississippi, playing occasionally for local audiences. Although he had recorded a selection of songs back in 1928, he worked principally as a farmer and a laborer, supporting his wife and fourteen children. His ""rediscovery"" in the 1960s led to new opportunities to record and to perform, and prompted a nationwide blues revival."
98966,"  In 2002, acclaimed photographer Irving Penn brought together five of the nation's most celebrated living artists, pictured here from left to right: Ellsworth Kelly (born 1923), Chuck Close (born 1940), Jasper Johns (born 1930), Robert Rauschenberg (born 1925), and Kenneth Noland (born 1924). Coming of age during a period when abstract expressionism was most favored, each moved art-making in a new direction and contributed to the growing international respect for American art. They helped to shape such influential movements as pop, minimalism, and color-field painting, and in so doing not only reinvigorated the field of contemporary art, but also contributed to New York City's rise as one of the world's great art capitals."
98978,"Comedienne Lucille Ball's television antics entertained audiences for more than two decades. From the beginning of her career, Ball constantly received small parts in movies, yet she felt unchallenged and miscast in these roles. Opportunity for change arose in 1950 when CBS offered her the chance to star in a new show based on her radio series, My Favorite Husband. When she insisted that her husband, Cuban musician Desi Arnaz, costar in the series, CBS balked, finally relenting when the couple agreed to produce the pilot. I Love Lucy ran for six years and was one of the most popular shows of all time. ""This is fun, not work,"" Ball said of the show that changed the Monday-night habits of Americans, closing department stores, taking taxis off the street, and gluing families to their television sets.  "
98981,"In listening to stories told by children, author Margaret Wise Brown explained, ""The more I listened the more I learned and admired the accidental art of the descriptions and occasional flashes of words very near to real poetry."" Brown's work at the Bank Street College of Education in New York City-an experimental academy dedicated to early childhood education-inspired her to write her own children's books. Between 1937 and her death in 1952, she authored more than one hundred books, including such classics as Goodnight Moon, The Runaway Bunny, and The Little Island, which won the Caldecott Medal in 1946. In her writings, Brown subscribed to the notion that fantasy-even dark and sometimes frightening fantasy-was an important part of children's inner lives. As Philippe Halsman's 1946 photograph reveals, Brown preferred writing in bed with a quill pen. "
98982,"Born Fairfax, Oklahoma  Maria Tallchief once said, “A ballerina takes steps given to her and makes them her own. As an American, I believe in great individualism. That’s the way I was brought up.”  Born on an Osage reservation, she studied with renowned dancer Bronislava Nijinksa after her family moved to Los Angeles. In the 1940s, Tallchief became one of America’s leading ballerinas, known for her dazzling technique and passion. She performed with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and then with George Balanchine’s New York City Ballet. She was briefly married to Balanchine, and two of his legendary choreographies, The Firebird and The Nutcracker, were created for her: she embodied the sleek athleticism that was his signature.  Tallchief joined the American Ballet Theatre in 1960 and was Rudolf Nureyev’s partner for his 1962 American television debut. She later founded the Chicago City Ballet."
98983,"The daughter of a well-heeled, socially prominent New York family, Emily Post wrote a little book about etiquette in 1922. Titled Etiquette: In Society, in Business, in Politics and at Home, the book was hugely successful and established its author as the leading authority on socially correct behavior. Often quoted as saying ""nothing is less important than which fork you use,"" Post focused on common sense and consideration for others where behavior was concerned. Her recommendations governing protocol proved so valuable that the Washington diplomatic corps adopted them as uniform code. Although Post felt that her book and its subsequent revisions were quite thorough, readers began requesting further advice on various topics, including appropriate decorum when visiting ""a gentleman friend in jail."" Post's success led to a radio show and a syndicated newspaper column that was carried in more than 200 newspapers. "
98984,"Microbiologist Selman Waksman claimed that the best ideas for lab research came from interchange with his students at Rutgers University. There was substance behind that self-effacing comment, for it was the work of several graduate students that spurred Waksman to explore the theory that microorganisms in the soil might be useful for treating human disease. The most notable result of that investigation was the discovery of streptomycin in 1943, the first truly effective cure for tuberculosis, then one of the world's most lethal illnesses. In 1941 Waksman had coined the term ""antibiotic"" to describe a new class of medications, including penicillin, which relied on one microbe to destroy another. His scientific achievements earned him a Nobel Prize in medicine in 1952. Philippe Halsman's photograph pictures Waksman in his Rutgers laboratory.  "
98987,"Anchored by the reclining figure of legendary New York City Ballet choreographer George Balanchine, this photograph presents an ensemble of dancers and choreographers who brought American ballet to the forefront in the mid-twentieth century. Balanchine's influence over these titans of dance was considerable. He nurtured the performing careers of both Ruthanna Boris (center), one of his first American pupils, and Todd Bolender (leaping), the versatile dancer who brought to life many of Balanchine's most challenging ballets. Boris and Bolender also choreographed critically acclaimed productions for Balanchine in the 1950s. Jerome Robbins (seated, left) saw his career flourish under Balanchine's guidance, and it was during his tenure with the City Ballet that he devised some of the company's most original works. Anthony Tudor (top) would prove to be less compatible with Balanchine, and his association with the City Ballet was relatively brief."
98991,"Norman Rockwell is known for his iconic illustrations of American life, especially for The Saturday Evening Post, that captured, in light-hearted fashion, the timeless challenges and pleasures of daily life, from the excitement of growing up to the joy of a family holiday. He once commented, ""Without thinking too much about it . . . I was showing the America I knew and observed to others who might not have noticed."" As Rockwell reached his seventies, even the small-town America he had celebrated experienced the impact of the turbulent 1960s. Noting in 1962 that ""I am angry at unjust prejudices, in other people or myself,"" Rockwell undertook a series of canvases dedicated to the civil rights struggle. During the same period, he also used his art to record the dawn of the space age, remarking, ""Now I am wildly excited about painting contemporary subjects.""  "
98993,"By the time she made her final appearance at the Bobino Theatre, fifty years after her Paris debut, Baker had suffered several heart attacks and strokes but could still summon the energy to perform on stage. The Bobino performance was an autobiographical production in which she traced her career from its humble beginnings. She danced the Charleston and drove a motorcycle across the stage in a white motorcycle outfit and cap. The audience, stunned and amazed by her accomplishments and talent, gave her roaring ovations. In addition to numerous preview appearances and a triumphant gala opening on April 8, 1975, Baker performed three more shows. But she then suffered a cerebral hemorrhage, and on April 12 passed away quietly in the hospital. She was the first American woman to be granted a state funeral in France, and thousands crowded the streets for her funeral procession. "
98995,"The post-World War II Italian posters of American films often translated well-known film stills into dramatic painted advertisements. This poster features the image of Orson Welles playing a powerful publishing tycoon in the movie Citizen Kane. (The Italian title translates to The Fourth Estate.) Star, director, producer, and one of the writers of the screenplay, Welles is closely identified with the cinematic innovations that Citizen Kane introduced. Critics recognized the film's excellence at the time of its release, and it earned an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay in 1941. But newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst felt it was a personal attack and refused to run positive reviews in his papers, which helped to delay Citizen Kane's commercial success. The poster focuses on a photographic still of Welles's Kane campaigning for governor. An added background cityscape and dramatically lit crowd of listeners heighten the appeal."
98996,"Born Newark, New Jersey    ""Poetry is not an expression of the party line,"" Allen Ginsberg noted, ""It's that time of night, lying in bed, thinking what you really think, making the private world public, that's what the poet does."" Ginsberg, like his literary precursor Walt Whitman, was a poet of the self and its relationship to society. Once called the ""laureate of alienation,"" he became a leading rebel of the Beat generation in the 1950s when his poem ""Howl"" led to a well-publicized obscenity trial. In the mid-1960s, he emerged as a prophet of that generation's counterculture; his poetry readings made him a celebrity, and he gave voice to new attitudes toward sexuality, drugs, ecology, spirituality, anarchism, and the Vietnam War. This 1967 broadside of Ginsberg's poem ""Who Be Kind To"" was designed by Wes Wilson, the influential designer of psychedelic rock posters."
98997,"The psychedelic posters designed by Wes Wilson in 1966-67 advertised the programs that rock impresario Bill Graham organized for San Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium. These three images promoted appearances by Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead, comedian Lenny Bruce, and Muddy Waters and his blues band, all renowned figures of the West Coast hippie subculture. The posters suggest the dizzying, multisensory experience of many Fillmore events, which were often charged with high-decibel music, light shows, frenetic movement, and mind-expanding drugs. Wilson recalled selecting his colors from his hallucinatory experiences with LSD. To Graham's frustration, Wilson's odd lettering, combined with ""oozes and ebbs and flows and liquidy movement,"" made his (and subsequent designers') posters almost illegible. But this innovative style successfully evoked the burgeoning counterculture and spawned avid poster-collecting throughout the Bay Area, across the nation, and in Europe. "
98998,"Born Rolling Forks, Mississippi  When the Mississippi-born singer and guitarist known as Muddy Waters (born McKinley Morganfield) moved to Chicago in 1943 with his “bottleneck” guitar style, he was poised to play a major role in bringing southern blues into the popular music mainstream. He had already been discovered and recorded by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress’s folksong archive, but Chicago’s urban clubs offered new opportunities. Waters changed to the electric guitar, formed a band, and began issuing a series of increasingly popular and influential records. Touring in the United States and internationally, he was eventually embraced by new, younger audiences. This poster advertises the Muddy Water Blues Band’s appearance at San Francisco’s famous rock venue, the Fillmore Auditorium, in 1966. Although pertinent information about the event was difficult to decipher, designer Wes Wilson’s swelling letters proved influential, helping to launch a craze for collecting psychedelic posters."
98999,"Nothing galvanized the youthful, drug-infused counterculture of the mid-1960s like rock music. Impresario Bill Graham helped launch such legendary bands as Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, whose joint appearance at San Francisco's Fillmore Auditorium in August 1966 is advertised here. Both bands continued to perform, evolving as their audiences aged. Jefferson Airplane, and its successor Jefferson Starship, with an ever-shifting roster of musicians, performed and recorded through the 1980s. ""Deadheads,"" as fanatic fans of the Grateful Dead were called, fueled the popularity of that band's intermittent tours and recordings until the death of renowned leader Jerry Garcia in 1995.   The psychedelic posters commissioned for Graham's 1960s Fillmore rock concerts so successfully evoked the burgeoning hippie culture that they spawned avid collecting. The neon-hued colors and illegible, swelling letters of Wes Wilson's poster designs were particularly popular and often imitated."
99018,"Malcolm X was a controversial leader and brilliant orator who channeled racial anger into political action during the civil rights movement. Born Malcolm Little, he was among the best students in his class until a series of tragedies broke up his family. He moved to Harlem and worked as a Pullman porter but also hustled as a thief and pimp. Most nights he hung out at the Savoy Ballroom and absorbed cultural pride from jazz musicians. During a ten-year sentence for burglary, he experienced a religious conversion to the Nation of Islam. Thereafter, Malcolm X renounced his criminal life and became the public face of the Black Muslims, preaching racial separatism to large audiences. A stern but charismatic moralist, he addressed white society as an enemy while calling for African Americans to give up alcohol, drugs, and gambling. In this 1961 portrait by Henri Cartier-Bresson, his unwavering stare conveys the sense of moral righteousness he brought to his political leadership."
99109,"John Loengard's photograph of Georgia O'Keeffe pictures the eighty-year-old artist at her home in northern New Mexico. O'Keeffe first traveled to that state in 1929 and moved there permanently in 1949, following the death of her husband, Alfred Stieglitz. Although she achieved early success as a modernist painter living in the East, it was the landscape of the desert Southwest from which she drew her greatest inspiration. O'Keeffe painted familiar subjects such as flowers, adobe buildings, and objects found on walks around her remote home. Yet she did so in a unique way, often transforming common items into colorful abstractions with an emphasis on form and line. Toward the end of her career, O'Keeffe enjoyed widespread acclaim as the grande dame of American art. Life magazine featured this picture on its cover in 1968."
99303,"In 1853 Italian archbishop Gaetano Bedini traveled to the United States at the request of Pope Pius IX to assess the condition of the Catholic Church in North America and to study the possibility of establishing a papal mission in Washington. Bedini's multi-month fact-finding tour coincided with an intense wave of anti-Catholic, anti-immigrant feeling fanned by the newly ascendant American (or Know-Nothing) Party, and in several cities his presence sparked hostile demonstrations. Upon returning to the Vatican, Bedini advocated successfully for creation of the North American College in Rome to prepare Roman Catholic clergy for service in the United States."
99491,"A Couple of Ways of Doing Something, frontispiece and title page    Chuck Close's self-portrait and the accompanying description of his collaboration with New York poet Bob Holman serve as an introduction to A Couple of Ways of Doing Something-an artist's book that pairs photographic portraits of prominent art-world figures by Close with corresponding ""praise poems"" by Holman. Five of these portraits are on display in the case at right. Begun in 1999, this joint project represents a continuation of Close's longtime exploration of the human face. Holman's stylistically eclectic poems further accentuate the individuality of each subject."
99508,"Al Capone-""Scarface""-the most notorious gangster of the 1920s, was a bootlegger in Chicago, a city whose violent ""beer wars"" during prohibition made it the symbol of organized crime in America. Capone's flamboyance-custom-made suits, expensive cigars, bodyguards, and armor-plated Cadillac-along with his dominating personality and violent temper, made him a leader among the city's gangsters and played to the public fascination with crime figures. Capone's men perpetrated the famous St. Valentine's Day Massacre of 1929. He attracted considerable press and the attention of President Herbert Hoover, who instructed federal agents to put him in jail. This photograph was taken by the New York police after Capone was apprehended in connection with a shooting. An arrest for carrying a concealed weapon, followed by a conviction for income tax evasion, brought his criminal career to an end at the age of thirty-two.  "
99544,"Born Wilkes County, Georgia     A dominant figure in Georgia politics until after the Civil War, Robert Toombs began his career as a moderate who favored preservation of the Union. Elected to Congress and then the Senate, Toombs increasingly sided with southern nationalists as the 1850s progressed. In January 1861 he resigned his Senate seat and soon joined fellow secessionists convening in Montgomery, Alabama, to launch the Confederacy. Upon Jefferson Davis’s election as the Confederate president, Toombs agreed to serve as the rebel nation’s secretary of state. Disagreements with Davis soon prompted Toombs to resign this post and he joined the Confederate army, serving as a general until 1863.   "
99595,"Born Providence, Rhode Island    Painter and mixed-media artist Ellen Gallagher melds abstraction with representations of real things-often drawn from magazine and newspaper advertisements-to create works that examine the hybrid nature of contemporary society and issues of racial identity. Trained at Oberlin College and the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Gallagher is also interested in exploring the relationship between symbols and narrative in contemporary painting. While much of her imagery is drawn from the past, her art seeks to use that imagery to generate new meanings. Gallagher has been selected twice for inclusion in the Whitney Museum's prestigious biennial exhibition."
99596,"Born Oceanside, California    The work of New York painter James Siena involves often intricate abstract patterns that are reminiscent of a quilt or latticework. A critic once noted that when he first saw some of Siena's work, he thought that it was not much more than doodling; yet on closer examination, he began to appreciate its meticulous intricacies. Ultimately, he concluded that the craft and intelligence found in Siena's art gave credence to the speculation that ""the only thing as complex as the universe may be the human brain."" Widely exhibited and collected, Siena's work suggests new ideas about the tradition of abstract painting."
99597,"Born Monroe, Washington    In this self-portrait Chuck Close looks directly into the lens of Jerry Spagnoli's daguerreotype camera. Close used a bright flash, a dark background, and a short focal length in order to enhance the immediacy and three-dimensionality of the portrait. Close recently commented about this project, ""it was more warts-and-all than any other process. Because [the medium is] so red-sensitive, any marks, any flaws are heightened. . . . Each one of these people who lent me their image with no control over how it's going to come out, in this act of incredible generosity, had to put away whatever self-image they had of how they looked and accept this other image as being them."""
99598,"Born Glen Ellyn, Illinois     Avant-garde composer and performer Laurie Anderson was trained as a sculptor and evolved into a musician during the 1970s when she put on a series of multimedia art installations and performance pieces. She started releasing records in the late 1970s and became part of the countercultural art scene that included such figures as Frank Zappa, Philip Glass, and John Cage, who all bridged popular and high art in order to create new, post-harmonic musical compositions. Anderson attained mainstream success with a number-one record in England (1981), and in 2003 she was named NASA's artist in residence, composing the piece The End of the Moon. "
99599,"Born Baltimore, Maryland     One of the most influential figures in modern music, Philip Glass is a composer, conductor, and musician. Although characterized as a minimalist, he insists that by training and temperament he is a classicist. He means that he plays against the classical tradition, as his wittily entitled ""Another Look at Harmony"" (1975-77) suggests. His work always shows a restless exploration of forms composed for performance, ranging from solo instruments to operas for large ensembles. Like most of the twentieth century avant-garde, he is fond of multimedia presentations, working with dancer Twyla Tharp and playwright/librettist Robert Wilson. "
99610,"Chuck Close's self-portrait and the accompanying description of his collaboration with New York poet Bob Holman serve as an introduction to A Couple of Ways of Doing Something-an artist's book that pairs photographic portraits of prominent art-world figures by Close with corresponding ""praise poems"" by Holman.

99686,"Son of an Arkansas sharecropper, country music legend Johnny Cash (right)-the ""Man in Black""-sold more than fifty million records and recorded more than 1,500 songs, including such hits as ""Ring of Fire"" and ""I Walk the Line."" In this 1974 photograph by Jim Marshall, Cash stands alongside his friend, collaborator, and one-time roommate Waylon Jennings, who himself enjoyed wide renown as a country music star with such albums as Honky Tonk Heroes. While both men contributed greatly to country music's rise to international importance beginning in the 1950s, it was Cash-the winner of eleven Grammys and the host of his own television show-who became the much-beloved face of this musical tradition. Although he sang ""I shot a man in Reno/Just to watch him die,"" he began his concerts with the friendly greeting, ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.""  "
99692,"For actor-director Orson Welles, the impulse to innovate was second nature. By 1937, his unconventional stagings of such works as Shakespeare's Julius Caesar had established him as live theater's boy wonder. When he turned to radio directing, Welles proved no less inventive, and in the late 1930s he raised radio drama to new levels of sophistication. The most celebrated testament to Welles's genius, however, was Citizen Kane, a movie that he starred in, co-authored, and directed. Based on the life of news mogul William Randolph Hearst, Kane ranks today among the finest films ever made.  Welles is pictured here in a radio studio about the time he produced ""The War of the Worlds"" for Mercury Theatre on the Air. He made that drama about aliens invading Earth so convincing that it sent many of his listeners into a panic.  "
99726,"Marsden Hartley's work as an artist and poet was continually influenced by his friendships with contemporary artists and writers. Beginning in 1909 he exhibited his work in New York at Alfred Stieglitz's 291 gallery. After visiting Paris and Berlin, he became fascinated with ethnographic and folk art and with German abstraction, which led him to paint a series of heavily symbolic militaristic images. His work in the United States after World War I included themes from American Indian art as well as landscapes of the Southwest. Late in life, he returned to Maine, where he created stark, almost primitive, paintings of the landscape and of fishermen.   Arbit Blatas moved from Lithuania to Paris as an adolescent and came to the United States at the outbreak of World War II. After Blatas painted this portrait of his longtime friend, Hartley gave him the blue stone ring that he wears in the portrait. "
99727,"Television host David Letterman has been a staple of late-night comedy for more than two decades. From a middle-class Indianapolis family, Letterman grew up playing baseball, working a paper route, and dreaming of broadcasting. Moving to Los Angeles, he performed stand-up comedy and wrote Exhibition scripts for such sitcoms as Good Times. In 1978 the gap-toothed comedian appeared on The Tonight Show, after which he regularly filled in as guest host for Johnny Carson. Letterman's quirky sense of humor and wacky stunts earned him his own late-night show at NBC and later at CBS. With its offbeat humor and nightly ""Top Ten"" lists, The Late Show with David Letterman reinvented late-night entertainment, giving it a hip, sarcastic edge.   This 1994 caricature by John Kascht was the first color drawing to appear in the Arts and Leisure section of the New York Times.  "
99730,"Hailed by Time magazine as the ""master of the mike,"" Larry King has been informing audiences for the last twenty years on Larry King Live, the first worldwide phone-in television talk show. Having honed his skills as a radio broadcaster, King became renowned for his candid interviews. He features guests ranging across the political, economic, and entertainment spectrum, from world leaders to imprisoned convicts. In his more than forty-five years in broadcasting, King has accumulated tens of thousands of interviews-including every U.S. president since Gerald Ford-and has received numerous awards and honorary degrees. He has also written fourteen books, married seven times, and established a foundation for cardiac care. John Kascht's drawing for an article in Fast Company depicts the insatiably curious King-with his trademark glasses, rolled sleeves, and suspenders-in the act of interviewing a water cooler.  "
99732,"Born New York City    As chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1987 to 2006, Alan Greenspan exerted enormous influence over the American economy while serving four presidents: Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush. Greenspan's attention to the power of interest rates, which he tended to keep low, is reflected in John Kascht's 1999 caricature for Business Week, which casts Greenspan, quite literally, as a financial guru. If not an eastern mystic, Greenspan has indeed thought deeply about the personal and social implications of specific economic policies, and in the 1950s he began a long friendship with the novelist Ayn Rand, embracing her philosophy of Objectivism and contributing to her 1966 volume, Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal. Since his retirement from the Federal Reserve, Greenspan has published his memoirs and entered the private financial sector. "
99733,"With her trademark dreadlocks and confrontational humor, Whoopi Goldberg became one of the first minority women to enter the mainstream comedy field and the second black woman to receive an Academy Award. Born Caryn Elaine Johnson, Goldberg rose from meager beginnings in a Manhattan housing project to fame as an actress, comedian, singer, and activist. She adopted her stage name while working with the San Diego Repertory Theatre and achieved success as a stand-up comedian in a one-woman Broadway show before her debut in the lead role of Stephen Spielberg's film adaptation of Alice Walker's book The Color Purple (1985). Widely acclaimed, Goldberg soon appeared in several movies, including Ghost (1990), for which she won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. John Kascht drew this caricature for the Washington Times in October 2001, when Goldberg received the Kennedy Center's Mark Twain Prize for American Humor."
99734,"Born Omaha, Nebraska    Highly celebrated for his prowess as one of the nation's most successful investors, Warren Buffet, popularly known as the ""Oracle of Omaha,"" is the longtime leader of the highly successful holding company Berkshire Hathaway. John Kascht's 2003 caricature, commissioned but not published by the Wall Street Journal, casts this savvy player of the stock market as a ""poker-faced"" gambler with his cards close to his chest. One of the world's wealthiest men, Buffet has also become a significant philanthropist and major supporter of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, explaining, ""If you're in the luckiest one per cent of humanity, you owe it to the rest of humanity to think about the other ninety-nine per cent."" "
99743,"  Throughout her life, Wilma Rudolph overcame adversity. Born prematurely, she was a sickly child who was not expected to walk, much less run. After wearing a leg brace and undergoing years of therapy, Rudolph gained strength and emerged as a stellar athlete. Invited to train with the Tennessee State track team while she was still in high school, Rudolph became the first American woman to capture three track and field gold medals in a single Olympics with her first-place finishes in the 100-meter and the 200-meter dashes, and the four-by-one-hundred relay, at the 1960 Rome Olympiad. When Rudolph later refused to attend segregated events in her hometown of Clarksville, Tennessee, the parade and banquet held to honor her Olympic victories became that town's first integrated functions. This image by Life photographer George Silk captures Rudolph's finish in the 100-meter dash at the 1960 Olympics.  "
99760,"Born near present-day Billings, Montana     A celebrated warrior as a young man, Plenty Coups played a crucial role in leading the Crow nation during the difficult transition to reservation life. Like his near-contemporary Booker T. Washington, he stressed the importance of education as a means to maintain tribal integrity and urged his people to become self-sufficient farmers. Although Plenty Coups became a Catholic, he revered and sought to carry on the native religion and traditional folkways of the Crow. Dressed in ceremonial regalia, Plenty Coups is thought to have posed for this photograph at the outset of his 1921 trip to Washington, D.C., where he served as the Native American representative at the burial of the unknown soldier of World War I at Arlington National Cemetery. Three years later, in part because of the Native contribution to the war effort, Congress passed the landmark Indian Citizenship Act."
99763,"This photograph shows four members of the Mattachine Society in 1966, including Craig Rodwell-pictured facing the camera with his eyes downcast-demanding to be served at Julius's Bar in Greenwich Village. At the time, many bars refused to sell liquor to gays because New York regulations forbade the practice. This so-called ""sip-in"" by Rodwell and other activists was intended to call attention to this and other forms of discrimination against the gay community. Moving to New York at the age of eighteen, Rodwell emerged as one of the most prominent and aggressive gay rights activists of the period. He moved the Mattachine Society in a more confrontational direction and insisted that the movement be part of the general civil rights and liberation movements of the 1960s. He was a major figure in the ""Stonewall"" riots of 1969 and later founded what became the first Gay Pride parade.  "
99768,"Inserting himself into a final episode of his popular comic strip, Jules Feiffer answered a ballerina's inquiry about what he would do after retiring by responding, to her horror, ""I'll dance!"" In this self-portrait, Feiffer does exactly that, pairing the top hat, tails, and exuberant movement with the anxious persona often incorporated into his work. Along with his Pulitzer Prize-winning comic art, which includes nineteen volumes of collected cartoons, this versatile artist has produced children's books, an Obie Award-winning play, the screenplay for Carnal Knowledge, and an Oscar-winning animated short, Munro. In various forms, Feiffer attempts to show ""the mess that all of us are in"" and humanize it. Although he can be caustic, Feiffer leavens his cynicism with a joyously animated line and that whimsical hilarity that both his adult and juvenile audiences have always found appealing.  "
99773,"Born Breaux Bridge, Louisiana  Branford Marsalis comes from the famous musical family of Louisiana Marsalises, although his reputation has always been somewhat overshadowed by that of his brother Wynton. Nonetheless, he is a talented saxophonist—playing all four kinds of the instrument—in his own right. He has performed with some notable ensembles, including the Jazz Messengers, as well as groups fronted by Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis. As live jazz became a precarious way to make a living, Branford started playing and recording pop and classical music; he also had a long-running gig (1992–95) as the leader of the Tonight Show’s house band. He has taught music at several universities and has been a leader in the movement to revive the New Orleans jazz and cultural scene after Hurricane Katrina."
99775,"Born New Orleans, Louisiana  Jazz in America always seems to be on the verge of disappearing, but it stays alive, thanks to practitioners such as Wynton Marsalis. A musical prodigy, the New Orleans–born Marsalis combines the careers of virtuoso trumpet player, composer, and impresario in a way that emphasizes jazz’s all-embracing creativity. He went to New York’s famed Juilliard School in 1979 and played in clubs around town, joining Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers. Continuing to play, he also promoted the advancement of jazz, founding Lincoln Center’s jazz program in 1987 and appearing on television in both documentary and performance programming. Marsalis is not without his critics, who think that he has made jazz too conservative an art form. However, he has won nine Grammy Awards, as well as a Pulitzer Prize for music (1997). "
99776,"Edward Hopper was twenty-one when he sketched this quietly confident self-portrait. A student at the prestigious New York School of Art, Hopper had recently received awards for drawing and oil painting. The drawing reveals the influence of his teacher, Robert Henri, in its informal pose and strong, loose strokes of charcoal. Hopper's depiction of himself in a jacket and roll-neck sweater demonstrates his wish to be seen as youthful, unpretentious, and modern. Such sweaters were popular for outdoor athletics such as football and cycling.  Although two decades would pass before Hopper attained recognition for his realist painting, this drawing demonstrates a modern sensitivity to medium and self-representation. In 1935 Hopper remarked: ""In every artist's development the germ of the later work is always found in the earlier. . . . What he was once, he always is, with slight modifications."""
99790,"James Duncan Graham was a Virginia-born army officer who had graduated from West Point in 1817 and served on several surveying and scientific expeditions to the American West. He later became one of the founders of the army’s topographical section and was valued for his mapmaking skills.  Welsh-born photographer John Plumbe Jr. helped demonstrate the commercial viability of photography by establishing a network of daguerreian galleries throughout the country, including one in Washington, D.C. (1844). He specialized in portraits of government officials, such as this one of Graham, and landmarks, taking the first image of the U.S. Capitol. Plumbe was fascinated by the American West, which may have been another connection between him and Graham."
99796,"Born Westfield, New Jersey    Perhaps best known for the newborn assessment test that bears her name, Virginia Apgar was a pioneer in anesthesiology and the study of birth defects. She became the first woman to head a medical division at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in 1938 and the first female full professor at Columbia University. Later, at Cornell University Medical College, she was the first American faculty member with a position devoted to the subspecialty of congenital disorders. In 1952 Apgar developed the standardized method for evaluating an infant's health at birth based on appearance, heart rate, reflex irritability, muscle tone, and respiration. Still in worldwide use, the Apgar test enables medical staff to quickly assess a newborn's condition and initiate treatment if necessary. As one physician has noted, ""Every baby born in a modern hospital anywhere in the world is looked at first through the eyes of Virginia Apgar."""
99805,"  John Wesley Jarvis made this outdoor sketch of the young lawyer turned author Washington Irving in 1808. At the time, Irving was attracting attention for the breezy satirical journal Salmagundi, written and edited with his brother and James Kirke Paulding. The following year, Irving's History of New York by ""Diedrich Knickerbocker"" would firmly establish his literary reputation. While Irving distinguished himself as a man of letters, Jarvis launched his own career painting portraits of young New York literati. Although Irving jokingly described the artist as ""one of the queerest, ugliest . . . little creatures in the world,"" he admired his work and hung his oil portrait by Jarvis in his home. This earlier sketch, once owned by Paulding, sets the future author of ""Rip Van Winkle"" and ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" within the Knickerbocker literary circle at the onset of his career."
99806,"At the start of the war, President Lincoln, desperate to find able officers, appointed Benjamin F. Butler a major general of Union volunteers. Butler, however, was a political general and proved to be largely ill-suited for military command. Ultimately, General Ulysses S. Grant requested his removal late in the war, and Lincoln sent Butler back to his home in Massachusetts.  In this portfolio containing twelve sketches, Volck ridicules Butler’s war service, especially his brief tenure as the military governor of New Orleans in 1862. There, Butler was accused of overstepping his authority, to the point of allegedly pilfering silver spoons from the houses he inhabited."
99832,"This print shows Charles III, king of Spain and of Naples and Sicily, surrounded by the treasures of Herculaneum. The ruins of that ancient Roman city were excavated during Charles's reign in Naples and amplified scholarly knowledge about life in antiquity. Yet Charles was not only interested in the wonders of the past, but also in the welfare of his subjects. He modernized Madrid and severely curbed the power of the Inquisition. The Spanish domain in North America reached its greatest extent under Charles.  In 1779, Charles joined forces with France and declared war on England, which was currently dealing with its rebellious colonies. He thus aided the American quest for independence, despite his fear that the revolution might spread to his own American colonies.  "
99933,"Born Madrid, Spain    In 1779 Charles III, the king of Spain, made a formal strategic alliance with France and declared war on England. In engaging the British militarily, Charles was in effect aiding the American quest for independence, despite his fear that the revolution might spread to his own American colonies. His goal was to remove the British from the region surrounding the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River. Under the leadership of General Bernardo de Gálvez, Spanish forces were successful in expelling the British from this territory.  This earlier print shows Charles surrounded by the ancient treasures of Herculaneum, the ruins of which were excavated during his reign. Charles was interested both in the wonders of the past and the present welfare of his subjects. He modernized Madrid and severely curbed the power of the Inquisition. The Spanish domain in North America reached its greatest extent under Charles's rule."
99943,"Born Baltimore, Maryland   At the 2004 Olympics, nineteen-year-old swimming phenomenon Michael Phelps dominated the competition, breaking six Olympic records and one world record to become the only American to win eight medals in a single Olympiad. Phelps’s performance in Athens and his subsequent victories have led many to call him the greatest all-around competitor in the sport’s history. Declaring, ""I’d like to break a record every single time I go out in the water,"" Phelps continues to add to his medal count. Hailed as ""superhuman"" by his competitors, Phelps set his sights on the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he won eight gold medals—setting world records with the seventh and an Olympic record with the eighth.  Photographer Ryan McGinley captured Phelps with an underwater camera for a piece in the New York Times Magazine about the 2004 U.S. Olympic swim team."
99964,"The first of the post-World War II baby boomers to sit in the White House, Bill Clinton came to national political attention when, at age thirty-two, he claimed the Arkansas governorship. He later served an additional ten years as governor. Clinton's political resilience earned him the 1992 Democratic presidential nomination and the presidential victory in November.   During his presidency, Clinton's resilience continued to be his mainstay. In the face of several controversies, he maintained his credibility with the electorate. The most ambitious initiative of his presidency was an attempt to overhaul the nation's health care system. That effort failed, but Clinton could claim accomplishments on other fronts, including a role in reshaping the nation's public welfare system. His administration also played a crucial part in curbing the massive federal spending deficits that had soared out of control in the 1980s; during his second term the government had a surplus in revenues for the first time since the late 1960s.  "
99990,"In the years immediately following the Battle of the Little Bighorn, many Americans believed that Rain-in-the-Face was responsible for killing George A. Custer, the renowned commander of the Seventh Cavalry. Contributing to this story's popularity, poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow immortalized the Lakota warrior in a poem about Custer's last stand titled ""The Revenge of Rain-in-the-Face."" Although Rain-in-the-Face did participate in this and other battles, he later distanced himself from this claim, explaining ""in that fight the excitement was so great that we scarcely recognized our nearest friends."" Deciding to relocate to Canada with Sitting Bull's followers after the battle, Rain-in-the-Face ultimately surrendered to federal authorities in 1880. For the remainder of his life, he lived on the Standing Rock Reservation. The cabinet card shown here is one in a series of portraits of famous Native American warriors assembled by photographer David F. Barry.  "
100002,"As a critic, novelist, and political activist, Susan Sontag was one of the leading public intellectuals during an era dominated by male voices. Striking in looks and intellect, Sontag was sultry, brilliant, and precocious. She became an international cultural icon with the publication of her 1964 essay ""Notes on ‘Camp,’"" a study of the aesthetics of popular culture, and later wrote incisively about such diverse topics as photography, human rights, and the AIDS crisis. Throughout her life Sontag was dedicated to freedom of expression and the advancement of literature, which she declared ""the passport to enter a larger life; that is, the zone of freedom."" Her rejection of conventions and limitations, and her desire to accomplish what she deemed ""self-transcendence,"" coincided with the emergence of 1960s counterculture. In this portrait Peter Hujar captures a sense of her dreaminess, thoughtfulness, and sexuality—all themes that recur in Sontag’s writings."
100006,"Born Greene County, New York   From the 1830s until the Civil War Thurlow Weed was a dominant force in New York and American party politics, described by Henry Adams as ""the model of political management and patient address."" He entered politics through newspaper editing and writing, first becoming a supporter of New York governor DeWitt Clinton, and then rising to de facto leader of the Whig Party, signaled by effectively making William Seward governor of New York in 1838 and William Henry Harrison president in 1840. Weed dispensed favors and was not adverse to outright bribery, although he himself refused to profit from corruption. He spearheaded Zachary Taylor’s successful candidacy for president in 1848, but Taylor’s early death ruined Weed’s plans for maintaining the unity of the Whig Party. Weed then moved to the Republican Party, but his influence declined. "
100060,"Gore Vidal, a member of a prominent political family, has long been a close observer of American politics and society. A liberal social commentator and writer on current events, Vidal participated in a series of debates with William Buckley during the 1968 political conventions. Vidal is also an essayist and novelist, known for his cycle of historical novels, including Washington, D.C. (1967), Burr (1974), 1876 (1976), and Lincoln (1984). Also a playwright and screenwriter, Vidal was an uncredited ""script doctor"" for Ben Hur.   Sacha Newley painted this portrait for a series devoted to personalities in the arts. The sittings took place at Vidal's home in Ravello, Italy. At work on his memoir, Palimpsest, Vidal regaled the artist with stories of his life, including time spent with well-known Washington and Hollywood figures. Newley selected this low-angle pose to highlight Vidal's regal nature."
100061,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  In the 1850s, Elisha Kent Kane’s two daring missions in search of missing British explorer Sir John Franklin were the first American-led Arctic expeditions. During Kane’s second Arctic voyage in 1853, heavy ice trapped his ship. Icebound for a harrowing twenty-one-month period, Kane conducted geographical and meteorological surveys and developed a trade relationship with the region’s Etah Inuit. After safely leading his party overland to Greenland in the fall of 1855, Kane returned to a hero’s welcome in the United States. The published account of his expedition inspired future explorers and set an example for Arctic exploration and research. "
100074,"Born Washington, D.C.  The effervescent Florence Mills was one of the most charismatic African American performers of the 1920s. She began singing and dancing at an early age and spent a decade on the vaudeville circuit before landing a lead role in Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake’s hit show Shuffle Along in 1921. After a starring engagement at a New York nightspot, Mills captivated audiences and critics alike with her 1923 European debut in the all-black revue From Dover Street to Dixie. Fresh from this triumph, she scored another hit in Dixie to Broadway, which opened in New York in 1924 and featured her touching rendition of ""I’m a Little Blackbird Looking for a Bluebird."" The song became the inspiration for her next starring vehicle, the sensationally popular Blackbirds of 1926. When Mills died suddenly the following year, shortly after the show’s opening, an estimated 150,000 mourners lined the route of her funeral procession in Harlem."
100076,"Born New York City     Perhaps best known for his role as Superman, actor Christopher Reeve went on to become a powerful voice for people living with disabilities after a 1995 equestrian accident left him paralyzed from the neck down. Reeve lived his life according to his own definition of a hero—“an ordinary individual who finds strength to persevere and endure in spite of overwhelming obstacles.” His advocacy efforts led to the passage of the 1999 Work Incentives Improvement Act, allowing people with disabilities to return to work and still receive disability benefits. He also served as chairman of the board of the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation, which supports research to develop effective treatments and cures for paralysis caused by spinal cord injury and other central nervous system disorders."
100077,"Born Oceanside, New York    In 1989, American virologist Harold Varmus was the co-winner, with J. Michael Bishop, of the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his study of the origins of cancer. In 2001, he received the National Medal of Science. Jon Friedman created this charcoal drawing of Varmus as a study for an oil portrait commissioned by the National Institutes of Health-where Varmus served as director from 1993 to 1999-on the occasion of his retirement. The study demonstrates the portraitist's keen attention to articulating the scientist's genial expression and folded hands, features that characterize the scientist in Friedman's final oil portrait. The background of the finished work includes a reproduction of Jacques-Louis David's celebrated 1788 painting of the famed French scientist Antoine Laurent Lavoisier-who identified oxygen-and Lavoisier's wife. This testifies to the Varmuses' interest in intersections between art and science and creates a powerful resonance between past and present. "
100080,"A distinguished biochemist, Maxine Singer earned the National Medal of Science in 1992 and led the Carnegie Institution from 1988 to 2002. Her groundbreaking research on DNA has improved our understanding of the development and structure of such genetic diseases as hemophilia. Singer notes that such experimentation, for which she helped devise ethical guidelines, ""bring[s] closer the day when the ability to manipulate genetic material can be used for improving the lives of all humans.""  Jon Friedman's study for a portrait commissioned by the Carnegie Institution reflects Singer's wide-ranging interests, from DNA to astronomy. Her influential Genes and Genomes (1990, with Paul Berg) appears beside a model of the Carnegie's Giant Magellan Telescope. Her family is pictured in the lower left, while Singer encourages two youngsters in the image directly below her book, illustratingher commitment to science education and public service. "
100090,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    Thomas E. Kirby, the art dealer and auctioneer with ""the million-dollar voice,"" began his career in 1858 as a twelve-year-old assistant at a Philadelphia auction house. In 1883 he was one of the three founders of the American Art Association (AAA), a firm that soon came to dominate the New York gallery trade. The AAA sponsored five ""Prize Fund"" exhibitions, open only to American artists (one of whom was William Merritt Chase, the painter of this work). Ind 1886 the AAA displayed the first collection of French impressionist paintings seen in the United States. By the 1890s, Kirby was the sole active partner in AAA and concentrated exclusively on the auction business. His integrity and flair for showmanship-which included the production of lavish catalogs-attracted sellers and buyers of the highest caliber and made his evening auctions exciting events.  "
100091,"  Ansel Adams's breathtaking images of the American landscape earned him acclaim as one of the twentieth century's great photographers. A catalyst in gaining recognition of photography as a fine art medium, Adams joined photographer Edward Weston and five others in 1932 to found Group f.64?an informal association of West Coast camera artists who championed the sharp-focus, modernist aesthetic known as ""straight"" photography. First introduced in 1928, Adams and Weston became lifelong friends. They corresponded, exchanged prints, consulted one another on technical matters, and occasionally photographed together. In the spring of 1943, while Adams was visiting Weston at the latter's home in California's Carmel Highlands, the two photographers made portraits of each other. When Weston later sent Adams two of the resulting portrait prints, Adams responded enthusiastically, writing, ""I like them tremendously; it's the first time anyone ever got a true mood through my face."""
100095,"Bernard Malamud was the author of such seminal works as The Natural and The Assistant, as well as The Fixer, which received the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. His writings frequently have Jewish settings in both America and old Europe and become allegories about timeless moral questions. The Natural, made into a movie starring Robert Redford, is ostensibly about baseball, but is actually an Old Testament fable about fate.   Malamud often visited art galleries with his longtime friend, artist Karl Schrag, best known for his cityscape and landscape prints. Malamud wrote in 1984 that Schrag's work ""expresses a deep connection with nature. . . . I derive much pleasure from his green and indigo trees and the masses of golds that emerge like large flowers."" Schrag used a similarly expressionist palette for this portrait of Malamud and for two others also owned by the Portrait Gallery."
100115,"After beginning his artistic career as a portrait painter, Henry Kirke Brown became a sculptor and created portraits in marble and bronze, several of which are in the National Portrait Gallery collection. After four years of study in Europe, where he also developed an interest in sculpting Native American subjects, Brown returned to the United States in 1848 and traveled west, visiting tribes on Mackinac Island in Michigan. Several important works resulted from this trip, including a large bronze, Indian and Panther, which is now unlocated. A plaster model for this piece, lauded during his lifetime as his best work, is visible in the background of Louis Lang's small cabinet portrait. Lang and Brown had known each other since the mid-1840s, when both artists were studying in Rome."
100121,"On March 10, 1973, leaders of the American Indian Movement (AIM) celebrated a short-lived victory when federal authorities who had encircled the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, agreed to pull back from their positions. Two weeks earlier, Dennis Banks, Russell Means, and nearly 200 armed followers had occupied this small town on the Pine Ridge Reservation, where in 1890 more than 350 Lakota men, women, and children had died during a conflict with the U.S. Army. Having founded AIM in 1968, Banks and Means had come to Wounded Knee in their ongoing campaign to publicize the plight of Native Americans and to spur an investigation into policies at the Bureau of Indian Affairs. As at previous stand-offs, tensions ran high, and authorities feared open warfare. This photograph shows Banks (left) and Means smoking pipes during a prayer ceremony that followed news of the withdrawal.  "
100172,"Edward C. Africanus was the pastor of the Macedonia Church in Flushing, New York, part of the greater African Methodist Episcopal Church and allegedly a station on the Underground Railroad. Probably published as a memorial print, this lithograph of Africanus would have been available to his parish shortly after his untimely death. The highly particularized details of hair, clothing, and hands indicate that the print was copied from a daguerreotype. Before the introduction of the first photographic technologies, portraitists typically subordinated wrinkles and skin flaws and downplayed the hands, hair, and clothes to focus on the face. But the print of Africanus, carefully delineating such specifics as the knuckles and veins of the hands, shows a new attitude toward detail in daguerreian-age portraiture. As one magazine noted: ""the more minutely we see, the more we see."""
100173,"This advertisement features a daguerreotypist at work in his handsomely appointed studio. As a young woman poses for her portrait, the daguerreotypist consults his pocket watch to time the exposure of the plate in his camera.  "
100180,"During the 1953 inaugural parade, cowboy legend and rodeo entertainer ""Montie Montana"" lassoed Dwight D. Eisenhower as the new president stood on the reviewing stand. Although the crowd and photographers delighted in Eisenhower's good-natured response, members of the president's Secret Service detail were not amused. Montana's stunt was the highlight of a parade that lasted five hours.   As one of the most popular and famous generals of World War II, Eisenhower entered the presidency on the heels of a successful military career. After a tough political battle with Senator Robert A. Taft for the Republican nomination, Eisenhower fared well in the general election against Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson, winning thirty-nine of forty-eight states. During his two-term presidency, Eisenhower focused on maintaining peace and improving foreign relations with Russia.   "
100242,"Born Green Forest, Arkansas     Helen Gurley Brown is best remembered as the dynamic editor who took charge of the moribund Cosmopolitan magazine in 1965 and transformed it into a best-selling publication aimed at young professional women. Brown first gained national attention in 1962 with the publication of Sex and the Single Girl, her candid take on “how to stay single in superlative style.” For the traditionally minded, this title was an oxymoron at the very least. But the book flew off bookstore shelves and struck a positive chord with early advocates of what would become the sexual revolution. Under Brown’s leadership, Cosmopolitan soon emerged as a major outlet for the liberated single woman who came to epitomize the “Cosmo Girl.” By the time of Brown’s retirement in 1997 after thirty-two years at Cosmo’s helm, the magazine’s circulation had reached three million, an increase of more than 300 percent."
100243,"As banned American films finally arrived in Italy after World War II, the revived Italian poster industry turned out spectacular advertising, such as this image for the 1946 spy thriller Notorious. Director Alfred Hitchcock had paired for the first time two of his favorite actors of the 1940s, Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. In the film, which was both a popular and critical success in America, Hitchcock exposed the darker side of Grant's personality, focusing more on psychological tensions than on action scenes to further the suspense. The poster, however, features the love triangle between Grant, Bergman, and Claude Rains, who had won an Academy Award nomination for his depiction of a pro-Nazi spy. Especially effective in this poster is the unusual addition of Hitchcock himself, depicted here in a controlling, puppeteer-like pose.   "
100245,"The manic face of Jack Nicholson in an Italian poster for One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest encapsulated that wicked wink-and-grin personality that brought the actor cult status as film’s preeminent “bad-boy” antihero. In the 1975 dramatization of Ken Kesey’s best-selling novel, Nicholson played a minor offender who tries to outwit prison officials by pretending to need psychiatric care and is eventually lobotomized. The movie swept the Oscars, winning all of the major awards, including Nicholson’s first for Best Actor. Depicting Nicholson during a pivotal scene, this poster borrows the implications of Michelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film Blow-Up in deploying multiple, expanding boxes to suggest the pulsations of electric shock treatment. One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest coincides with efforts in the 1970s to advocate for the rights of mental health patients."
100247,"Born Detroit, Michigan  Diana Ross achieved international stardom as the lead singer of the Supremes, the most successful female group in pop music history. Along with trio members Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard, she made such songs as ""Stop in the Name of Love"" an indelible sound of her generation; during the 1960s, only the Beatles sold more records. Described as a ""total entertainer,"" Ross electrified audiences with a voice that could put ""swerves into the most unsupple lyrics."" In 1970 she left the group to pursue a solo career as a singer and an actress.  The vivacious singer needed no identifying name in this Blackglama advertising poster. A highly successful use of celebrity endorsement, the fur campaign was launched in 1968 with a simple formula: a black and white photograph of a glamorous, recognizable star wrapped in mink with the tantalizing caption ""What becomes a Legend most?"""
100248,"When the Great Lakes Mink Association asked New York advertiser Jane Trahey to rehabilitate the fur industry after a sharp decline in the 1960s, she conceived the famous Blackglama advertising campaign. Launched in 1968, the series of posters paired Richard Avedon's photographs of such mink-garbed celebrities as Bette Davis with the tantalizing caption ""What becomes a Legend most?"" No identifying name was necessary. Within two years, Blackglama was the most prestigious black ranch mink in the world, the fur industry was thriving, and stars clamored to become a ""legend"" and take home a mink coat. Bette Davis was in the initial series of posters. The agency representative remembered her nonstop smoking in the car en route to Avedon's studio. But she was a pro. ""Ten cigarettes later,"" he recalled, ""we had captured the legend."""
100251,"Advertising agency associate Peter Rogers had the job of escorting the stars as they came into town for their Blackglama photo shoots. ""Managing"" Judy Garland turned out to be a challenge. She had stayed up most of the previous night, joining Tony Bennett at his performance at the Waldorf and visiting with him afterward. When Rogers called for Garland the next morning to take her to Avedon's studio, the hotel room was a disaster, littered with empty vodka bottles and feathers from a pillow fight with a friend. But Garland pulled herself together, and by the time her hair and makeup had been done, she ""looked terrific."" She sang along with one of her records and the photo session went well. Ultimately, however, they chose a non-performing shot: ""somehow,"" Rogers remembered, ""it seemed to capture the Garland image more poignantly."""
100268,"With a commission from the New York Times Magazine for a cover portrait, Andy Warhol visited Plains, Georgia, in 1976 to make Polaroid photographs of presidential candidate Jimmy Carter. Subsequently, Warhol also made silkscreen prints of Carter to sell through the Democratic National Committee. This powerful, inventive drawing is related to those representations yet entirely different. Warhol projected a photograph onto the paper, traced around it, and then subverted the contour with nervous, squiggled lines. Unlike the painting and prints of Carter, which were designed for public consumption, this brooding image remained in Warhol's possession. Looking behind the famous campaign smile and subtracting facial detail, Warhol explores more enigmatic aspects of Carter's personality. With its furrowed brow, syncopated lines, and lack of color, this portrait deemphasizes celebrity glamour, insinuating perhaps a darker effect of the political spotlight.  "
100275,"Everyone knows cigarettes are unhealthy, but they are still powerful symbols of both sophistication and intelligence. The African American painter Beauford Delaney made this pastel drawing of his friend, the poet May Swenson, in 1960. Even though everyone, it seems, smoked back then, the addition of the cigarette also enhances the edginess of the portrait. Just as Delaney was a realist painter in an age of abstraction, Swenson was interested in conveying depth through an intense evocation of the surface of things, a goal similar to Elizabeth Bishop’s. Swenson wrote that she desired ""to get through the curtain of things as they appear, to things as they are, and then into the larger, wilder space of things as they are becoming."" A westerner, born in Utah to a family that spoke Swedish at home (she had translated the poems of Tomas Tranströmer into English), Swenson became especially well known for her landscape poems and love poems. "
100322,"With six Olympic medals to her credit, Jackie Joyner-Kersee is the most decorated woman athlete in U.S. Olympic track and field history. Excelling in the heptathlon, a grueling two-day, seven-event competition comprising the 100-meter hurdles, high jump, shot put, 200 meters, long jump, javelin, and 800 meters, Joyner-Kersee won the silver medal in her first Olympics in 1984 and later captured heptathlon gold in both the 1988 and 1992 Olympiads. She completed her medal tally with a gold (1988) and two bronzes (1992 and 1996) in Olympic long-jump competition. Along the way, Joyner-Kersee not only succeeded in setting records that remain unchallenged to this day but did so while battling the asthma that repeatedly threatened to sideline her. Speaking of the rigors of her sport, she observed, ""I don't think being an athlete is unfeminine. I think of it as a kind of grace.""  "
100324,"Brooklyn Dodgers 1955  In the 1940s and 1950s, Branch Rickey, the co-owner of the Brooklyn, Dodgers, assembled one of the greatest teams in baseball history. This team picture from 1955—the year Brooklyn won its only World Series—includes Pee Wee Reese, Carl Furillo, Gil Hodges, Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Don Newcombe, and Carl Erskine. At the team’s heart, however, was Major League Baseball’s first African American player, Jackie Robinson (back row, standing at far right). Rickey carefully selected Robinson (1919–1972) to “break the color barrier,” not only because of “Robbie’s” talent, but because he had faith in Robinson’s inner strength. He made Robinson promise not to respond for one year to racist taunts from fans and players. Robinson was rookie of the year in 1947. In his ten years as a Brooklyn Dodger, he led the team to six pennants and a World Series victory and ended his career with a batting average of .311. "
100328,"As a teenager in Poland, David Dubinsky was exiled to Siberia for his union activities. By 1911, he had immigrated to New York City, where he worked in the clothing industry, and joined the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union. With characteristic energy, he rose through the ranks and was elected the union's president in 1932. A fierce champion for his workers, Dubinsky battled during the 1930s to keep the ILGWU out of the hands of both organized crime and the Communist Party. Under his leadership, the union established a standard thirty-five-hour work week and focused on the workers' education. The ILGWU commissioned Dubinsky's portrait from John Sloan, who used distinctive cross-hatching and glazes to highlight his figures. He originally intended to omit these lines for a commissioned portrait, but Dubinsky's daughter, who has given the painting to the Gallery, persuaded him to retain them.  "
100336,"Perhaps no other American artist of the past fifty years has experimented so creatively with such diverse materials and techniques as Robert Rauschenberg. Coming of age in the era of abstract expressionism, Rauschenberg sought during the 1950s to infuse art-making with new possibilities. In his so-called ""combine paintings"" of this period, he created collages and assemblages with objects he found in his lower Manhattan neighborhood. One famous sculpture included a stuffed goat with an old tire hanging around its neck. As he has exclaimed, ""I'm for 'yes.' 'No' excludes. I'm for inclusion."" Not content with one approach or one medium, Rauschenberg has been at the forefront of innovations in painting, sculpture, lithography, and performance. Renowned fine-art photographer Irving Penn created this portrait in 2005, on the eve of a major Rauschenberg exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art."
100337,"Overcoats #1  William Beckman  born 1942    ""I tend to include in my paintings [items of] autobiographical significance,"" comments William Beckman, although the artist does not regard himself as a storyteller and does not intend for all items to be easily deciphered. With a nod to Grant Wood's American Gothic and Nikolai Gogol's short story ""The Overcoat,"" Beckman, who appears with Jeannie Zetterstrand, introduces autobiographical currents into Overcoats #1, a study for Overcoats: American Modern. Like Wood, Beckman lived in Iowa, where he attended school. As a student, he read Gogol. He explains, ""the overcoats have to do with exposure to society. A closed coat is about protection and hands in pocket convey a similar message."" During his career, Beckman has repeatedly depicted himself, suggesting ongoing self-examination. ""This is about survival,"" the artist says of his use of overcoats. The statement might even apply to self-portrayal. "
100339,"Born Boston, Massachusetts   When Massachusetts Governor John Andrew organized the North’s first regiment of African American troops, Robert Gould Shaw was offered the commission of colonel to head the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts Infantry. After a brief period of training, the novice regiment of black volunteers was thrown into action in the occupation of the Sea Islands off of South Carolina. The regiment did not perform well and its role in the subsequent burning of Darien, Georgia, aroused controversy in the North and outrage in the South. On July 18, 1863, the Fifty-Fourth made its reputation with a courageous and doomed frontal attack on Fort Wagner, outside of Charleston. Shaw was killed, one of 272 casualties. The attack validated the African American presence in the military and was a powerful propaganda tool against the South. Shaw became a legendary figure, admired for his selflessness and sacrifice."
100347,"Writer and political activist Gloria Steinem emerged as a powerful voice for women's rights at a time when many Americans viewed feminism solely as a ""white middle-class movement."" In provocative articles such as ""After Black Power, Women's Liberation"" (1969), Steinem argued that inclusiveness across racial and economic boundaries was fundamental to the campaign for gender equality. To underscore the point that all women, regardless of race or class, had a stake in this struggle, Steinem joined forces with leading child-care advocate Dorothy Pitman Hughes. In 1970 they embarked on a series of high-profile national speaking tours to galvanize grassroots support for women's issues. In this formal studio portrait published in Esquire magazine in October 1971, Steinem and Hughes signal their solidarity with the raised-fist salute first popularized by members of the Black Power movement.  "
100351,"Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis first met while performing in the play Jeb in 1946. Although the play flopped, their relationship thrived. Following their marriage in 1948, Dee and Davis gradually built up a reputation in movies, theater, and television as one of American entertainment's most distinguished couples. While experiencing many successes separately, some of their greatest moments were shared, including their stage performances in Raisin in the Sun and Purlie Victorious, which Davis also wrote and later turned into a hit musical. The long list of their achievements also included the hit movie Cotton Comes to Harlem, which Davis both wrote and directed, and their performances in Spike Lee's film Do the Right Thing. In 1989, Dee and Davis became inductees into the NAACP's Image Awards Hall of Fame, and in 2004 they received the Kennedy Center Honors award."
100352,"The controversial American poet and writer Amiri Baraka was known as LeRoi Jones until 1968 when, as a consequence of his estrangement from America and his adoption of black nationalist politics, he converted to Islam. From its beginnings in the 1950s, Baraka’s poetry was always political, as he used it to chart the history of black oppression in America. Stylistically he was influenced by Beat poets like Allen Ginsberg, writing incantatory, ecstatic verse that he directed toward the cause of African American rebellion; at one point he explicitly said he did not write to, nor did he want, a white audience. Yet a series of powerfully wrought works like Blues People (1963) and Slave Ship (1970) forced America to reckon with both Baraka and the cause he represented."
100353,"Ntozake Shange's poetry, plays, and prose reflect her fierce commitment to empowering women of color by telling their stories, honoring their struggles, and celebrating their strength. Reared in a culturally rich but sheltered environment, Shange was shaken by the racism she encountered in society. The anger and alienation that prompted her to attempt suicide at age nineteen would later be channeled into her most compelling work. In the early 1970s, after renouncing her birth, or ""slave,"" name (Paulette Williams) in favor of an African one meaning ""she who comes with her own things/she who walks like a lion,"" Shange began developing a performance piece rooted in the experiences of contemporary black women. When her groundbreaking ""choreopoem,"" For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow is Enuf, reached Broadway in 1976, it was hailed for its powerful and passionate storytelling."
100360,"Businessman and art collector Charles Freer made his fortune in the railroad industry as a railcar and equipment manufacturer in Detroit. After retiring from business in 1900, Freer focused his energies on further developing the superb art collection he had begun assembling in the 1880s. A friend and patron of artist James McNeill Whistler, Freer avidly collected his work. He also developed a passionate interest in Near and Far Eastern art, and amassed extraordinary holdings ranging from Persian manuscripts and Buddhist sculpture to Chinese paintings and Korean ceramics. In 1906 the Smithsonian accepted Freer's gift of his collection, as well as funds for the building that would become the Freer Gallery.   Freer and Steichen were most likely introduced in 1914 by their mutual friends Eugene and Agnes Meyer. By the time Freer commissioned this portrait, his engagement diary recorded numerous contacts with the photographer."
100373,"In the late 1930s and 1940s, Norman Corwin earned recognition as radio's poet laureate and the premier writer and producer of radio theater in its golden age of drama. Recruited by the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1938 to explore radio's creative potential through innovative programming, Corwin created a series of landmark productions characterized by their intelligence and sophistication. To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Bill of Rights in 1941, Corwin wrote the stirring radio play We Hold These Truths-a star-studded program that reached an audience of sixty million when it aired simultaneously on the nation's four major networks just eight days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The high point of Corwin's broadcasting career came four years later, on May 8, 1945, when he marked the Allied victory in Europe with On a Note of Triumph, a lyrical tribute that has been called one of the finest works ever written for radio."
100497,"The presidential election of 1800 was the first in which political parties (Federalists and Democratic-Republicans) faced off. The resulting gridlock changed the way we elect presidents and vice presidents. Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr ran as Republicans, with the understanding that Jefferson was running for president and Burr for vice president. However, members of the Electoral College voted only for president: the candidate with the highest total would become president; the second highest, vice president. A tie vote threw the election into the House of Representatives. After thirty-five ballots, James Bayard of Delaware abstained from voting, making Jefferson president. This election precipitated the Twelfth Amendment, ratified in 1804, which provided separate ballots for president and vice president.   "
100549,"Ending the war in Vietnam was the one truly intractable problem that President Nixon had to cope with upon taking office in 1969. In October of that year, Time’s cover story explored several options, including just pulling out. But to do so would be sending mixed messages about America’s resolve in fighting communism, as well as undermining the human sacrifices of those who had died in the war thus far. Instead, Nixon pursued a policy of “peace with honor,” which involved a gradual troop withdrawal and a cease-fire agreement with North Vietnam in early 1973.  ¿Y si nos retiramos?      Poner fin a la guerra de Vietnam fue el único problema verdaderamente inabordable que tuvo que afrontar el presidente Nixon al tomar posesión de su cargo en 1969. En octubre de ese año, Time exploró diversas opciones, incluida la de retirar las tropas. Sin embargo, esto habría dado señales equívocas respecto a la firmeza de Estados Unidos en la lucha contra el comunismo, además de socavar la importancia del sacrificio de los que habían muerto en la guerra hasta ese momento. Nixon optó por una política de “paz con honor”, que conllevó el retiro gradual de las tropas y un acuerdo de cese al fuego con Vietnam del Norte a principios de 1973.

100564,"Bernarda Bryson Shahn spent her long life as an artist, writer, and activist. While working as a journalist in her native Ohio, she traveled to New York to interview the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. There she met Rivera's assistant, Ben Shahn, and the two became a couple, living together for nearly thirty years before marrying at the end of Ben Shahn's life. During the 1930s they traveled through the United States, documenting rural life for the Resettlement Administration; both artists made posters and prints based on this experience. Peter Paone was Ben Shahn's assistant around 1955, and afterward continued to be close to the couple, co-curating an exhibition of Bernarda's prints in 2001. Paone's intimate painting reveals Bernarda Shahn's vivacity in the face of great age."
100696,"No entertainer enjoyed greater popularity in American life than comedian Bob Hope. Beginning his career in vaudeville, Hope combined a rapid-fire delivery with an encyclopedic memory for jokes to become one of the best ad-libbers in show business. Everything seems out of whack in Al Hirschfeld's 1975 portrayal, drawn for NBC to celebrate Hope's contributions to the network. But Hope did stretch his chin sideways, leer mischievously out of the corners of his eyes, and arch his eyebrows to ridiculous heights. In addition to keen characterization, Hirschfeld implies a sense of movement, as if those whiplashing lines will soon explode and turn into someone else. The caricature conveys Hope's own lively, unabating joy in performance that ensured his popularity. ""I feel better when I come off the stage than I do when I go on,"" he once admitted. "
100701,"A founder of modern public relations and advertising techniques, Benjamin Sonnenberg shaped advertising as a proactive process that created a market in advance of the availability of a product. One of his partners characterized him as ""a conceptual thinker with an extraordinary ability to analyze what was happening in the world of public perception."" Sonnenberg also cut a wide figure in New York City's social circles as a bon vivant and patron of the arts.   Sonnenberg's lavish lifestyle in his Gramercy Park mansion and ebullient personality have been successfully depicted here by René Bouché, who has included many of Sonnenberg's favorite items: brass objects from his vast collection, books, photographs, clocks, and, on a side table, two telephones. According to Geoffrey Hellman's 1950 New Yorker profile of the advertising executive, ""the polishing of these [brass] items constitutes the principal occupation of the Sonnenberg houseman."""
100706,"Frank O'Hara was one of the most important poets of mid-twentieth-century America. Rejecting abstraction and theoretical posturing, he was a leading figure in making poetry more confessional, intimate, and personal. Also an active participant in the art scene of his era, O'Hara wrote for art periodicals and frequently socialized and collaborated with artists, a number of whom drew or painted his handsome features. One painter recalled that O'Hara was extroverted, funny, and generous, and ""he became your friend in about six seconds.""  Don Bachardy drew his strangely haunting portrait the year before O'Hara's untimely death at age forty. Bachardy's usual practice is to draw one eye and scale the rest of the picture around it, exploiting the immediacy and tension of acute observation. He sees the process as an ""exchange of energy"" between two personalities at a particular moment. "
100769,"In the wake of the first one hundred days of Franklin Roosevelt's administration, which saw the blizzard of legislation designed to pull America out of the Great Depression, sculptor Reuben Nakian came to Washington to portray the chief of the new National Recovery Administration. Shortly afterward, eight other New Deal cabinet members and agency officials agreed that the artists might model them as they worked. An appointment with the busy president, however, could not be arranged, and Nakian worked from photographs to create this image of a vibrant, confident leader.  "
100771,"Born New Orleans, Louisiana    The drawings of prolific Kansas City-born caricaturist Ralph Barton, published in the leading magazines of the jazz age, helped define his era. Barton claimed to have drawn so many celebrities that he ""must now wait for new subjects to be born."" For the early twentieth-century humor magazine Life, Barton reduced the august actress Minnie Maddern Fiske to a vicious old scold. But in fact, at this stage of her career, Fiske was acclaimed as an innovator. With her husband she had managed her own theater in New York City; she had successfully resisted the monopoly of theatrical syndicates; and she had emphasized ensemble acting rather than a star system. As a champion of the works of Henrik Ibsen and his followers, Fiske also helped introduce plays that treated modern problems with psychological depth."
100871,"By the time he was recruited for Francis Ford Coppola's 1979 Apocalypse Now, the influential but controversial actor Marlon Brando had become almost a parody of himself. Although he was paid generously for his relatively small role in this Vietnam-era war epic, he arrived for the shoot grossly overweight and ill-prepared. Nonetheless, Brando, playing Colonel Kurtz, a Special Forces officer driven mad by the moral ambiguity and unendurable horror of war, looms at the heart of the film in Coppola's vision, as this poster suggests. Brando shaved his head for the role, and his partially improvised monologue is filmed in a surreal, shadowy close-up. Despite the director's problems with Brando, Coppola conceded the importance of his role. The big scene of this adventure-action movie, he claimed, ""is not another helicopter battle, but it's a guy, a face, alone in a dark room, telling the truth.""   "
100959,"On being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1993, Toni Morrison was honored as an author who ""in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality."" Drawing upon both her own life and historical accounts, Morrison has crafted stories and essays that speak broadly about such issues as marginality, exclusion, and belonging. A graduate of Howard University, she taught English before becoming an editor at Random House in 1965. There, Morrison helped to develop the careers of several African American authors while simultaneously beginning to publish her own writings. Helen Marcus created this portrait to help publicize Song of Solomon, which was named as a Book-of-the-Month selection, the first such distinction by an African American author since Richard Wright's Native Son in 1940. Morrison retired in 2006 after seventeen years on the faculty of Princeton University."
101232,"Born Wenonah, New Jersey    Planetary scientist Steve Squyres has advanced the American space program through his pioneering role in launching unmanned missions to Mars. The Goldwin Smith Professor of Astronomy at Cornell University, Squyres is the principal scientist of NASA’s Mars Exploration Rover mission, launched in 2003.  Photographers Susan Gamble and Michael Wenyon created this panoramic image of Squyres in May 2005 by seamlessly “stitching” together a series of digital images. Taken in the scientist’s office at Cornell, the portrait depicts Squyres as he participates in a conference call with members of the Mars mission team. Seventeen months earlier, the Mars Exploration Rovers had landed and begun what was understood at the time to be a ninety-day mission. However, defying all expectations, the two rovers, named Spirit and Opportunity, continued to provide important information after their expected life spans. "
101268,"Patricia McBride born 1942  Born Teaneck, New Jersey  Edward Villella born 1936  Born New York City  Patricia McBride joined the New York City Ballet (NYCB) in 1959, and her glamour and versatility inspired George Balanchine to create many works for her, including roles in A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Harlequinade, Coppelia, Pavane, and The Four Seasons. In 1996 she became associate artistic director and master teacher of the North Carolina Dance Theatre.  Edward Villella joined the NYCB in 1957 and originated many roles with the company. His most famous performance was in the 1960 revival of Balanchine’s 1929 masterpiece, Prodigal Son. From 1985 to 2012, he was founding artistic director of the Miami City Ballet.  The hallmark of the McBride-Villella partnership at NYCB was the way in which they conveyed their sheer delight in dancing. At the height of their pairing in 1967, the New York Times reviewed their performance of Harlequinade: “Everyone danced like a dream.”"
101271,"Christopher ""Kit"" Carson was a legendary yet controversial figure whose career as a mountain man and an army officer in the Southwest earned him national acclaim. Carson first gained notoriety working under explorer John C. Frémont. Serving on three Frémont-led expeditions during the 1840s, he distinguished himself for his skills as a hunter and a guide. Despite being illiterate, he was fluent in several languages and was able to communicate with many Native American tribes in the region. During the Civil War, Carson commanded a Union regiment, successfully defending New Mexico from Confederate invaders. Also at this time he was called upon to lead a campaign to relocate the Navajo to a reservation three hundred miles away on the Pecos River. The 1864 ""Long Walk"" to Bosque Redondo-during which more than two hundred died-represented one of the largest forced relocations in U.S. history."
101272,"I have tried to get from my Great Father what is right and just, exclaimed Red Cloud to government officials at the conclusion of his first trip to the East in 1870. Two years earlier the celebrated Lakota leader had forced U.S. authorities to abandon a series of newly constructed forts meant to protect settlers moving across traditional Native lands. Beginning in 1870, however, Red Cloud would choose diplomacy, not warfare, to protect the Lakota's land base and to ensure the tribe's political and cultural independence. Although the westward migration of American settlers would continue largely unabated, Red Cloud remained dedicated to the future welfare of the Lakota, meeting with five different U.S. presidents over a period of thirty years. Washington photographer Charles M. Bell seated Red Cloud next to a papier-mâché rock and a painted seascape backdrop for this portrait taken during one of his many trips to the nation's capital."
101273,"Born Lexington, Kentucky  Elected to Congress in 1851, John C. Breckinridge wielded an influential voice in debates regarding the future of slavery. An ardent foe of restrictions placed on slavery’s expansion by the Compromise of 1850, Breckinridge played a key role in securing passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act (1854)—a controversial measure allowing Kansas and Nebraska settlers to determine whether those territories would be free or slave. In 1856 he won election as James Buchanan’s vice president; he ran unsuccessfully for president in the four-way contest of 1860. When secession came, Breckinridge sided with the South and later became the Confederate secretary of war (1865)."
101275,"Born Lexington, Kentucky  First Lady Mary Todd Lincoln was intelligent and witty—a devoted wife and an attentive mother. She was also keenly supportive of her husband’s political career and was the first to realize his potential for national leadership and the presidency. Todd wished to marry the young and relatively unestablished Lincoln contrary to the wishes of her socially prominent relatives, with whom she was living at the time of her engagement.   This photograph by Mathew Brady shows the new first lady in a festive ball gown a year before the death of her eleven-year-old son, Willie, who succumbed to typhoid fever in February 1862. Thereafter she dressed mostly in black. Willie’s death precipitated his mother’s rapid psychological decline, which became severe after the president’s assassination in April 1865."
101298,"Singer and actress Judy Garland (1922–1969) achieved fame and success early on. At age thirteen, she quickly gained popularity among studio executives through her films with costar Mickey Rooney. Garland received a special Oscar in 1940 for outstanding performances as a juvenile screen actor, including her role as Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz (1939). She continued singing and acting into adulthood, but struggled with her celebrity and addiction to diet and sleeping pills.  In this print, Andy Warhol intensified the actress’s glamour and drew attention to the artifice behind it by enlarging and cropping his source image and adding color accents. He once described Garland as “turning everything on and off in a second; she was the greatest actress you could imagine in every minute of her life.”"
101440,"Born Park Ridge, Illinois    A graduate of Wellesley College, Hillary Rodham enrolled at Yale Law School in 1969. There, she was an editor of the Yale Law Journal and met Bill Clinton, whom she married in 1975. During her husband's three terms as governor of Arkansas, she focused on child and family issues. In 1993, as the country's first lady, she chaired the Task Force on National Health Care Reform and wrote the bestseller It Takes a Village. In 2000 she was elected U.S. senator from New York-the first first lady elected to Congress-and served on several important committees. In 2007 she became the first woman to seriously contest the presidential nomination in a major political party.  President Barack Obama, who defeated her for the nomination and won the presidency, appointed her secretary of state in 2009.   Clinton chose Ginny Stanford, based in northern California, to create this, the Portrait Gallery's first commissioned portrait of a first lady. "
101521,"Paul Cadmus was trained at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League. In his paintings and drawing he celebrated and burlesqued the erotic freedom of city life, presenting scenes such as The Fleet's In! (1933), Shore Leave (1933), and Sailors and Floozies (1938), which showed men picking up women and men picking up men. The Fleet's In!, painted while Cadmus was working for the Works Progress Administration, so incensed the U.S. Navy that it demanded the painting be banned. Cadmus later said that he benefited from the controversy and was ""eternally grateful to that offended admiral."" Cadmus has become an iconic figure in the gay community, but he insisted that ""gayness is not the raison-d'etre of my work."" Friedrike Merck sculpted Cadmus at the end of his life, after meeting him at a dinner at the National Academy of Design."
101530,"In September 1915, Sara Bard Field-newly divorced from her first husband-embarked on a cross-country automobile trip from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., with the goal of promoting women's suffrage. At each stop along her route, rallies were held and signatures were added to a petition. Field often encountered suffrage opponents who heckled and disrupted these gatherings. Equally challenging were the poor road and weather conditions she endured in her open-air Oldsmobile. Four months after her departure, Field arrived at the White House, where she and fellow supporters delivered to President Woodrow Wilson more than half a million signatures to provide for a federal suffrage amendment. While Wilson did not back the amendment, this event was well received in the press and contributed to growing support that ultimately led to the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920."
101532,"Born Uvalde, Texas  Before signing a film contract with Republic Pictures in 1943, Dale Evans enjoyed modest success as a singer, performing in nightclubs and on the radio. But when Republic cast her opposite singing cowboy Roy Rogers in The Cowboy and the Senorita (1944), her career was transformed. Teamed with Rogers in more than twenty-five films between 1944 and 1951, Evans became ""Queen of the West"" to Rogers’s ""King of the Cowboys."" When the couple married on New Year’s Eve in 1947, they became off-screen partners as well. Following the wedding, Republic announced that Dale Evans would no longer play Roy Rogers’s leading lady. But after fans protested, that plan was scrapped and Evans returned to the screen with her husband. She also co-starred with him when the Roy Rogers Show debuted on television in 1951, and composed the ""Happy Trails"" theme song with which the pair closed each episode."
101537,"Born Normandy, France   Jacques Villon’s etching of his younger brother reflects the moment when Marcel Duchamp’s reputation began to eclipse Villon’s own. Villon had nurtured his brother’s artistic ambitions, enabling his participation in the 1913 Armory Show; Duchamp’s Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2, the most notorious work in the show, was largely the reason for the exhibition’s great success. In 1967 Duchamp explained how he came to be invited to the Armory Show: ""Walter Pach . . . had come to France in 1910, and he made friends with my brothers, through whom we met. Then, in 1912, when he was entrusted with the task of gathering paintings for that show, he saved a lot of room for the three of us."""
101695,"Born Atlanta, Georgia    In his early career, Vernon Jordan played an important role in the civil rights movement, heading the United Negro College Fund in the 1960s and serving as president of the National Urban League (1972-81). His contributions were primarily in the building of organizational strength and infrastructure. After being seriously wounded by a white supremacist sniper in 1980, Jordan changed his career direction from civil rights to law and politics. He became a partner in the Washington law firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauser & Feld and led President Bill Clinton's transition team. During the Clinton years, Jordan not only played an important role in that administration but became a key adviser in the Democratic Party. He is also viewed as an influential spokesman in the business world, serving on the corporate boards of such institutions as American Express and Dow Jones.  "
101794,"Diane Arbus's portrait of Coretta Scott King pictures her standing on the front lawn of her Atlanta home only a short time after the assassination of her husband, Martin Luther King Jr., in April 1968. While grieving his loss, Mrs. King continued to be involved in the campaigns that had so profoundly shaped their relationship. Two months after the assassination, she delivered the Class Day address at Harvard's graduation and used the occasion to speak out against the conflict in Vietnam, ""a war that outrages our moral sensibility and insults our political intelligence."" Several days later, from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial-where her husband had spoken so eloquently five years earlier-she called on women to ""lead the way of non-violence as a way of life."" By the year's end, she had also announced the initiative to develop a memorial in Atlanta to honor her late husband."
101795,"In terms of extraordinary, independent wealth, there is only one man-H. L. Hunt, remarked fellow billionaire J. Paul Getty in a 1967 Esquire profile of the famous Texas oilman. To accompany that article, Diane Arbus created this portrait of Hunt standing on the back lawn of his Dallas estate. Hunt was known not simply for his wealth, but also for his involvement in Republican politics. During this period he underwrote the conservative radio program ""Life Line"" and published a regular newspaper column, ""Hunt for Truth."" Born into a farming family and educated at home, Hunt began amassing his fortune in the 1930s, when he became one of the first businessmen to buy into the newly opened East Texas oilfields. Over the next two decades, Hunt Oil grew to become the largest independent oil and gas producer in the country.  "
101898,"Drawn to California by the gold rush, Galen Clark instead fell in love with the beauty of the Yosemite Valley and its surrounding forests. He built a cabin there in 1857, hoping to recover from a bout of tuberculosis. While hunting he discovered a large grove of sequoia trees nearby and named it after Mariposa County. In 1864, partially in response to Clark's promotional efforts to preserve this land, President Abraham Lincoln signed legislation granting the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove to California as park land. Clark became known at the time as the ""Guardian of Yosemite"" for his role as a guide and a protector of the valley. San Francisco photographer Carleton Watkins met Clark on one of his many trips to Yosemite and created this mammoth plate image of Clark standing next to the ""Grizzly Giant,"" one of the famous redwoods in the Mariposa Grove. "
101899,"Ben Shahn's 1956 drawing is one of a series commissioned by Edward R. Murrow and CBS producer Fred Friendly for a documentary on the legendary trumpeter, singer, and bandleader Louis Armstrong. Shahn had recently represented the United States at the Venice Biennale and been asked to give a prestigious series of lectures at Harvard. Armstrong was hitting even greater peaks of international renown. Performing in Europe in 1956, Armstrong and his band were sent by CBS on a historic side trip to Africa. In May Armstrong received worldwide attention performing for a huge crowd in Accra, Ghana. The African visit was an exhilarating experience for Armstrong, who felt especially connected to the Ghanaian people. Murrow's documentary was first edited for a television show and then released by United Artists as the documentary film Satchmo the Great (1957). "
101900,"Born Charleston, South Carolina  Octavius V. Catto gave his life in the struggle to secure civil rights for African Americans. Educated at the Colored Youth Institute in Philadelphia, where he later served on the faculty, Catto founded several major civic institutions, including Philadelphia’s Banneker Literary Institute and the Equal Rights League. During the Civil War, he worked with Frederick Douglass to recruit African Americans into the Union army. A vigorous advocate for the civil rights amendments of the Reconstruction Era, Catto was shot to death by a Democratic Party operative on October 10, 1871, the same day that African Americans were voting in the first Philadelphia election held after ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment."
101901,"The Afro-American Historical Family Record is both a personal genealogical chart and a proud pictorial history of African American advancement. Beneath symbols of national government, vignettes of an antebellum slave auction, cotton picking, and poor schools and housing on the left are contrasted with postwar scenes of free communities, industrial jobs, and prosperous schools and homes on the right. The two scenes at the bottom depict black regiments serving in Cuba during the Spanish American War. But portraiture of specific individuals plays an important role as well. Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington, educator Lucy C. Laney, and lawyer Judson Lyons are grouped with PresidentsWashington and Lincoln. Beneath the space designed for recording personal family records are ten more prominent educators, writers, editors, entertainers, and political and religious leaders, illustrating an impressive degree of accomplishment for the first post-slavery generation. "
101902,"Harriet Tubman led scores of slaves to freedom and facilitated the flight of many others after her own escape from bondage in 1849. When the Civil War began, Tubman fully committed herself to the Union cause. She traveled to South Carolina in 1862 to provide nursing care to U.S. soldiers and former slaves, and soon became a trusted army scout and spy. Operating with great effectiveness in Confederate-held territory, Tubman conducted daring reconnaissance missions, including one along the Combahee River in June 1863 that resulted in the capture of vast quantities of supplies and the liberation of more than 750 slaves."
101903,"Born Portland, Oregon  Long before it became fashionable, noted chef and cookbook author James Beard was an unapologetic champion of the virtues of American cuisine. Introduced to good eating by his mother, who was an excellent cook, Beard opened an upscale catering business in New York City in 1938 after his dreams of a stage career failed to materialize. In 1940 he published Hors d’Oeuvre and Canapés—the first of more than twenty cookbooks he would author—and in 1946 he gained a national following as the host of network television’s first cooking show, which aired on NBC. Widely recognized as ""America’s chef"" in the decades that followed, Beard achieved bestseller status with such titles as James Beard’s Cookbook (1959) and James Beard’s American Cookery (1972). In assessing Beard’s culinary legacy, Julia Child observed, ""When one thinks of American cooking, well, he started it. He popularized cooking and made people comfortable at the stove."""
101904,"Martin Luther King Jr. at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom  On August 28, 1963, more than 250,000 people gathered in the nation’s capital for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. The brainchild of longtime civil rights activist and labor leader A. Philip Randolph, the march drew support from all factions of the civil rights movement. Originally conceived as a mass demonstration to spotlight economic inequalities and press for a new federal jobs program and a higher minimum wage, the goals of the march expanded to include calls for congressional passage of the Civil Rights Act, full integration of public schools, and enactment of a bill prohibiting job discrimination. The program at the Lincoln Memorial featured an impressive roster of speakers and closed with King. Midway through his address, King abandoned his prepared text and launched into the soaring expression of his vision for the future, declaring, ""I have a dream today."""
101905,"In 1921 silent film actor Rudolph Valentino vaulted from bit player to matinee idol in the hugely popular melodrama The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Playing Julio, a dashing Argentine who meets a tragic end on a World War I battlefield, Valentino set pulses racing with his smoldering love scenes, dramatic fight sequences, and an electrifying tango. Critics praised his performance, and fans packed movie houses to see Hollywood's darkly handsome sex symbol. In subsequent films such as The Sheik (1921) and Blood and Sand (1922), Valentino burnished his reputation as a star of unrivaled box office popularity. His untimely death in 1926 only enhanced his legend, and Valentino is still regarded as one of the silver screen's greatest lovers. In this atmospheric portrait by Johan Hagemeyer, Valentino appears costumed for his role in the The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse."
101906,"Singer Mahalia Jackson created a worldwide audience for gospel music with her soul-stirring performances and immensely popular recordings. Although influenced in her youth by blues legend Bessie Smith, Jackson was unwavering in her commitment to gospel, and excluded blues and jazz from her repertoire. Church choirs served as the first showcase for her talent, but her majestic voice soon marked her for a solo career. Touring widely throughout the 1930s, Jackson thrilled audiences as she performed gospel favorites in storefront churches, tent shows, and revival meetings. Her breakthrough came in 1947, when her recording of ""Move On Up a Little Higher"" sold more than one million copies, confirming her as the ""Gospel Queen."" A fervent voice for civil rights, Jackson performed numerous benefit concerts in support of the movement and was a favorite of Martin Luther King Jr."
101907,"Born Lynbrook, New York    In his long-running role as television's kind and whimsical ""Captain Kangaroo,"" Bob Keeshan charmed several generations of youngsters with innovative programming that entertained them while it made learning fun. A pioneer in children's broadcasting, Keeshan first appeared in 1947 on the Howdy Doody Show, where he originated the character of the Clarabell, the seltzer-toting clown. In 1955 he launched the Captain Kangaroo Show on CBS and remained a fixture in the network's morning lineup for nearly thirty years. Keeshan's genial captain was markedly different from the slapstick characters associated with earlier children's programs. Instead of loud-volume buffoonery, the captain and his ""Treasure House"" cohorts such as Mr. Green Jeans (played by Hugh Brannum) and the puppets Mr. Moose and Bunny Rabbit created an atmosphere of gentle fun in which knock-knock jokes existed in harmony with explorations of music, science, and children's literature."
101908,"The Oscar-winning movie for Best Picture in 1969, Midnight Cowboy paired Dustin Hoffman-who had won stardom two years earlier in The Graduate-with the then-unknown Jon Voight. In this first mass-release movie to have an ""X"" rating, Voight plays a naïve, small-town Texas boy (Joe Buck) who runs away to New York to hustle his fortune. He winds up on the street, where he meets Hoffman's vagrant ""Ratso"" character. Their partnership in a hostile world-Joe as the gigolo/hustler, Ratso as the street manager/pimp-connects them in unlikely friendship, culminating when Joe turns ""one last trick"" to get enough money to send the dying Ratso out of New York to the city of his dreams, Miami. Both Hoffman and Voight received Best Actor Academy Award nominations, losing to John Wayne in True Grit.  This iconic photograph by Steve Shapiro was used as the movie's main advertising poster."
101909,"   Born Peoria, Illinois    As a comedian, actor, and writer, Richard Pryor became famous for defying the boundaries of taste and decency. Beginning in the late 1960s, his irreverent and often foul-mouthed stand-up performances shocked audiences. Yet it was his desire to probe difficult subjects such as race relations as much as his raunchy language that made him unique. Pryor was a prolific entertainer, appearing in more than thirty feature films and recording more than twenty albums. Although his life was marred by arrests, failed marriages, and drug abuse, he attained a level of popularity and influence unmatched by any comedian of his day. In accepting the first-ever Mark Twain Prize for Humor at the Kennedy Center in 1998, Pryor commented, ""I am proud that, like Mark Twain, I have been able to use humor to lessen people’s hatred."""
101910,"Elected governor of Alabama by a landslide in 1962, George Wallace became a defiant symbol of the South's entrenched resistance to integration. With his rallying cry ""Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever!"" Wallace fought the civil rights movement at every turn. On June 11, 1963, he fulfilled his pledge to ""stand in the schoolhouse door"" to thwart the admission of two black students to the University of Alabama, and made a great show of blocking the school's entrance before yielding to Deputy Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach (right). Although Wallace claimed to deplore violence, his rebellious stand fueled mounting racial tensions. As civil rights leader and congressman John Lewis later observed, ""Much of the bloodshed in Alabama occurred on Governor Wallace's watch. Although he never pulled a trigger or threw a bomb, he created the climate of fear and intimidation in which those acts were deemed acceptable.""  "
101912,"Diana Ross achieved international stardom as the lead singer of the Supremes. With songs such as ""Where Did Our Love Go"" and ""Stop in the Name of Love,"" the Supremes became the most successful female group in pop music history; during the 1960s, only the Beatles sold more records. Steve Schapiro's photograph pictures Ross (center) in 1965 performing on the NBC musical variety show Hullabaloo with the other two members of the famous singing trio-Mary Wilson (left) and Florence Ballard (right). Described as a ""total entertainer,"" Ross electrified audiences with a voice that could put ""swerves into the most unsupple lyrics."" In 1970 she left the group to pursue a solo career as a singer and an actress. Ross's portrayal of singer Billie Holiday in the 1972 film Lady Sings the Blues received a Best Actress Oscar nomination."
101914,"Born in England, poet Wystan Hugh Auden came to the United States in 1939 and seven years later became an American citizen. In 1947 he won the Pulitzer Prize for The Age of Anxiety, a long poem that fellow poet Marianne Moore described as a modern morality play. Richard Lahey's watercolor was exhibited under the title W. H. Auden Reading Poetry, circa 1955. Principal of the Corcoran School of Art, Lahey was a respected portraitist, watercolorist, and printmaker in a generally traditionalist mode, but here he experimented with a cubist abstraction of form. Despite the distortions, Auden, with his tweedy look and boyish haircut, is still recognizable as the energetic teacher, lecturer, and editor from the American phase of his career. In his later years, he was generally acknowledged to be one of the finest poets in the English language. "
101915,"By the time this 1953 photograph was taken, Grace Kelly had developed her screen persona as the prototypic cool blonde, first in High Noon (1952) with Gary Cooper, and the following year in Mogambo, with Clark Gable and Ava Gardner. She would win a Best Actress Academy Award in 1954 for The Country Girl, and was about to begin her notable work with Alfred Hitchcock, for whom she made Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window (1954), and To Catch a Thief (1955). In 1956 she made High Society and then retired from films to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco. She reigned thereafter as Princess Grace in the Monegasque principality until her 1982 death in an automobile accident-said to be at the spot on the Riviera where the picnic scene from To Catch a Thief was filmed."
101916,"Born Pine Ridge, South Dakota    This portrait pictures Zitkala-Ša—also known as Gertrude Bonnin—at age twenty-two, during a period when she taught at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania. Although she left Carlisle to study violin at the prestigious New England Conservatory of Music, she is best remembered not as a musician but rather as a writer and political activist. In 1900 she began publishing short stories and essays about her childhood and about the issues then affecting Native Americans. Following her marriage in 1902, she resettled in the West, where she worked for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, led community service programs, and taught school again. In 1916 Zitkala-Ša was elected the secretary of the Society of American Indians, an appointment that prompted her to move to Washington, D.C. There she worked on various Native American campaigns, including the effort that led to the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924."
101917,"Legendary blues singer Bessie Smith first made a name for herself performing in tent shows and vaudeville theaters, where audiences warmed to her powerful, earthy contralto. Smith's big break came in 1923, when she signed with Columbia and released her debut recording, ""Down Hearted Blues."" The phenomenal success of that record and those that followed established Smith as the undisputed ""Empress of the Blues."" Able to command as much as $2,000 a week at the height of her fame, Smith played to packed houses and recorded with the top jazz musicians of the day. Although her career suffered a sharp decline with the onset of the Depression and the collapse of the recording industry, Smith continued to perform until an automobile accident claimed her life in 1937. Her musical legacy has influenced countless performers, from Billie Holiday to Janis Joplin."
101919,"Born Rogers, Texas  Founded in 1958, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater showcased a vibrant choreography of ballet, modern dance, jazz, and African dance techniques. Ailey’s objective was to shape a total theatrical experience incorporating costumes, makeup, and spectacle. “What I like,” he once said, “is the line and technical range that classical ballet gives to the body. But I still want to project . . . the expressiveness that only modern dance offers.”  His remarkable 1960 production Revelations, based on nine traditional spirituals, depicted the “struggle, protest, [and] humor” of African American life. In 1971 he created the virtuoso solo work Cry for Judith Jamison as a tribute to “all black women—especially our mothers.” Jamison recalled that “it was a birthday present for Alvin’s mother. . . . We went into the studio and began moving to the music . . . and in a few days Alvin made an enduring work of art.”"
101953,"Fisher Ames, a brilliant Federalist theoretician and a renowned orator, first came to public attention with his essays on Shays's Rebellion in 1786. He was elected to the Massachusetts Constitutional convention in 1788 and, in 1789, to the United States House of Representatives, where he remained until 1797. At the time of his retirement, he was an obvious subject for pastel artist James Sharples, who had come to Philadelphia-then the nation's capital-to make portraits of prominent sitters. In 1796 Ames's eloquent defense of the Jay Treaty had helped ensure the measure's passage, permitting the resumption of commerce between Great Britain and the new United States. The treaty, initially resisted by Jeffersonian Republicans, established trading agreements, settled territorial disputes, and provided financial compensation for outstanding pre-Revolutionary debts on the part of the Americans. "
101955,"In this poster for the 1975 crime drama Dog Day Afternoon, Al Pacino's likeness looms large over a gathered crowd of police officers, FBI men, and other onlookers. Pacino did seem larger than life at the time. Portraying complex characters with a subtlety and intensity few others could match in such films as The Godfather, Serpico, and The Godfather II, he was the prototypic male star of the 1970s, bringing a sense of tough realism to his roles. Dog Day Afternoon was based on the story of a failed 1972 New York City bank robbery, which had captured media attention at the time. Pacino's performance as Sonny Wortzik, an unemployed Vietnam veteran, earned him his fourth Oscar nomination in consecutive years and the Best Actor award. His energetic portrayal of Sonny, critic Gene Siskel said, ""made me believe the unbelievable."" "
101957,"Born Phoenix, Arizona  Senator Barry Goldwater’s failed 1964 presidential campaign laid the groundwork for the subsequent triumph of Republican conservatism. Challenging the Republican establishment as a simply a pale copy of the Democrats, Goldwater provided a full-throated critique of the assumptions and shibboleths of New Deal and Great Society liberalism. Goldwater lost to Lyndon Johnson in a landslide, in part because he was depicted as a dangerous extremist who threatened prosperity at home and peace abroad through his reactionary programs. Defeated, Goldwater returned to the Senate, where he rose to the status of Washington ""wise man,"" helping usher Richard Nixon from office in 1974. He lived long enough to see his more aggressive, populist vision of the Republican Party, one based in the South and West, triumph under Ronald Reagan. "
101964,"Singer-performer Grace Jones firmly established her signature androgynous look with this iconic image advertising her 1981 Nightclubbing album and subsequent concerts. With her taut, slim body, gleaming dark skin, square-cut hair, and broad-shouldered masculine jacket with the plunging neckline, Jones satirized gender and racial stereotypes with a fashion-conscious theatricality that became part of her performance. The bold yellow background of the poster sets off the dark, gender-bending silhouette and underscores her sometimes confrontational style. Jones had been a successful model in Paris and then part of Andy Warhol's circle and the disco dance scene of New York. Her cross-dressing, use of the body, and sexualized performance all echo the complex exploitation and subversion of stereotypes by African American performer Josephine Baker in 1920s Paris. Jones's sleek, trend-setting look echoes the African-inspired geometric stylization of Baker's day, as well as the minimalist aesthetic of her own.   "
101969,"Born Boston, Massachusetts  In 1856, Mary Ann Brown Patten became the first woman to successfully sail a clipper ship around Cape Horn through the notoriously treacherous waters at the tip of South America. Schooled in navigation by her husband, Joshua Patten, the captain of Neptune’s Car, she took charge of that San Francisco–bound vessel after her husband was incapacitated by tuberculosis and the ship’s first mate was imprisoned for insubordination. Only nineteen years old and pregnant at the time, Patten brought the ship safely to its destination, earning international renown for her heroism under extraordinary circumstances. This portrait was made following that voyage."

102257,"Birthplace unknown    Cherokee leader Cunne Shote, determined to end hostilities with the British, traveled with two other chiefs to London in 1762. The British press described the Cherokee delegation as ""well made men, near six feet high, well dressed in their own country habit . . . [with painted faces and] heads adorned with shells, feathers, ear-rings and other ornaments."" Their exotic appearance and the political implications of their visit inspired the painted likeness on which this rare mezzotint is based. Imaginatively depicting Cunne Shote in his native land, the portrait testifies to the favorable outcome of the Cherokees’ diplomatic efforts. The chief’s prominent display of a silver gorget and medals from King George III proclaim Cherokee loyalty to the British Crown, an alliance that continued into the American Revolution."
102313,"Composer Jule Styne, often teamed with lyricist Sammy Cahn, published 1,500 songs and produced endless hits for Tin Pan Alley, Frank Sinatra, and Broadway. His notable shows included Bells Are Ringing (1957), Gypsy (1959), and Funny Girl (1962). Al Hirschfeld's drawing of Styne accompanied John Corry's 1977 Broadway column in the New York Times. At the time, Styne was performing his own songs at the Rainbow Grill. He admitted enjoying the ""ego trip"" of his two shows a night: ""You write a show and then you lose it,"" he explained.  ""It belongs to the guy conducting in the pit.""  Al Hirschfeld drew Styne's arms and hands with his trademark abbreviated line, but other passages, including the spiraling dots of the cigarette ash, the curl of stray hairs, and the elegantly complex hatching of the glasses and shirtfront, reveal the artist's remarkable versatility.  "
102478,"This portrait, taken from life and signed by the artist on May 4, 1989, was made when Ronald Reagan had been out of office a little more than three months. Nelson Shanks's image is that of an aging man, strikingly older than the adjacent photograph from Time's 1984 cover. Second terms for presidents have been notoriously hard, and Reagan's was marred by the Iran/Contra episode. On the other hand, he achieved a considerable triumph in his arms-control negotiations with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, culminating in the treaty signed in the 1987 Washington Summit that eliminated medium-range missiles in Europe and the Soviet Union. It was also during these years that the American economy came roaring back from the ""stagflation"" of the 1970s."
102499,"Born Newport, Rhode Island     Like his better-known son-the War of 1812's naval hero Stephen Decatur Jr.-Stephen Decatur Sr. played an important role in developing American maritime military strength. During the American Revolution he sailed both as a merchantman, bringing in vital supplies, and as a privateer, successfully taking many prize English vessels. In 1798, Decatur became an officer in the American navy, combating incursions by the French. Made after his retirement in 1801, this portrait by the popular émigré artist Charles Balthazar Julien Févret de Saint-Mémin clearly pleased Decatur. In addition to being  engraved, copies of the engraving were hand-painted on two pieces of Chinese export porcelain: a punch bowl commissioned as a gift for him and a covered jug. It is seen here with a pendant portrait of his wife, Ann Pine Decatur."
102501,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania    Ann Pine Decatur's portrait is a companion piece to that of her husband, Stephen Decatur Sr., whom she married in 1774. The popularity of French émigré artist Charles Balthazar Julien Févret de Saint-Mémin and his presence in Philadelphia made him a natural choice to portray the Decaturs. Four other members of the family had their pictures made by Saint-Mémin at this time, although the couple's famous son, Stephen Decatur Jr., was not among them. The portraits, which appear to be framed with their original verre églomisé, or gilded glass, represent the National Portrait Gallery's first pendant pair of Saint-Mémin drawings."
102502,"South Carolinian politician John C. Calhoun was known, along with Daniel Webster and Henry Clay, as one of the three great statesmen of American politics in the antebellum period. Rembrandt Peale cast him in a heroic guise in this imposing head. Peale achieved his dramatic effect by using the dark paper as a midtone, delineating the darker features of the head with black chalk, and building up the highlights with white. Drawn from life, the sketch-rendered with thin, precise lines of black, soft smudged stumping, and lively strokes of white-has an animating, lifelike quality missing in the final oil portrait for which it was a preliminary study. Peale, arguably the greatest portrait draftsman of his era in America, was an articulate advocate of art education and particularly emphasized drawing. His 1834 book on drawing went through four editions and nineteen printings."
102539,"Born Bisacquino, Sicily  Director Frank Capra gave Depression-era America an inspirational mythos through his film portrayals of the individual triumphing over hardship. He began his Hollywood career directing silent comedies; after he signed with Columbia Pictures in 1930, Capra directed such hits as the Academy Award–winning It Happened One Night (1934), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936)—for which he won a Best Director Oscar—and You Can’t Take It with You (1938), which won awards for both Best Picture and Best Director. During World War II, he produced the ""Why We Fight"" propaganda series for the army. After the war, he directed It’s a Wonderful Life (1946), the now-iconic holiday film starring Jimmy Stewart. Capra’s populist narratives established him as a master storyteller of twentieth-century American life."
102540,"Born Radersburg, Montana     In 1950 Myrna Loy played Lillian Moller Gilbreth in the movie version of the best-selling book Cheaper by the Dozen. She is best known, however, as the witty, sophisticated Nora Charles, who played opposite William Powell in The Thin Man film series of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1936, when Loy and Clark Gable were named the Queen and King of the Movies by a nationwide poll of moviegoers, Loy was considered to be the epitome of urbane glamour. She was one of Hollywood’s busiest and highest paid actresses until the outbreak of World War II, when she abandoned her career to work with the Red Cross. She returned to the screen in 1946 in The Best Years of Our Lives, which won the Best Picture Oscar. "
102543,"Called ""the blonde bombshell of opera,"" Maria Jeritza was one of the leading prima donnas at the Metropolitan Opera in the 1920s. Trained at the Volksoper, she won great favor in Vienna, where she inspired such composers as Richard Strauss to write for her. In 1921 the flamboyant soprano came to the Met, where she starred for twelve seasons and performed some twenty roles. Winning particular acclaim for her interpretations of Puccini's Tosca and Turandot during her Met tenure, Jeritza was also renowned for her performances in Carmen, Der Rosenkavalier, and for several Wagnerian roles, including Sieglinde.  Photographed by Steichen as she prepared for the title role in the Met's long-awaited revival of Carmen, Jeritza strikes a pose she would reprise during the opera's first act when, as an incredulous critic noted, ""she sang her entrance music while maintaining a cigarette in her teeth."""
102556,"Encouraged by the civil rights movement, labor organizer César Chávez began in the early 1960s to protest the unfair treatment of farm workers in California and the Southwest, the majority of whom were Mexican or Mexican American. In 1962 he and Dolores Huerta founded the forerunner of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW), which launched a boycott of California table grapes in 1965 as part of a movement to improve working conditions for field laborers. This eventually resulted in a national boycott of grapes by many sympathetic Americans.   This painting links modern-era activists Chávez and Huerta to historic figures Miguel Hidalgo and José María Morelos (leaders in Mexico’s War of Independence) and Emiliano Zapata (Mexican revolutionary and champion of agrarian reform), who shared their Mexican heritage and a commitment to justice. The painting’s title refers both to the mythical homeland of the Aztec people and to the cultural realm of greater Mexico."
102753,"In February 1925, Ambassador Frank B. Kellogg, about to leave London to take up his post as President Calvin Coolidge's secretary of state, asked Philip de Lászlo-the stylish depicter of the wealthy and powerful on both sides of the Atlantic-to paint his portrait. A farm boy with little formal legal education, Kellogg posed in the academic gown he wore when he received an honorary degree from Montreal's McGill University in 1913. Kellogg, who had served as special counsel to President Theodore Roosevelt's Department of Justice, was known in the press as the ""trust buster."" Later came greater fame as the recipient of the 1929 Nobel Peace Prize, awarded for his work in negotiating the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which ""renounced war as an instrument of national policy."" The pact was proclaimed on July 28, 1929, and was promptly broken when armed conflict broke out in Manchuria in 1931."
102754,"On June 16, 1886, ""shy"" Clara Cook married Frank B. Kellogg, the thirty-year-old attorney for Olmsted County, Minnesota. Frank Kellogg soon moved on to earn a fortune in private practice in St. Paul and later entered public life as a United States senator, ambassador to Great Britain, and secretary of state. His wife established a reputation as a popular hostess in Washington and London. ""She was a tactful, patient woman,"" noted Time magazine upon her death at the age of eighty, ""whose grace often counteracted her husband's impulsive conversation."" President Calvin Coolidge, Frank Kellogg reported, said he had made him ambassador ""as much because of Mrs. Kellogg as for himself.""    Clara Kellogg posed for Philip de Lászlo-famous as a society painter, especially of beautiful women-at London in April 1929 for a picture commissioned as a pendant to the artist's second portrait of her husband. "
102868,"Born Dorchester County, Maryland    Named Araminta Ross and born a slave, Harriet Tubman rebelled against her servitude from her earliest years, running away as early as age seven. At fifteen, she defied an overseer and was nearly killed when he gave her ""a stunning blow to the head."" Barely recovering, she regained her health, cultivated her toughness, and nurtured her anger. In 1844 she married a freedman, John Tubman, and in 1849 she escaped to Philadelphia, discarding her slave name for her mother's name, Harriet. After her husband refused to join her, Tubman became the lead conductor on the Underground Railroad, guiding escaping slaves to freedom. She made nineteen recorded trips out of the South and was reputed never to have lost a soul. Tubman was active throughout the abolitionist movement and conspired with John Brown about raiding the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, although she did not participate."
102869,"In politics, mention of the Great Depression evokes Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal; in painting, it summons up images of federally funded WPA murals depicting the nation's workforce. And in American letters, the work most synonymous with those hard times is The Grapes of Wrath, John Steinbeck's best-selling novel portraying the spirit-breaking poverty that overtook so much of the country's rural economy in the wake of prolonged drought and falling crop prices. When the book appeared in 1939, Steinbeck had already tasted popular success with his two novels Tortilla Flat and Of Mice and Men. Grapes of Wrath, however, earned him an acclaim that few American writers have enjoyed. No recent novel, one critic said at its publication, was ""better calculated to awaken the humanity of others."" In 1962, Steinbeck's literary accomplishments earned him the Nobel Prize for Literature. "
102874,"Martin Luther King Jr. shortly after his release from Reidsville Penitentiary, Georgia  One of the most frightening episodes in King’s early civil rights career occurred in October 1960, after he was arrested during a student-led protest at Rich’s department store in Atlanta. Refusing to post bail, King and the students vowed to remain in the Fulton County jail until all charges were dropped. While negotiations were under way to secure their release, a judge in neighboring DeKalb County ordered that King be held for violating probation for an earlier traffic citation. After a brief hearing, the judge revoked King’s probation and sentenced him to four months’ hard labor. Manacled and shackled, King was later transported to Georgia’s Reidsville Penitentiary. Fearing for his safety in the notoriously violent state prison, King’s supporters sought help from presidential candidate John F. Kennedy, who placed a reassuring call to Coretta King. But it was Robert Kennedy’s forceful call to the DeKalb judge that resulted in King’s release."
102875,"In this playful self-portrait, Carleton Watkins depicts himself as a miner working in a fashion favored by the early California argonauts. Watkins went west during the gold rush, eventually settling in San Francisco. Although he learned photography in a local portrait studio, Watkins made his reputation as a landscape photographer. In 1861 he ventured for the first time to Yosemite Valley, a place that his photographs would help make famous. During this period he also worked on commission for railroads, mining companies, and other industrial projects, creating images that publicized these ventures. Widely exhibited and often praised, his photographs shaped how people came to understand the West. Watkins was not a good businessman, however, and in 1874 he was forced to declare bankruptcy and sell his negatives to a rival photographer. Although he was able to reconstitute his practice, he often struggled to support himself during the latter half of his career."
102877,"Created in 1976 and jointly signed by Andy Warhol and Jimmy Carter, this portrait, commissioned by the Democratic National Committee, served as a fundraiser for the presidential campaign. Based on photographs Warhol took of Carter for thecover portrait of the New York Times Magazine two months before Carter's election in November 1976, the candidate appears solemn and pensive. Rectangular planes of juxtaposed colors intensify the tense expression. Carter would later explain that his ""frowning and scowling"" reflected financial stress and other concerns: ""I had lost some primaries; I didn't know where I was going to go next."" But if Warhol caught the future president at a difficult moment, the resulting image nonetheless resonated with its intended audience. Carter greatly appreciated the print, noting that Warhol and other artists helped ""turn the tide"" in his campaign with their fundraising efforts. "
103034,"On the day in 1857 that President James Buchanan appointed James Denver the governor of Kansas Territory, Kansas citizens voted to accept the Lecompton Constitution, which permitted slavery in the territory. A former captain under Winfield Scott during the Mexican War and a one-term congressman from California, Denver was immediately thrown into what became a protracted struggle over the question of slavery in the western territories. Violent skirmishes between settlers broke out throughout the region, and Denver-a staunch Unionist-was forced to acknowledge that all his powers would be required to ""prevent them from cutting each other's throats."" He was ultimately successful in squelching the turmoil, and in 1861 Kansas was admitted to the Union as a free state. In 1858, a gold-hunting party that Denver sent into western Kansas Territory named the town that would later become the capital of Colorado in his honor. "
103036,"Born New York City    David Baltimore is regarded as one of the world's most influential biologists. In 1975, at the age of thirty-seven, he won the Nobel Prize for his research on RNA viruses and their abilities to infect and permanently alter healthy cells. His research has aided the scientific understanding of retroviruses such as HIV and the molecular basis of the immune response. Baltimore is regularly consulted by the federal government and worldwide health organizations in the fight against and treatment of AIDS. Describing the joy of discovery, Baltimore explains: ""You go home, and you think about it when you go to sleep, and you think about it when you wake up . . . and you know there is something new in the world."" In this portrait by Jon Friedman, Baltimore appears with partial views of two photographs by the Cuban photographer Abelardo Morell, testifying to his long-standing interest in art."

103038,"Vera List had a lifelong passion for the arts, and with her husband, Albert A. List, she became an important collector of modern and contemporary art and a major philanthropist, championing social justice, music, and the visual arts. In 1996 President Clinton awarded List the National Medal of Arts. In this portrait, she appears lost in quiet meditation. ""It's only in expressing ideas that ideas give birth to other ideas or actually become ideas,"" List said of her desire to support cultural activities. ""One has thoughts, but until one expresses them, one really isn't thinking through at all, right? So that to just go about and see and collect-I mean that certainly is enriching to the person-but I think one has to get more involved. There has to be more of an exchange. At least, there has to be for me."""
103070,"Frank Chanfrau, one of the most popular actors of the mid-nineteenth century, capitalized on the emergence of vernacular characters in the American theater. Developing the role of Mose based on his experience as a volunteer fireman in the Bowery, Chanfrau starred in 1848 in a sketch, Glance at New York, which soon became a highly successful play, New York As It Is. Chanfrau was a sensation, inspiring more ""Mose"" plays. This watercolor-with its specific references to the Arch St. Theatre-was probably an advertisement for the actor's appearance in Philadelphia. The enormous success of Chanfrau's plays caused one observer to complain that ""the character of the audience was entirely changed, and Mose, instead of appearing on the stage, was in the pit, the boxes, and the gallery. It was all Mose, and the respectability of the house mosed too."" "
103129,"Born Portland, Oregon  In 1913 journalist John Reed attracted national attention with his sympathetic articles on the Mexican Revolution. Later, as a foreign correspondent, he was fired for his fierce denunciations of World War I, not easily publishable in the patriotic atmosphere that accompanied America’s entry into the war. In 1917 Reed traveled to Russia, met with Lenin, and joined the Soviet Bureau of Revolutionary Propaganda. On his return to America in April 1918 he wrote a dramatic, eyewitness account of the revolution, Ten Days That Shook the World, which made him a national celebrity. In 1919, Reed organized the U.S. Communist Labor Party, traveling to Moscow later that year to gain it recognition. Unable to return to the U.S. because of the post–World War I ""red scare,"" he died in Moscow and is buried in the Kremlin. Reed remains a hero for left-wing activists and was celebrated some sixty years after his death in Warren Beatty’s film Reds."
103177,"Born New York City  Clara Tice’s witty Dada portrait captures publisher and New York society leader Condé Nast at the height of his influence. The café society parties Nast hosted at his lavish Park Avenue penthouse were funded by a stable of successful magazines all meant to elevate standards of taste, including Vanity Fair, House and Garden, and his flagship journal, the fashion magazine Vogue. Tice’s clever portrait of Nast, based on a publicity photo, affectionately spoofs the dapper publisher’s aloof propriety by featuring undressed ladies of questionable taste. After an exhibition of Tice’s nudes attracted the fury of Anthony Comstock and his New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, Tice’s friends staged a mock trial, where she hoped to be acquitted of “having committed unspeakable black atrocities on white paper, abusing slender bodies of girls, cats, peacocks, and butterflies.”"
103178,"Born Birmingham, Alabama    Biologist Edward O. Wilson-two-time winner of the Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction-has been a leader of the biodiversity movement since the 1980s. Trained as an entomologist specializing in ant biology, Wilson has ranged from New Guinea and Sri Lanka to the Smithsonian Institution for his work. His groundbreaking Sociobiology: The New Synthesis (1975) was a controversial study that examined the biological basis of social behavior in all kinds of organisms, including vertebrates, with links to evolutionary biology. A hallmark of his later work has been an attempt to bridge the gap between science and the culture at large, as in Consilience: The Unity of Life (1998).    Artist Jennie Summerall posed Wilson in a setting reminiscent of the landscape on Lignum Vitae Key in Florida, which he helped preserve. Based on photographic images, the painting references Wilson's earlier studies on ant populations, while depicting him as he looks today."
103180,"Born Fort Worth, Texas    For both his musical virtuosity on alto saxophone and his compositions, Ornette Coleman is one of the major forces in American music in the late twentieth century. Like painter Jackson Pollock and writer Walt Whitman, who rejected traditional forms as too constrictive for human expression, Coleman broke with existing jazz diction, creating a raw sound that seemed to deliberately avoid the musical scale in favor of ""playing in the cracks."" In 1959, Coleman's quartet produced The Shape of Jazz to Come, a musical manifesto that was the aural equivalent of Pollock's abstract expressionism. Coleman disavowed the idea that ""free jazz,"" as his music was called, was pure improvisation, maintaining that careful planning went into each composition. In the 1970s Coleman moved into jazz funk, using electrified instruments. He is still a prolific musician, and his album Sound Grammar won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 2007."
103186,"Alfred Eisenstaedt's photograph brings together two generations of world-renowned physicists at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where J. Robert Oppenheimer accepted the position of director in 1947. Under Oppenheimer's leadership, the institute became a leading center for theoretical physics. Albert Einstein had been a scholar-in-residence at the institute since 1933, after fleeing Nazi Germany and renouncing his German citizenship. Einstein transformed the world of physics with his theory of relativity and work in quantum mechanics. On the basis of Einstein's recommendation, President Franklin D. Roosevelt convened a board to investigate the possibilities of using a nuclear chain reaction as an atom bomb. Oppenheimer directed the Manhattan Project, which developed and detonated the first atomic bomb in the desert outside of Alamogordo, New Mexico."
103187,"Born Polecat Creek, North Carolina    Later in his life, broadcast journalist Edward R. Murrow claimed to have had a ""front row seat for some of the greatest news events of history."" Hired by the Columbia Broadcasting System in 1935, Murrow made the first of more than 5,000 broadcasts in 1938 following Adolph Hitler's invasion of Austria. During World War II, Murrow became a household name for his descriptive radio reports and for his heartfelt closing, ""Good night and good luck."" Successfully transitioning to television after the war, he established a benchmark for excellence in television broadcasting with his program See It Now. Although his in-depth reporting on Senator Joseph McCarthy helped to undermine his anti-Communist activities of the 1950s, Murrow made enemies and lost sponsors, and in 1958 CBS cancelled the program. Alfred Eisenstaedt's portrait of Murrow-with his trademark cigarette-accompanied a 1959 profile of the famed journalist in Life magazine."
103188,"Although it was Rachel Carson's lyricism as a writer that made her books national best sellers, she was always proud of her work as a scientist. In 1936, when she accepted her first full-time job, as a marine biologist at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, she was one of only two female professionals at the agency. Alfred Eisenstaedt's 1962 portrait-created for a profile in Life magazine-shows Carson behind a microscope at her Silver Spring, Maryland, home. Earlier that year, Carson had published Silent Spring, an investigation into the harm of man-made pollutants that placed her at the center of a fiery battle between the chemical industry and a growing legion of environmental supporters. Carson's book caught the attention of President John Kennedy, who ordered a further investigation that confirmed her findings and helped pave the way for dramatic changes in the use of pesticides."
103201,"In the silent era, Dolores del Rio rode the wave of ""latin"" box office appeal that made Rudolph Valentino and Ramon Navarro major stars. Recognized as one of the most beautiful women on screen, she triumphed in 1926's biggest hit, What Price Glory, and then continued to flourish in the early years of talking pictures. She scored successes in Flying Down to Rio (the 1933 film that launched the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers duo), and Madame DuBarry (1934), but virtually stopped making pictures after marrying Cedric Gibbons, MGM's art director and the man who designed the Oscar statuette. She later reestablished her Hollywood career, starring with Elvis Presley in Flaming Star (1960) and appearing in John Ford's Cheyenne Autumn (1964). "
103208,"This photograph by Peter Hujar of John Ashbery shows the poet in 1975, the year in which he swept all the major literary awards with his book Self-Portrait in a Convex Mirror. The book’s title poem is a long mediation on the act of taking a likeness, and the fragile relationship between the individual and the work of art. He writes: ""What is beautiful seems so only in relation to a specific / Life, experienced or not, channeled into some form / Steeped in the nostalgia of a collective past."" This is Ashbery’s own artistic credo, as he has sought throughout his career to vocalize experience through his own ecstatic, long lines of verse. Ashbery, one of America’s most important poets and an heir to Walt Whitman, celebrated his eightieth birthday in 2007 by publishing his twenty-sixth book of poems."
103210,"Born Las Vegas, Nevada    The winner of eight Grand Slam singles championships, tennis star Andre Agassi enjoyed a memorable twenty-year professional career. Turning professional at age sixteen, he made national headlines as much for his rebellious ""Image is everything"" style as for his extraordinary athletic abilities. His first Grand Slam victory came in 1992 at Wimbledon-a tournament he initially chose not to play, citing his opposition to the event's traditionalism. During the 1990s, Agassi and his American rival Pete Sampras became the most-lauded players in their sport.  Martin Schoeller's portrait shows Agassi in 1998, when he was resurrecting his career after a series of injuries left him at number 141 in the world rankings. An intense fitness program helped him to win his second U.S. Open a year later and to regain the world number-one ranking."
103211,"The only child of a seventeen-year-old single mother, Lance Armstrong learned early to pour his abundance of energy and anger into bicycle racing. Shortly after being ranked the premier cyclist in the world in 1996, he was diagnosed with metastasized testicular cancer. One consequence of conventional treatment-probable lung damage-would have ended his competitive career, so he opted for a more drastic, but less damaging protocol. Its success was evident when he won the 1999 Tour de France, the first of a record-setting seven consecutive victories. His extraordinary achievement has led many critics to insist that he uses performance-enhancing drugs, a charge that has never been substantiated. The Lance Armstrong Foundation has raised millions for cancer patients, primarily through the sale of the ubiquitous yellow Livestrong bracelets. Armstrong retired from racing after the 2005 Tour de France."
103222,"Born Missoula, Montana    In movies such as Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, and Blue Velvet, David Lynch has established himself as one of the most original and controversial film directors of his generation. Known for probing the dark underside of small-town America or its jungle-like urban centers, he creates films whose visual appearance and narrative structure often depart from established conventions. Strange characters, eerie settings, and dreams-often nightmarish-figure prominently in much of his work. As a young man, Lynch trained to be an artist, but decided instead to pursue filmmaking. Inspired by the films of Stanley Kubrick and the paintings of Francis Bacon, he continues to explore the medium's creative possibilities in more recent films such as Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive. In 1999, British photographer Richard Ansett created this portrait of Lynch atop the Dorchester Hotel in London."
103231,"Born Fort Knox, Kentucky    The first African American woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for drama, Suzan-Lori Parks earned that distinction in 2002 for her play Topdog/Underdog. Critically acclaimed for writing multilayered, historically conscious, and provocative dramas, Parks notes that ""because so much of African American history has been unrecorded, dismembered, washed out, one of my tasks as playwright is to-through literature and real life-locate the ancestral burial ground, dig for bones, find bones, hear the bones sing, and write it down."" In works that can be lyrical and funny at the same time, Parks experiments with language and challenges her audiences on a variety of levels. ""Parks plays with plays and in doing so inspires others to do the same,"" observes fellow dramatist Tony Kushner. ""She has fun, productive fun, with her form's dual nature as literature and as 'script.'"""
103297,"Born Annapolis Royal, Nova Scotia    An ambitious British army officer, John Bradstreet was a conspicuous figure in the contest between the English and French for control of the North American continent. Participating in various military events, ranging from the capture of the French fortress at Louisbourg in 1745 to the campaign against the Ottawa chief Pontiac in 1764, Bradstreet distinguished himself particularly during the French and Indian War in the capture of Fort Frontenac along the St. Lawrence River. Falling out of favor after negotiating a soon-to-be repudiated peace treaty with several tribal nations, Colonel Bradstreet nonetheless achieved the rank of major general in 1772. He had hoped to succeed General Thomas Gage as commander-in-chief in America, but his health failed. Bradstreet's likeness (in its original carved gilt frame) is one of forty-six known portraits painted by Thomas McIlworth, a Scottish artist who arrived in America in 1757. "
103299,"This lithograph, which demonstrates Jasper Johns's grasp of the conceptual dimensions of Marcel Duchamp's work, derives from Johns's M.D. (1964), a profile silhouette of Duchamp composed of collaged paper and graphite. Johns transferred M.D. to a canvas placed at the lower left of his 1964 assemblage According to What. In this lithograph, Johns documents the sometimes-hidden presence of Duchamp's profile in that larger piece. It also points to the technique Johns used to create the silhouette in M.D. by depicting the string from which he suspended Duchamp's profile. Significantly, the hinged canvas in this lithograph is both closed and open, signifying Duchamp's presence and non-presence in According to What. Of the crossed-out signature in the lower right, Johns notes, ""I have deliberately taken Duchamp's own work and slightly changed it, and thought to make a kind of play on whose work it is, whether mine or his."""
103309,"Born Louisville, Kentucky    Throughout their long collaboration, Ralph Steadman drew journalist Hunter S. Thompson many times. The duo was first assigned to cover the Kentucky Derby in 1970 and continued to work together over the years, with Steadman illustrating Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and several articles for Rolling Stone magazine. In this print, created about a year after Thompson's death-titled Up, Up and Up Yours-Steadman pays tribute to his longtime friend. Thompson is depicted as a peacock, sporting his trademark hat, sunglasses, sneakers, and cigarette holder. Versions of this image were seen in the 1978 BBC program Fear and Loathing in Gonzovision and in the 2005 print Gonzo Memorial. Here, Steadman refines the image, accenting Thompson's sneakers with red detailing. The final touch is the profane gesture of the middle finger, evoking Thompson's flamboyant and irreverent personality."
103311,"Born New York City     Hailed as “a new American masterpiece,” Tony Kushner’s epic play Angels in America (subtitled A Gay Fantasia on National Themes) won the Pulitzer Prize in 1993. Comprising two dramas—Millennium Approaches and Perestroika—that deal with the themes of homosexuality and AIDS, this searing play was both a call for compassion and an indictment of the Reagan administration for largely ignoring the mounting AIDS crisis in the 1980s. Through this emotionally powerful work, Kushner drove home to audiences the devastating impact of AIDS in very human terms. As the New York Times observed, Angels in America is “nothing less than a fierce call for gay Americans to seize the strings of power in the war for tolerance and against AIDS.” Opening on Broadway in 1992, part one of the drama was nominated for nine Tony Awards and ultimately won four, including that for best play."
103313,"Born London, England     Boston Corbett is the man who shot and killed John Wilkes Booth. He  joined the Union army at the outbreak of the Civil War and reenlisted three times, eventually becoming a sergeant in the Sixteenth New York Cavalry. On April 24, 1865, Corbett and twenty-five other men from the Sixteenth were selected to pursue Lincoln’s assassin. Two days later they cornered Booth in a tobacco barn on Richard Garrett’s Virginia farm. The barn was set on fire, and Booth’s co-conspirator, David Herold, surrendered while Booth remained inside. Despite orders to take him alive, Corbett shot Booth through a crack in the side of the barn, puncturing his spinal cord. Dragged from the barn, Booth died a few hours later. Corbett received his share of the $100,000 reward money, amounting to $1,653.85. "
103335,"Born Duncan, Arizona     In 1981, President Ronald Reagan fulfilled a campaign promise to appoint the first woman to the U.S. Supreme Court by nominating Arizona lawyer and judge Sandra Day O'Connor to a seat on the bench. After announcing the nomination, Reagan wrote in his diary, ""Already the flak is starting and from my own supporters. . . . I think that she'll make a good justice."" O'Connor served from 1981 to her retirement in 2006 and left a reputation as a conscientious associate justice, one inclined toward narrowly based judgments rendered on a case-by-case basis, thereby avoiding setting sweeping precedents. A lifelong Republican, O'Connor came to the court after a career in the law and politics in both Arizona and California    This portrait, along with twenty-four others by an equal number of artists, was created on October 10, 2006, when O'Connor agreed to be the model for a longstanding informal painting group that meets weekly in New York City. "
103345,"Copper Self-Portrait with Dog  Susan Hauptman  born 1947    Like so many of Susan Hauptman's self-portrayals, Copper Self-Portrait with Dog appears purposefully disjointed. The hyperrealism of the dog and Hauptman's mid-twentieth-century skirt and hat contrast bizarrely with the folk-naive rendering of the feet and the mismatched proportions. Juxtaposing the ultra-feminine ruffles and flowers with a masculine, nearly hairless head creates a disturbing disparity. The whimsical costume, with its canine ""accessory,"" appears comical at first glance, but the confrontational pose and serious expression deny laughter. Even Hauptman's beautiful, meticulous technique stands in stark contrast to rougher, seemingly unfinished portions of the drawing. Hauptman questions gender stereotypes and draws upon self-portrait traditions of dressing up and masquerading, but she does not do so to impersonate others or to reinvent the self. The constant pairing and contrasting seems instead to be an exploration of dualities within herself that coexist with creative tension."
103399,"After brief service in the American diplomatic corps, William Carmichael represented Maryland in the Continental Congress for two years. In 1779 he accompanied John Jay to Spain as secretary of the legation. When he left Philadelphia, he took with him Charles Willson Peale's recently completed portrait, George Washington at the Battle of Princeton, which he successfully sold in Spain at the behest of the artist. When Jay left for Paris in 1782, Carmichael remained behind in Madrid as the chargé d'affaires. Never having been granted the title of minister and with his pay in arrears, Carmichael resigned his post in 1794. He died the following year in Madrid.    Después de servir brevemente en el cuerpo diplomático norteamericano, por dos años William Carmichael representó a Maryland en el Congreso Continental.  En 1779 acompañó a John Jay a España como secretario de la legación.  Cuando se fue de Filadelfia, llevó consigo el retrato recién terminado por Charles Willson Peale, George Washington at the Battle of Princeton, que a instancias del artista logró vender en España. Cuando Jay partió hacia París en 1782, Carmichael se quedó atrás en Madrid como encargado de negocios.  Puesto que nunca recibió el título de ministro y el pago de su sueldo estaba atrasado, Carmichael se retiró de su cargo en 1794.  Falleció al año siguiente en Madrid. "
103405,"Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, a leading political and military figure in South Carolina, was sought out by John Trumbull in 1791. Trumbull, who was traveling along the East Coast taking ""heads"" of those who had played a part in events of the American Revolution, had in mind-although he never carried it out-the 1779 siege of Savannah as the topic for one of his historical pieces. Pinckney had been in the thick of the disastrous assault, but had the satisfaction of seeing his well-disciplined regiment hold steady under fire. This portrait remained in his brother's family until presented to the National Portrait Gallery.  "
103406,"Thomas Pinckney, the former governor of South Carolina, was about to become minister to England when John Trumbull made his portrait for use in a contemplated history painting. Prominent during the American Revolution, Major Pinckney was-along with his older brother Charles-a participant in the ill-fated attempt to recapture Savannah from the British. More significant was his later role as special envoy to Spain, where in 1795 he negotiated a popular treaty benefiting American commerce on the Mississippi River. This portrait remained with descendants until given to the National Portrait Gallery.  "
103655,"Born Queens, New York  In the early 1980s, while at Adelphi University on Long Island, Chuck D (Carlton D. Ridenhour) created a tape for the student radio station where he worked (WBAU) to fend off a fellow local MC. The tape was titled Public Enemy #1. Chuck D’s interest in politics and activism formed the basis for the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Joined by fellow student William Drayton (Flavor Flav), they ushered in a new sound to hip-hop. With layered, noisy street sounds and Chuck D’s booming voice and anti-establishment message juxtaposed against Flavor Fav’s comic relief, Public Enemy changed the face of hip-hop. Chuck D remains a constant voice today, writing a song about Hurricane Katrina and appearing before Congress regarding music file sharing.  Since 2000 David Scheinbaum has photographed more than a hundred hip-hop performers, both in concert and backstage."
103663,"Born Brooklyn, New York  Dante Terrell Smith, taking the stage name Mos Def, has achieved success as both an actor and a musician. With the 1996 release of ""Universal Magnetic,"" he became an underground favorite in the hip-hop world. He solidified his standing when he collaborated with Talib Kweli, releasing the album Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star in 1998. From 2005 to 2011, he was nominated for six Grammys. His acting career is equally successful: he has appeared on Broadway in the Tony-nominated, Pulitzer Prize–winning Topdog/Underdog, has had recurring roles in television, and has appeared in several movies. He was nominated for an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his portrayal of Vivien Thomas in HBO’s Something the Lord Made. In 2011 he took the new stage name of Yasiin.  Since 2000 David Scheinbaum has photographed more than one hundred hip-hop performers, both in concert and backstage."
103666,"Born Brooklyn, New York    Hip hop star Kris Parker-known popularly as ""KRS-One,"" for ""Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone""-is both a critically acclaimed emcee and a respected activist working to further nonviolent conflict resolution. Since 1987, he has released nineteen albums. His music has evolved stylistically over time and shows the influence of many sources, including reggae and gospel. Yet what has remained consistent has been his commitment for using hip hop to teach and to empower others. In 1988 he helped develop the ""Stop the Violence"" campaign to address the crisis of violence in America. Although his statements have sometimes precipitated controversy, his thought-provoking lyrics and his message about social responsibility continue to resonate. As a testament to his work, he received a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 2008 BET Awards. David Scheinbaum's portrait pictures Parker during a performance in 2002."
103668,"Born Dallas, Texas  Erykah Badu’s debut album, Baduizm, was released in 1997 and almost overnight established her as one of the leading and most original female voices in R&B. Often compared to the legendary Billie Holiday, Badu (born Erica Wright) has incorporated a variety of musical styles to create a unique, richly textured sound. She has also collaborated in recent years with a number of different groups, including The Roots and Burning Spear.  David Scheinbaum’s portrait of Badu shows her in performance in 2003, the year in which she released her fourth album, Worldwide Underground, and won a Grammy Award for the best R&B song, “Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip Hop).” "
103740,"Born Bridgeport, Connecticut    As an activist, Larry Kramer has been alternately lionized and loathed for his full-volume, uncompromising positions on issues related to the gay rights movement. For almost forty years, Kramer has mixed advocacy with art. He has written many acclaimed, though often controversial, plays, novels, and nonfiction essays about gays and lesbians in American society. His 1985 play The Normal Heart-which examined the cultural consequences of the AIDS crisis-was especially powerful. In 1982 Kramer helped to found the Gay Men's Health Crisis, and in 1987 he created the organization ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power), whose tactics of direct confrontation and civil disobedience owed much to the pivotal Stonewall Riots of 1969. Robert Giard's likeness of Kramer is part of a large collection of portraits of prominent gay and lesbian writers that the photographer created partially in response to seeing The Normal Heart.  "
103823,"Born Rosebud Indian Reservation, South Dakota    Regarded by many as the spiritual leader of the American Indian Movement (AIM), Leonard Crow Dog played an influential role, beginning in the 1960s, in the effort to secure greater rights for Native peoples. A member of the Oglala Lakota, Crow Dog participated in numerous rallies and demonstrations across the country, and was often jailed in the process. He was also responsible for redirecting AIM's emphasis, speaking out not only for justice and tribal sovereignty, but also for the revitalization of traditional rituals and ceremonies that had waned in the recent past. His priorities shaped the Native American Self-Determination and Education Act, a landmark bill signed in 1975 that swung the pendulum away from acculturation and toward greater respect for cultural traditions. Crow Dog continues to write and give speeches and remains a conspicuous leader in the larger Native American community."
103834,"Polish was the keynote of a jazz concert by the Stan Getz Quartet and Count Basie's orchestra, a New York Times reviewer wrote on November 28, 1963, noticing that Getz imbued even the gentlest phrases with ""a sinew and mettle that keep them alive and vigorous."" Seymour Chwast's innovative poster, echoing the vitality and assurance of the renowned jazz musicians, advertised the concert with cartoonish figures, green skin tones, and a blue horn. Chwast, along with Milton Glaser and other graphic artists, founded Push Pin Studios in 1954. Despite different styles, they all sought an integration of illustration, design, and typography, and were attracted, as Glaser noted, to things ""orthodox modernism"" despised, including ornamentation and hand-drawn pictures. Going against the grain of photographic magazine illustration and minimalist abbreviation in corporate advertising, Push Pin Studios introduced a fresh and influential approach to poster art and graphic design. "
103846,"She's 5'1 . . . absolutely dizzy, and rarer than a homemade honeybun"" raved an awed reporter in 1972 about the singer-comedienne Bette Midler, then performing at New York City's Continental Baths. ""Her hair is ""red as a Pomegranate. . . . Her bosom is formidable. . . . She moves fiercely on tiny feet strapped into the highest platform wedgies since Carmen Miranda."" Richard Amsel, an emerging talent who had recently won a nationwide contest to design the poster for Hello, Dolly!, caught her energy and flair in his 1973 poster. Midler's accompanist, Barry Manilow, who produced her first and second albums, admired Amsel's work, and Midler agreed he should design the cover and advertising art. His stylized strutting figure graced Midler's second album, promoted a national tour, and here announced her appearance to sold-out audiences at New York's Palace Theater in December 1973. A similar image was reused for later albums and tours. "
103923,"Warhol Filming Duchamp, Deluxe Box represents Nat Finkelstein's response to Andy Warhol's February 1966 screen test of Marcel Duchamp, which he photographed in progress. Warhol Filming Duchamp pays homage to Duchamp's Green Box-a series of notes that accompanied his Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors, Even (The Large Glass). Finkelstein, in collaboration with Eric Schneyderman, created his own box, including his photographs, furled contact sheets, and the issue of the journal Étant Donné Marcel Duchamp in which Finkelstein's account of the evening appears. Also present is an altered photograph of Warhol à la Mona Lisa, a reference to Duchamp's famous L.H.O.O.Q. Finkelstein's poem ""weird wedding,"" attributed to Rrose Sélavy, playfully alludes to the artistic ""union"" between Warhol and Duchamp, in a parody of the narrative of frustrated desire developed in The Large Glass.  "
103952,"In this composite image, Ray Beldner used digital technology to bring together twenty-six well-known images of Marcel Duchamp. By compiling images from throughout Duchamp's life, Beldner effectively collapses time and merges Duchamp's various identities into one compositional space. As Beldner notes: ""It's a subtle photo, but if given enough time to reflect on it, one can discern many likenesses-from Rrose Sélavy to the artist at rest in front of his chessboard."" The title references Duchamp's readymades-the everyday objects, such as a bottle rack and a urinal, that he designated as works of art. The commonly used French phrase ""tout fait"" roughly translates to ""ready made."" By pairing the artist's name with this phrase, or with Beldner's construction of him, Duchamp himself becomes the ""readymade"" for this work of art. "
103966,"Carlos Santana is a guitarist and songwriter who infused rock and roll with Latin rhythms, spiritual visions, jazz improvisation, and African musical practices. Born and raised in Mexico, Santana was integral to the 1960s San Francisco music scene and a leading force of the multiethnic countercultural imagination: he gave historic performances at the Fillmore West and Woodstock while his albums went platinum. Santana’s slow, piercing guitar solos combine blues feeling with jazz phrasing, and they set off the band’s pan–Latin American rhythmic foundation as drawn from boogaloo, salsa, funk, Cuban rhythms, and the early rock and roll of Ritchie Valens. His quest for spiritual music practices led him deeper into jazz (via John Coltrane and Miles Davis), then into Indian ragas (via John McLaughlin), and then to African music. His 1999 song ""Smooth"" was an apt global hit at the turn of the millennium."
103969,"Janis Joplin’s (1943–1970) first years out of high school were characterized by aimless drift. But somewhere along the line she began singing in coffeehouses, and in 1966 she accepted an invitation to be the lead vocalist for the San Francisco rock band Big Brother and the Holding Company. Patrons of local nightclubs loved her shrill, rasping style, and in 1967 she took the country by storm with her rendition of ""Love Is Like a Ball and Chain"" at the Monterey International Pop Festival. Joplin performed with an electrifying ferocity and consumed large quantities of whiskey, both on and off the stage. That combination led many to think that she would soon burn out, but she shrugged, ""When I can’t sing, I’ll worry about it then."" That was something she never had to confront. In late 1970, Joplin died at age twenty-seven from a drug overdose."
103975,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Janet Gaynor was just twenty-two when she became the first person to win an Academy Award for Best Actress. Honored for her memorable performances in three dramatic films—Sunrise (1927), Seventh Heaven (1927), and Street Angel (1928)—Gaynor was the only actress ever to earn the Oscar for multiple roles rather than for work in a single film. One of the few stars to make the successful transition from silent films to ""talkies,"" Gaynor made her talking picture debut in 1929 in Sunny Side Up and maintained her standing as a major Hollywood star throughout the 1930s. Her Oscar-nominated performance in the 1937 version of A Star Is Born was the high point of her movie career, and she was still at the top of her profession when she retired two years later, after marrying MGM’s director of costume design, Gilbert Adrian."
103983,"When organizers of the Black Panther Party set up this scene for a photographer in 1967-enthroning the young ""minister of defence"" Huey Newton in a wicker chair and surrounding him with a spear, a gun, an animal pelt, and African shields-they hoped to produce a visual emblem of the movement for the second issue of their newspaper. But the photograph became a more potent and far-reaching symbol of radical protest than anyone could have guessed. It was published in the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times and elsewhere. When Newton was wounded and arrested during a traffic-stop altercation and subsequently convicted of killing the policeman, supporters rallied to get him out of jail. The ""Free Huey"" movement, adopted by many on the radical left, got international exposure. Protestors carried this photographic poster during massive rallies and displayed it as a symbol of leftist political sympathies.  "
103985,"As an artist and collector, David Driskell has had a major role in the study and exhibition of African American art. He was for many years on the faculty of the Department of Art at the University of Maryland, where he was awarded the title of Distinguished University Professor. Driskell has curated several major exhibitions, including ""Hidden Heritage: Afro-American Art, 1800-1950"" (1985) and ""Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America"" (1987). Driskell has lectured widely and has made seven films for television, including Hidden Heritage: The Roots of African American Painting, commissioned by CBS.   Clarice Smith attended the University of Maryland before finishing her BA and MFA at George Washington University. She has known Driskell for many years and was commissioned to paint his portrait in conjunction with the 150th anniversary of the University of Maryland and to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the university's David C. Driskell Center."
103986,"When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real, the Skin Horse told the Rabbit. So wrote Margery Williams in her children's classic, The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Became Real, which was first published in 1922.   Williams, the author of many children's books, resided from the age of nine to nineteen in the United States and attended the Convent School in Sharon Hills, Pennsylvania. After her marriage to the Italian bookseller Francisco Bianco, she lived in France, England, and Italy before settling permanently in New York City in 1921. This portrait was painted by the Biancos' close friend James Bolivar Manson, a member of the Camden Town Group, which was composed of sixteen English artists who aspired to emulate European modernism. "
103988,"E. & H. T. Anthony & Co. was nineteenth-century America's largest manufacturer and distributor of photographic supplies. Founded in the 1840s by daguerreotypist Edward Anthony, and later operated in partnership with his brother Henry T. Anthony, the firm marketed a vast array of apparatus and materials to the burgeoning photography industry. Not surprisingly, Anthony's provided mountings for photographic jewelry and listed numerous lockets, brooches, and rings in its 1854 sales catalogue."
103990,"George N. Barnard was one of Mathew Brady’s photographers who, like Alexander Gardner, would split from his employer to further his own career. Barnard had opened a daguerreotype studio in Oswego, New York, in 1846 and was a pioneer in the field of documentary photography, capturing dramatic views of a huge mill fire in 1853. He later worked for other photographers, including Brady, who hired him in the late 1850s. While Brady and Gardner concentrated on the eastern theaters, Barnard went south and west, following William T. Sherman’s army—most noticeably on its famous “March to the Sea” in 1864. Barnard traveled back to the South after the war, documenting the cost of war in his 1866 publication Photographic Views of Sherman’s Campaign."
103993,"This photograph shows landscape photographer Henry Hamilton Bennett seated with his three children. Before Bennett, few Americans had ever heard about-much less seen-the Wisconsin Dells, a section of the Wisconsin River characterized by eye-catching sandstone cliffs and wooded glens. Opening a photography studio in nearby Kilbourn City in 1865, Bennett hoped to specialize in portraiture. However, when the studio failed to attract enough clients, he decided to pursue landscape photography instead. His images captured the Dells' unique beauty and helped to transform this once-remote place into one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Midwest. In addition to running a successful studio, Bennett was forever experimenting with his equipment. He built a remarkable large-format panoramic camera, created some of the earliest instantaneous photographs, and devised a new system for flash photography."
103995,"Known for his visually poetic views of the often forbidding western landscape, Albert Bierstadt was one of the first academically trained painters to travel in the West. Having first gone west with a surveying expedition in 1859, Bierstadt returned to his New York studio and began painting panoramic landscapes that won him wide acclaim. His paintings rendered the West as a largely uninhabited landscape infused with a spirituality that enraptured viewers. This carte-de-visite photograph of the artist is dated from around the period when Bierstadt returned to northern California in 1871. On that visit he found that the once pristine and open wilderness he had depicted a decade earlier had been discovered by tourists and affected by rapid industrialization. Undiscouraged, Bierstadt traveled to more remote locations in the Sierra Nevada range and continued to paint. "
104002,"During periodic visits to the front, Mathew Brady directed the operations of the Civil War cameramen whose photographs would later carry the Brady credit line. On several occasions, Brady chose to portray himself in the company of leading Union army officers. In these stereographs issued by E. & H. T. Anthony & Co. from negatives by Brady & Co., the famed photographer is pictured with General Ambrose Burnside at the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac, near Richmond, and with General Samuel Heintzelmen and his staff at Arlington House, Virginia."

104005,"Mathew Brady and his camera crew in the field  The name of Mathew Brady is synonymous with Civil War photography. His oeuvre alone made the war the nation’s first epic event to be recorded visually on a grand scale. Brady had studios in New York City and Washington, D.C., where he burnished his reputation for making celebrity portraiture. Yet it was his work in the battlefields—at Antietam, Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Petersburg, and Richmond—that was revelatory at the time and is still so transfixing today. Photographic technology could not yet record motion or live action, but Brady’s after-battle scenes are as close as we can get to visually experiencing the Civil War.                  This photograph shows Brady, standing second from the right, in camp with his camera crew in Berlin (now Brunswick), Maryland."
104038,"Gardner’s gallery and colleagues     The nation’s capital was a center for photography during the war, and Alexander Gardner set up his new studio in May 1863 at Seventh and D Streets, just a few blocks from that of his former employer, Mathew Brady. Gardner split with Brady after the success of his Antietam photographs. The signage gives a full range of Gardner’s services, showing how he catered to the market for photographic images; the main sign reads “News of the War.”              Not as flamboyantly costumed as in his first self-portrait, this image of Alexander Gardner shows him as a workingman, which was his family’s heritage back in Scotland. Gardner’s proficiency as a photographer was based in part on his manual dexterity; he was a master at coating the glass-plate negatives with collodion, which formed the plate’s light-sensitive emulsion. By the beginnings of 1863 James Gardner was working with his brother in Washington.              Timothy O’Sullivan (1840–1882) and his brother-in-law, William Pywell (1843–1886), also got their start with Brady. O’Sullivan teamed up with Gardner both at Antietam and Gettysburg and later had a successful career on his own. After the war, Pywell traveled west with Gardner to photograph the plains and the Native Americans living there."
104039,"This photograph was taken following the dedication of the Bull Run battle monument on June 11, 1865. Alexander Gardner is at the far left, and his brother James is lying on the grass to the right (with the hat). Other people in the picture are New York Herald reporters S. M. Carpenter (lifedates unknown), seated second from the left in profile, and L. A. Whiteley (1825–1869), standing ninth from the left. The photograph is attributed to William Morris Smith, an employee of Gardner’s."
104047,"Within months of the public announcement in 1839 detailing the daguerreotype process, Jeremiah Gurney had acquired a rudimentary camera and was experimenting with this first practical method of photography. A jeweler by profession, he gave up the trade in favor of daguerreotypy, and in 1840 he established a studio in New York City. Over the next decade, Gurney emerged as one the city's leading daguerreian artists, despite vigorous competition from such rivals as Mathew Brady. In 1853 Gurney won the first major American prize for daguerreotypes in a contest sponsored by Edward Anthony, owner of the nation's largest photographic supply company. Gurney also embraced the medium of paper-print photography, becoming a pioneer in producing large-format prints such as this self-portrait. Although his surviving advertisements do not mention photographic jewelry, an article published in 1858 described Gurney's photographs as being ""of all sizes, from the 'locket miniature' to the 'life.'""    "
104050,"A self-taught artist, Josiah Hawes earned his living as an itinerant painter of portrait miniatures and other works before abandoning painting in favor of daguerreotypy in 1841. Two years later he joined A. Southworth & Co., the Boston daguerreian studio that would soon be known as Southworth & Hawes. Hawes shared the camera duties with Albert Southworth, but when his colleague took leave in 1849 to mine for gold in California, Hawes kept their studio running and maintained the high quality that patrons had come to expect. Southworth returned to Boston in 1851, and the two men continued to work together until they dissolved their partnership in 1862. Hawes spent the remainder of his life in photography, working in the same studio that he and Southworth had shared. He was in his eighties when he posed for this portrait with his wife, Nancy, and their children.  "
104051,"This self-portrait of Frank Jay Haynes shows the photographer at Norris Geyser Basin during the first American expedition into Yellowstone National Park during the winter. With ice on his beard, Haynes holds a notebook in front of him and looks into the cold wilderness. Haynes was the official photographer for both the Northern Pacific Railroad and Yellowstone National Park. Over the course of forty years, Haynes documented the development of the park and also offered photographic services to visitors. While Haynes captured the drama of the park's natural features by emphasizing its unique geological formations and grand vistas, his photographs also transformed the landscape into a tourist destination. Later, from a specially outfitted railroad car, he sold views of Yellowstone and created portraits of individuals in communities along the Northern Pacific's lines. "
104053,"The photographic equipment that John K. Hillers used during John Wesley Powell's western surveys included cameras, a portable darkroom, and glass-plate negatives that together weighed more than a thousand pounds. This photograph shows Hillers inspecting a photographic plate in Utah while surrounded by such equipment. A German immigrant who was a Union sergeant during the Civil War, Hillers joined Powell's survey in 1871 when Powell needed a boatman for his expedition down the Colorado River. Hillers was hired at first as a laborer, but when he expressed an interest in photography, the survey's official photographer taught him the wet-plate process. Hillers continued to work for Powell when he became head of the Bureau of Ethnology in 1879 and devoted six years to documenting Native American communities in the Southwest. Like other photographers associated with western expeditions, Hillers made important contributions to the scientific understanding of the lands and Native peoples of the West. "
104055,"This photograph shows William Henry Jackson squatting next to his photographic equipment on a rock outcropping in Wyoming's Teton Range. His assistant, Charley Campbell, stands beside him. At the time, Jackson was traveling with and creating views for Ferdinand V. Hayden's survey expedition into the territory surrounding Yellowstone. He had participated in the first comprehensive survey of Yellowstone the previous summer, and his photographs from that trip played a role in Congress's decision to designate it a national park in the spring of 1872. Over a lengthy career, Jackson traveled extensively throughout the West, creating photographs for scientific reports, railroad companies, and later the burgeoning tourist trade. Having spent time with painters Sanford Gifford and Thomas Moran, he was well versed in the tradition of landscape art, and his photographs often conveyed a similar wonderment regarding the majestic beauty of the western landscape."
104056,"This photograph depicts three men (the one on the left is possibly photographer William Henry Jackson) standing on the edge of a rock outcropping with Shoshone Falls in the background. Two cameras rest on the ground before them. On the left is a large-format view camera similar to the one displayed in this exhibition. The other is a two-lens stereograph camera. Apart from Native Americans, few had ever encountered Shoshone Falls prior to the 1860s. Word of its size and natural beauty inspired legions of scientists and artists alike to venture into the remote Idaho frontier to see and study it. Many brought cameras to document the site and to mark their own presence at this wondrous landmark. Described by an early French traveler as comparable to ""an exploding bottle of champagne,"" Shoshone Falls represented another example of the West's extraordinary beauty. "
104057,"Wearing an antique dress, photographer Gertrude Käsebier pictures herself in this self-portrait as a traditional matron. In the world of fine art photography, however, Käsebier was hardly a conservative figure. One of the founding members of the Photo-Secession and the first photographer to be profiled in Alfred Stieglitz's Camera Work, she earned a reputation at the turn of the twentieth century for reimagining the creative possibilities of portrait photography. Käsebier trained to be a painter at Brooklyn's Pratt Institute, but decided to pursue photography instead. Although she was married, with three children, she opened a professional studio in Manhattan, where she soon attracted many of the leading artistic and literary celebrities of the day. Refusing to use the painted backdrops and contrived poses used by many portrait photographers, Käsebier adapted lessons drawn from her study of modern art to craft portraits that were rich in character and psychological insight."
104068,"Eadweard Muybridge is seated in this self-portrait at the base of the famous ""General Grant"" sequoia tree. Having obtained a mammoth-plate camera in 1872, Muybridge spent the summer creating a series of photographs of Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove that might rival those by Carleton Watkins. Like his photographic colleague, Muybridge immigrated to California during the gold rush. There, he took up photography as a profession and earned a reputation for his panoramic cityscapes and for his views of the California landscape. In 1872, railroad magnate Leland Stanford approached Muybridge for help in settling a $25,000 wager about whether a trotting horse ever had all four hooves off the ground. The challenge of photographing a horse in motion fascinated Muybridge and inspired him to conduct further experiments photographing individuals and animals in motion. These studies-and the different machines he devised-are recognized as forerunners of modern motion picture technology. "
104070,"Gardner’s gallery and colleagues     The nation’s capital was a center for photography during the war, and Alexander Gardner set up his new studio in May 1863 at Seventh and D Streets, just a few blocks from that of his former employer, Mathew Brady. Gardner split with Brady after the success of his Antietam photographs. The signage gives a full range of Gardner’s services, showing how he catered to the market for photographic images; the main sign reads “News of the War.”              Not as flamboyantly costumed as in his first self-portrait, this image of Alexander Gardner shows him as a workingman, which was his family’s heritage back in Scotland. Gardner’s proficiency as a photographer was based in part on his manual dexterity; he was a master at coating the glass-plate negatives with collodion, which formed the plate’s light-sensitive emulsion. By the beginnings of 1863 James Gardner was working with his brother in Washington.              Timothy O’Sullivan (1840–1882) and his brother-in-law, William Pywell (1843–1886), also got their start with Brady. O’Sullivan teamed up with Gardner both at Antietam and Gettysburg and later had a successful career on his own. After the war, Pywell traveled west with Gardner to photograph the plains and the Native Americans living there."
104071,"Celebrated for his candid photographs of the western landscape, Timothy O'Sullivan began his career as an assistant to Alexander Gardner in Mathew Brady's Washington, D.C., studio. During the Civil War, O'Sullivan traveled with the Union army throughout the mid-Atlantic states, creating memorable photographs of the death and destruction visited upon the region. In 1867 he traveled West for the first time under the auspices of Clarence King's Fortieth Parallel Survey. Although he made Washington, D.C., home, O'Sullivan spent a part of each of the next seven years working in the West for King and later George Wheeler's Hundredth Meridian Survey. Like most landscape photographers of this period, O'Sullivan created many compositions that glorified the natural beauty of the land. Yet more often he represented the western landscape as a desolate, arid terrain that seemed incapable of supporting settlement. O'Sullivan died of tuberculosis at age forty-two. "
104086,"One of the pioneers of American portrait photography, Albert Sands Southworth (standing, right) joined with Josiah Johnson Hawes to create daguerreotypes unrivaled for their artistry and their technical achievement. Southworth made his first daguerreian experiments in collaboration with his friend Joseph Pennell, and in 1841 they established a studio in Boston. After Pennell's departure in 1843, Southworth brought Josiah Hawes into the enterprise, and their creative partnership began. Committed to attaining ""the highest perfection possible"" in their work, the duo excelled in creating beautifully composed and expressive daguerreotype portraits, particularly in the large (8 ½ x 6 ½-inch) and technically demanding whole-plate format. Southworth & Hawes also produced works in a variety of other sizes, including vignetted miniature images that were intended for use in photographic jewelry. Southworth & Hawes may not have advertised such jewelry, but there is evidence to indicate that it was part of their studio's output.    "
104105,"Born London, England    Armed with a pencil and a sketchbook, artist-correspondent Alfred Waud created an incomparable record of the Civil War with his illustrations for two of the nation's leading news weeklies. Working first for the New York Illustrated News (1860-61) and then for Harper's Weekly , Waud accompanied the Army of the Potomac on all its major campaigns, from its defeat at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861 to its victory at the siege of Petersburg in 1865. At a time when technical limitations made combat photography impractical, Waud produced highly detailed sketches that captured all the fury and chaos of the battlefield. When translated to the printed page in the form of wood engravings, Waud's renderings gave readers an eyewitness view of the war as it unfolded."
104107,"An innovator during photography's formative years, John A. Whipple (standing, left of center tent pole) made the first daguerreotype to capture the moon's surface in sharp detail (1851) and later joined the Harvard Astronomical Expedition to photograph a rare solar eclipse (1869). Whipple maintained a studio in Boston for several decades and, while in partnership with photographer James Wallace Black, advertised daguerreotypes in ""every variety of style,"" including those suitable for inclusion in ""Gold medallions [and] Lockets.""    "
104114,"Customers entering the reception area of Jesse S. Wooley's photography studio in Ballston Spa, New York, could not have doubted the range of portrait options available to them. As this image attests, photographs in a variety formats adorned the walls, filled glass-fronted cases, and were arranged on nearly every surface, including that of the studio's large retail case. There, a display box positioned at one end of the countertop held more than a dozen examples of photographic jewelry, many containing portraits of female subjects. Wooley's prominent presentation of photographic jewelry underscores the enduring appeal and marketability of this form of popular portraiture.    "
104123,"New York City served as home to the studios of many of the nation's leading daguerreotypists, including Jeremiah Gurney, whose establishment was featured in an 1853 newspaper article accompanied by this illustration. Depicting the handsomely appointed reception room, or ""saloon,"" of Gurney's gallery at 349 Broadway, the image shows well-dressed men and women engaged in a variety of activities-from waiting to have their portraits made, to choosing a case for a newly created daguerreotype, to promenading about the room as they admire daguerreotypes and other works that line the walls. As the writer of the corresponding article observed, ""To spend an afternoon in inspecting the extensive portrait galleries of the daguerrean [sic] rooms of the city is beginning to be classed among the amusements of New York.""  "
104125,"As this advertisement makes clear, photographic jewelry figured prominently among the offerings of M. M. Lawrence's Gallery, where likenesses ""from the smallest Locket to Life size"" were marketed to the public. Born in 1808, Martin M. Lawrence was apprenticed to a jeweler at sixteen and earned his living as a watchmaker before learning to make daguerreotypes in 1842 and establishing his first studio. By the time he opened his new gallery at 381 Broadway in 1853, Lawrence could offer his patrons a range of choices from daguerreotypes and paper-print photographs to ""a great variety of beautiful . . . Lockets, Pins, Rings, &c.""    Published in The Illustrated American Biography, volume 2  "
104128,"When the Meade Brothers opened their new American Daguerreotype Galleries at 233 Broadway on April 1, 1850, the Albany Morning Express reported,   They occupy four stories of a large building which has just been erected; arranged expressly for their business. The reception room on the first floor above the street is sixty feet deep, superbly furnished and finished in the most magnificent style. Back of this is their stock room filled with every variety of goods in their line. The third and fourth stories are fitted for drawing rooms, parlours and dressing rooms adapted to the comfort and accommodation of visitors. The fifth story is used as an operating room. . . . There is nothing lacking to render it the most complete Daguerreotype establishment in this or any other country.  In addition to its many amenities, the gallery occupied a prime location only a short distance from the celebrated Astor House hotel."

Joining the New York Illustrated News as a staff illustrator in 1860, he became a “special artist” to the Army of the Potomac when war broke out. Hired away by Harper’s Weekly, Waud continued his assignment with the army, covering battles from Bull Run in 1861 to Petersburg in 1865. As an eyewitness, Waud perfected the skill of sketching combat scenes and army life quickly yet accurately.  The accompanying War Department pass permitted Waud to travel through military lines to Fortress Monroe, held by the Union throughout the war even though it was deep in enemy territory, at the entrance of southeastern Virginia’s vast harbor."

104164,"Born Shippensburg, Pennsylvania     After his graduation from the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and his ordination, William Linn served as a chaplain in the Continental army. Linn, a Presbyterian, presided over several churches; he also served as regent of the University of the State of New York and as president pro tempore and trustee of Queens College (now Rutgers). As the first chaplain of the United States House of Representatives (1789-91), Linn continued the Continental Congress's tradition of beginning proceedings with a prayer. The artist of this miniature captures Linn's intense gaze and contrasts his ministerial collar, fair complexion, and somber clothing with the bold red background."
104177,"One of the most important businessmen in twentieth-century America, Ray Kroc created one of the world's most visible worldwide brands with the McDonald's fast-food empire. Kroc, a high-school dropout, was working as a traveling salesman in 1954 when he visited a California restaurant founded by Richard and Maurice McDonald that produced inexpensive meals on an assembly-line basis. Kroc bought into the business and grew the company by pioneering the franchising business, which sold a prepackaged, standardized operation to local operators for a fee and a percentage of gross sales. One reason for the brand's continued success was Kroc's fanatical attention to detail and quality control; as Kroc claimed, ""McDonald's people just take the hamburger business just a little more seriously than anybody."" Despite repeated challenges, McDonald's has continued to grow and prosper as the preeminent fast-food emporium; the chain serves more than fifty-four million customers per day worldwide. "
104179,"Randall Jarrell was born in Nashville. After his parents’ divorce he lived in Los Angeles (a place recollected in his long poem The Lost World) before returning to the South to attend Vanderbilt University. There, and later at Kenyon College, he studied with John Crowe Ransom and published poems throughout the 1930s; his first collection was Blood for a Stranger (1942). Jarrell served as an instructor in the Army Air Corps from 1942 to 1948, and his military poems, collected as Little Friend, Little Friend (1945), are among his most popular. Back in civilian life, Jarrell was a shrewd observer of postwar manners and morals. His ""Next Day"" traces the alienation of the 1950s housewife as she shops: ""As I look at my life, / I am afraid / Only that it will change, as I am changing,"" changing gently for the worse."
104206,"Born New York City    Arthur Miller was one of the most influential playwrights of the twentieth century, celebrated for his dramas of social conscience. He is best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning Death of a Salesman (1949) and The Crucible (1953), a play about the Salem witch trials inspired by Miller's hatred of McCarthyism. He continued to write dramatic works, short stories, and essays for the rest of life, and his masterpieces are still staged frequently. Miller and sculptor Philip Grausman were friends and neighbors in rural Connecticut. Critic Hilton Kramer found Grausman's refined portraits fascinating, noting that ""their surfaces have an astonishing clarity and finish, and they have a haunting physical presence."""
104231,"Born Rutherford, New Jersey  In the 1910s, avant-garde artists, writers, musicians, and intellectuals gathered at the New York home of patrons Walter and Louise Arensberg. Physician William Carlos Williams, also a prolific poet and writer, mingled with such Dada circle regulars as Marcel Duchamp, Francis Picabia, Man Ray, and the artist of this portrait, John Covert, an Arensberg cousin. Williams wrote poetry evoking the common imagery of American life and the rhythm of everyday speech. His initials and his poem “I saw the figure 5 in gold,” which suggested the fleeting glimpse of a fire engine at night, undoubtedly inspired this portrait. Covert’s fondness for cryptography, numerology, and coded and symbolic references relates to his early Dada experimentation, even though this work was probably made later. Here Covert abrades, pierces, and erases the already scarred paper, probing beyond the surface, turning two dimensions into three, and suggesting the complexity of Williams’s character. "
104236,"Born Atlanta, Georgia    Romare Bearden's image of Martin Luther King Jr., entitled Mountain Top, represents an homage to a fallen leader. As an African American artist who served in an all-black regiment during World War II, Bearden understood the continued prejudice King sought to combat and became a great admirer of the civil rights leader. The work's title and imagery are derived from a speech delivered by King in Memphis on April 3, 1968, the day before he was assassinated. King warned the crowd to anticipate ""difficult days"" and declared, ""But it doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop [and] I've seen the promised land."" He continued, in language that seems, in retrospect, prophetic, ""I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land."""

104658,"Born Plano, Texas    Cyclist Lance Armstrong began his career as a brash American with potential, winning both the CoreStates Race (United States National Championships) and the World Road Race Championships in 1993. But after the 1996 Olympics, he was diagnosed with a very aggressive form of testicular cancer. Overcoming his illness, he returned to cycling with a renewed focus, winning a record seven Tour de France races between 1999 and 2005. In 1997 he started the Lance Armstrong Foundation to fight cancer and raise awareness of the disease. This 2002 silkscreen poster, commemorating his fourth victory, was commissioned by helmet-maker Giro Sport Design to raise funds for the foundation and USA Cycling. Michael Schwab's design silhouettes Armstrong's black profile against patriotic stripes and features a yellow helmet, a color that suggests both the tour leader's jersey and the foundation's ""Livestrong"" wristbands.

104685,"There was no good reason for this film not to suck, Rolling Stone magazine noted about the 2003 movie Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, which was based on a Disney theme park ride. When Johnny Depp agreed to join the cast, his agent called him a lunatic. But Depp, who admired the unfettered looniness of the cartoons he watched with his young daughter, thought he could breathe new life into the pirate cliché. His Captain Jack Sparrow, inspired in part by rocker Keith Richards, was an original and hugely entertaining character. Foppish, outrageous, and fey, festooned with dreadlocks and beaded braids, Depp's pirate helped spawn a blockbuster hit and two sequels. This stand-up poster advertised the shameless zaniness of the movie, implying that Depp's imaginative portrayal, more than the costumes, special effects, and byzantine story, underlies the whole Pirates franchise."
104812,"Soon after assuming the presidency, President Kennedy approved a CIA plan originating with his predecessor, Dwight Eisenhower, for toppling Cuban leader Fidel Castro with an army of Cuban refugees covertly trained in the United States. Within hours after the start of the Bay of Pigs invasion on April 17, 1961, Castro's army overwhelmed the refugees on the beach. The fiasco exposed Kennedy to harsh criticism, many lambasting him for not providing sufficient air cover. Kennedy, disappointed by the advice he received from the Joint Chiefs of Staff and holdovers from the Eisenhower administration, moved rapidly to obtain Eisenhower's support. In this photograph, taken in late April, JFK and Ike walk the grounds of Camp David. Eisenhower always supported the president publicly, but privately, Ike, who in World War II commanded the largest amphibious invasion in history, bitterly criticized Kennedy's rejection of additional air cover."
104930,"Born Darke, Ohio    Outfitted for this portrait in a homemade floral-embroidered skirt and matching blouse, sharpshooter Annie Oakley balanced dual roles as a performer and a domestically well-versed woman during a time in which it was considered uncouth for ""proper"" women to use firearms or perform on stage. For seventeen years beginning in 1885, the year when this photograph is believed to have been taken, Oakley was a major attraction in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. Widely admired for her sharpshooting skills—the Lakota leader Sitting Bull gave her the nickname ""Little Sure Shot""—she was also applauded for her adherence to Victorian etiquette. Oakley personified the western cowgirl who could outshoot a man during the day and cook a roast for her husband at night."
104931,"Alexander Gardner took this portrait of Abraham Lincoln at the last sitting the president gave him, on Sunday, February 5, 1865. That same sitting produced the accidental masterpiece known as the “cracked-plate” portrait. The other photographs from this session had Gardner’s characteristic sharpness and clarity in the president’s face and expression. However, here, the president’s hands were fidgety, as evidenced by the blurring of the eyeglasses and the pencil that he holds as props. From this original image, Gardner and his assistants cleaned up the blurring during post-production editing or retouching, a nineteenth-century version of Photoshop. They also introduced a subtle variation: in some of the prints, instead of spectacles, Lincoln is holding a penknife, with which he would presumably sharpen the pencil."
104933,"After the American Revolution, renewed demand for imported tablewares from England kept the Herculaneum Pottery of Liverpool busy producing transfer-printed creamware decorated for an American market. Appearing on this pitcher, along with a distinctly un-American agricultural scene, are two especially popular subjects: an eagle and the apotheosis of Washington. John James Barralet, who designed the apotheosis print, depicted Washington rising from his tomb, assisted by Father Time and Immortality, and mourned by an eagle, an allegorical ""America,"" and a sorrowful Indian. Faith, Hope, and Charity appear in the background. Barralet's ambitious engraving spawned many copies, including Chinese reverse paintings on glass."
104940,"Grant’s reputation was built on his success in the western theater of the war, in particular his sieges of Forts Henry and Donelson in Tennessee and Kentucky (1862) and then Vicksburg in Mississippi (1863). Controlling the rivers was key to the North’s strategy of cutting the Confederacy in half. At Fort Donelson, Grant won a victory and gained a famous nickname. Facing Simon Buckner, Grant responded decisively when the Confederate general asked for the terms for his surrender: “No terms except an unconditional surrender can be accepted.” Buckner acceded, and by the accident of Grant’s initials he became known as “Unconditional Surrender” Grant. Ever since, American military doctrine has been based on the goal of unconditional surrender.  The victory on the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers led to Grant’s promotion to major general, as he is shown in this photograph.  Ulysses S. Grant     La reputación de Grant se f orjó sobre su éxito en el teatro occidental de la guerra, especialmente en sus sitios de Fort Henry y Fort Donelson en Tennessee y Kentucky (1862) y luego Vicksburg en Mississippi (1863). El control de los ríos fue clave para la estrategia del Norte de dividir la Confederación en dos partes. En Fort Donelson, Grant obtuvo una victoria y ganó un famoso sobrenombre. Frente a Simon Buckner, Grant respondió concluyentemente, cuando el general confederado le pidió los términos para su rendición: “No hay términos; sólo una rendición incondicional puede aceptarse”. Buckner accedió y, por la peculiaridad de las iniciales de Grant, se hizo conocido como “Unconditional Surrender” (“Rendición Incondicional”) Grant. Desde entonces, la doctrina militar estadounidense se ha basado en el objetivo de la rendición incondicional.  La victoria en los ríos Tennessee y Cumberland conllevó al ascenso de Grant a general de división, como se muestra en esta fotografía.

104981,"The daughter of the influential Missouri senator Thomas Hart Benton, Jessie Benton Frémont inherited her father's political acumen and his interest in the West. In 1841, the seventeen-year-old Jessie defied her family and eloped with the young military officer John C. Frémont. When he returned from expeditions into the West, she helped him draft the official reports that soon became vital guides for emigrants headed west. Throughout their nearly fifty-year marriage, Jessie was a powerful advocate for her husband, defending his career when necessary and actively supporting his rise in politics. In 1856, while he was campaigning for president, she appeared in public alongside him, a first among candidate's wives. She spent her life in the shadows of great men, yet she was effective in making herself heard. After her husband's retirement, she supported the family as an author, selling short stories and sketches to popular periodicals. "
104988,"Shortly after assuming command of Fort Monroe, in present-day Hampton, Virginia, in May 1861, General Benjamin F. Butler faced a dilemma. Three slaves—Frank Baker, Shepard Mallory, and James Townsend—had arrived at the Union-held fort, seeking protection after escaping from a Confederate work detail, and a Confederate officer was demanding their return under the terms of the Fugitive Slave Law. Butler refused, noting that as Virginia had seceded from the Union, he was ""under no constitutional obligations"" to return the slaves to ""a foreign county."" Instead, he would exercise his right to seize enemy ""property"" and retain the refugees as ""contraband of war."" Butler’s improvised solution to the fugitive slave question was allowed to stand by his superiors in Washington. It would be more than a year before the Confiscation Act of 1862 formally declared that slaves seeking refuge behind Union lines were to be deemed captives of war and granted their freedom."
105016,"Born Augusta, Georgia  At the start of the Civil War, when President Abraham Lincoln was desperately in search of Union generals to take the field and deliver victories, he was fortunate to have had General Montgomery C. Meigs behind the scenes in Washington. ""Meigs, one of the ablest graduates of the Military Academy, was kept from the command of troops by the inestimably important services he performed as Quartermaster General"" of the army, wrote Congressman James G. Blaine. Meigs was charged with supplying and equipping the Union army during four years of war. He recommended that the property of Mary Custis Lee, wife of Robert E. Lee, be used as a burial ground for federal servicemen, creating Arlington National Cemetery in 1864. After the war, Meigs, an engineer by training, supervised the construction of several Washington landmarks, including the Smithsonian’s Arts & Industries building and the Pension Office, now home to the National Building Museum."
105119,"Born Prince Edward County, Virginia  A Virginian by birth, Sterling Price is remembered foremost for his service to the Confederacy in the West and the defense of his adopted state of Missouri. Price was a veteran of the Mexican American War, and his popularity easily won him the Missouri governorship, where he served from 1853 to 1857. Initially opposed to secession, Price sided quickly with the Confederacy after Union forces seized the state militia’s Camp Jackson at St. Louis in 1861. Price served throughout the war, reaching the rank of major general, and saw action in Missouri, Mississippi, and Arkansas, including the battles of Wilson’s Creek, Iuka, and Pea Ridge, respectively. But a series of reverses in the western theater minimized his effectiveness and ultimately forced him and his depleted army into Texas. At war’s end, rather than surrender his broken army, he led what was left of it into Mexico."
105124,"Among the more remarkable stories of escape from slavery during the Civil War was that of Abraham, who was quite literally ""blown to freedom."" After failed attempts by the Union army to take the southern stronghold of Vicksburg, Mississippi, in the early months of 1863, General Ulysses Grant initiated a siege of the city that lasted from May 22 to July 4. During the final days of that siege, Union soldiers tunneled beneath earthen fortifications erected by Confederate forces and twice detonated powerful explosives. During the second blast, on July 1, seven enslaved workers used by the Confederates to dig countershafts were buried by debris. But one man—identified only as Abraham—was blown clear and fell to earth behind the Union lines. Though badly bruised, Abraham eventually recovered from his injuries. He remained with Union troops and later served as a cook on General James McPherson’s staff."
105126,"Marcel Duchamp cultivated a lifelong love for the game of chess and was an accomplished player. Arnold Rosenberg's portrait, which shows Duchamp as seen from below a sheet of glass on which chess pieces are arranged, seems to capture Duchamp involved in a game. However, the studied configuration of the chess pieces indicates that the photograph does not document a game, but instead consciously constructs a portrait of the artist. The perspective recalls Duchamp's works that require the viewer to look through sheets of glass, such as The Large Glass (1915-23) and To Be Looked at (from the Other Side of the Glass) with One Eye, Close to, for Almost an Hour) (1918). Rosenberg's photograph inverts the relationship between artist and viewer, for here it is Duchamp who is to be looked at through the glass. "

First with the Oakland A's, where he teamed with Jose Canseco to form the ""Bash Brothers,"" and then with the St. Louis Cardinals, the slugging first baseman hit 583 career home runs, the fifth most in history. In 1998 he hit 70 home runs, obliterating Roger Maris's record of 61 set in 1961. The season-long home-run derby between McGwire and the Cubs' Sammy Sosa galvanized fans and lifted baseball to new heights of popularity. But McGwire's mammoth season and his dramatically increased power numbers raised suspicions of drug use. In January 2010, after years of evasion, McGwire finally admitted that he had started using steroids midway through his career.  "
105351,"In describing Yosemite Valley's importance to modern society in 1912, naturalist John Muir explained, ""Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body and soul alike."" Few individuals at the turn of the twentieth century were more eloquent in describing nature's beauty or in popularizing the idea of wilderness as a restorative. Settling in northern California in 1868, Muir enjoyed walking great distances. Although he hiked throughout the West, he found the Sierras most appealing. There he devoted much attention to studying and writing about the natural environment. He helped to set aside Yosemite as a national park in 1890 and two years later founded the Sierra Club to foster a wider appreciation for land preservation. In his role as Sierra Club president, he worked with several U.S. presidents to establish federally protected forest reserves."
105356,"A key to Bill Clinton's successes as president, along with his resilience and personal affability, was his determination to govern through consensus. Major accomplishments such as welfare reform, the first budget surplus since the late 1960s, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and successful U.S. intervention in the Balkans stemmed from this pragmatic viewpoint. Other proposals, which galvanized opposition, such as universal health care, failed. His administration was plagued, however, by charges of real-estate schemes (""Whitewater"") dating back to his years as governor of Arkansas and the consequences of an affair with a White House intern. His denial under oath about this relationship led to his impeachment. He was not convicted in the Senate trial, however, and his popularity actually increased as Americans continued to admire Clinton for his political talents, quick intelligence, and determination.  Nancy Harris painted Clinton's portrait from life sittings in Chappaqua, New York, and Washington, D.C., in 2006 and 2007."
105366,"Born Kalamazoo, Michigan  During the late 1950s and early 1960s, cardiac surgeon Norman Shumway pioneered the techniques that made heart transplants possible. When Dr. Christiaan Barnard of South Africa performed the world’s first human heart transplant on December 3, 1967, he did so by utilizing procedures Shumway had developed. On January 6, 1968, Shumway performed the first successful heart transplant in the United States. His transplant method proved relatively easy for surgeons to master, but soon many abandoned the operation and called for a moratorium in the face of high death rates, as recipients’ bodies rejected their transplanted hearts. Shumway was undeterred, and throughout the 1970s he took the lead in devising numerous strategies to increase survival rates. The breakthrough that made heart transplants a common procedure came in 1980, when Shumway and his team proved that the new drug cyclosporine could be used successfully to fight organ rejection without compromising the patient’s immune system."
105376,"As a lawyer, Daniel Webster argued some of the most important Supreme Court cases of the early republican period. As senator from Massachusetts, Webster was for many years a major force in national politics. His portrait by George Linen was praised in a notice in the New-York Spectator in December of 1839:  An artist has at length been found who has succeeded in painting DANIEL WEBSTER. Every effort for that object has heretofore been a failure, but that of George Linen, the Scotch artist, who succeeded so admirably in catching the glowing intellectual expression of Mr. [Henry] Clay last year. This picture of Mr. Webster is also of the cabinet size, and it is truly admirable-entirely different from the dark, heavy, gloomy pictures of other artists-giving the fine intellectual developement [sic] of Mr. Webster's head, glowing with life and light, and masculine beauty."
105377,"George Linen studied painting at the Royal Scottish Academy in Edinburgh and worked as a portrait painter in England for about ten years before immigrating to the United States in 1834. He opened a studio in New York City and became a successful painter of small-format portraits. He exhibited regularly between 1837 and 1843 at the Apollo Association and the National Academy of Design. Nine of his portraits were praised in the New-York Spectator on May 18, 1837, as ""exceedingly well colored and carefully finished; and if Mr. Linen is young in the profession, as we suppose he is, they give promise of very high rank for him hereafter."" Two years later, he received a silver medal from the National Academy of Design for his portrait of Henry Clay. Although he is known primarily as a portrait painter, Linen also painted landscapes after retiring to a farm in New Jersey in 1868. "
105518,"Born Dallas, Texas     Together with Huey Newton, Bobby Seale founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in Oakland, California, in the fall of 1966. Having previously worked together at a neighborhood antipoverty center, the two broke with the NAACP to create a militant response to police brutality and to provide assistance programs to the city’s poor African American residents. When Newton was arrested for the murder of a policeman the following year, the Black Panthers became the national icon of militant black nationalists, who advocated armed resistance to white society. In this photograph, Seale speaks to an audience in Oakland that had gathered during Newton’s trial. Given the fiery rhetoric of its leaders, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was moved to describe the Panthers in 1969 as the greatest threat to American national security. By the time of Newton’s release on appeal in 1970, the organization had branch offices in more than thirty cities."
105523,"Duke Kahanamoku transformed the Hawaiian pastime of surfing into a worldwide competitive sport. He first made headlines as a record-breaking swimmer who introduced the flutter kick to the sport. Having won gold medals at the 1912 and 1920 Olympics, he was arguably the best swimmer of his era, described by the press as a ""human fish."" When he traveled away from Hawaii, he often brought his surfboard and guitar; surfing and music were two pursuits that provided him a sense of escape. In 1912 he introduced surfing to California, and two years later he awed crowds in Australia with his board skills. Kahanamoku developed his own line of surf clothing and experimented with smaller, lighter boards, an example of which appears in this early photograph. An easygoing, modest man, he later served thirteen consecutive terms as sheriff of Honolulu and became a revered icon during a transitional period in Hawaiian history."
105550,"Born Jersey City, New Jersey      Inspired by the upscale catering business she launched from her Westport, Connecticut, home in 1976, Martha Stewart developed a multimedia lifestyle empire that has made her one of the most successful businesswomen in American history. The popularity of Stewart’s first book, Entertaining, and subsequent magazine, Martha Stewart Living, spawned a series of illustrated publications and products that fueled the market for her personal brand of glorified domesticity—“a vision of grace and creativity in a world full of haste and shoddy goods.” In 1997 Stewart consolidated her popular magazines, syndicated television series, and other marketing ventures under the corporate umbrella of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia.  Stewart’s career faltered when she was convicted on charges stemming from an insider trading probe; David Levine’s drawing satirizes her much-publicized appearance in court carrying an expensive crocodile bag. But Stewart rebounded and remains a highly effective purveyor of lifestyle concepts and products."
105559,"While serving in the Ohio infantry, James A. Garfield was elected to Congress in 1862; he represented his home state for eighteen years. Nominated by the Republican Party as its presidential candidate in 1880, he was elected president and inaugurated on March 4, 1881. Garfield had served only four months in office when, on July 2, he was shot by religious fanatic Charles J. Guiteau. Mortally wounded, Garfield died in September. His assassination led to an outpouring of national mourning, which resulted in numerous full-length paintings and sculptures. This small figure appears to be a trial casting a larger statue in Washington, D.C., completed by John Quincy Adams Ward in 1887.  "
105627,"The scion of an established family in New York’s Hudson Valley, Franklin Roosevelt graduated from Harvard University and attended Columbia Law School. By 1905 he had married his distant cousin, Eleanor, and was practicing law in New York City without much enthusiasm. Drawn to politics, he was fascinated by the example of his famous fifth cousin, Theodore Roosevelt, whom Franklin declared to be ""the greatest man I ever knew."" In 1910, Democratic Party leaders in Dutchess County urged him to run for the state senate. A split in the Republican Party, along with Roosevelt’s energetic campaign, gave him an unexpected victory. By 1912—when this photograph was taken—he had enlisted as his adviser the politically savvy journalist Louis Howe, who would guide Roosevelt’s political career for the next twenty years. "
105632,"Alice Paul was the pivotal suffragist leader in the campaign that resulted in the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment in 1920. Following the completion of her Ph.D. in political science at the University of Pennsylvania-where she wrote a dissertation on the legal rights of women-Paul immersed herself in the women's suffrage movement. In 1916 she and Lucy Burns formed the National Women's Party and began using such public tactics as demonstrations, parades, picketing, and hunger strikes to spotlight their cause. Two years later, President Woodrow Wilson announced that women's suffrage was urgently needed as a ""war measure,"" and strongly urged Congress to pass the necessary legislation. Having helped to secure the Nineteenth Amendment, Paul continued to support women's causes, notably as the original author of a proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution in 1923."
105647,"Born Wamego, Kansas    Walter P. Chrysler began his career with the nation’s railroads, where he learned about all aspects of the industry. Executives at General Motors noticed him, and in 1912 the company hired him to manage the plant for the Buick Motor Division. Within three years, Chrysler had doubled the plant’s output and reduced costs. After leaving General Motors, Chrysler launched his first automobile, the Chrysler Six, in 1924 and with it the Chrysler Corporation. His company became the moving force behind innovative automobile designs, creating high-performance, moderately priced models. Chrysler is shown here in his office in the newly constructed Chrysler Building in New York City. At the time of his retirement in 1933, the Chrysler Corporation was America’s second-largest automobile maker, behind industry leader General Motors."
105648,"In the 1940s, Rodgers and Hammerstein ushered in the Golden Age of the Broadway musical by creating Oklahoma! (1943), Carousel (1945), and South Pacific (1949). Richard Rodgers had previously teamed with Lorenz Hart on such hits as Pal Joey (1940), and Oscar Hammerstein had notably worked with Jerome Kern on Show Boat (1927), but the combination of composer Rodgers and lyricist Hammerstein in 1943 emerged as the most successful collaboration in American musical theater. Their key contribution was to fuse a play's dramatic action with music and dance, which they first did with their milestone production of Oklahoma! Their partnership, which continued until Hammerstein's death in 1960, produced thirty-four Tony Awards, fifteen Academy Awards, two Pulitzer Prizes, two Grammy Awards, and two Emmy Awards."
105656,"A fixture in political Washington, William Winston Seaton partnered with his brother-in-law, Joseph Gales, to edit and publish the National Intelligencer, the leading paper for the Whig Party. Seaton retired from the paper in 1860. The duo were also the de facto official recorders of congressional debates; their Annals of Congress (known familiarly to historians as “Gales and Seaton”) was a record of the national government to 1837. Seaton also served in the local government and was the city’s mayor from 1840 to 1850, a critical period in the growth of Washington’s infrastructure."
105773,"Born Sighet, Romania    ""Never again."" Elie Wiesel embodies the necessity of bearing continual witness against the Holocaust so that future genocides might be prevented. Prisoner number A-7713, Wiesel survived the concentration camps and wrote a powerful memoir, Night (1960), in an attempt to convey the nightmare of the camps to the world. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, both for his testimony about the Holocaust and his work for peace and human dignity.   "
105774,"Born Norton, Massachusetts    Lawyer Daniel Leonard became one of the most notorious Loyalists in Britain's North American colonies. In 1774 Leonard published ""Massachusettensis,"" a series of widely reprinted articles in support of British efforts to quash the colonial rebellion. The articles sparked one of the most famous debates of the American Revolution between Leonard and John Adams. Leonard fled to Bermuda when British troops evacuated Boston in 1776, months before the colonies declared independence from Britain.    This tiny miniature, meant to be worn as a bracelet, remained in the possession of Leonard's descendants until the National Portrait Gallery acquired it in 2007.  "
105784,"Born Rupert, Vermont    As a youth, Ichabod Spencer attended a religious revival that inspired him to profess his Christian faith. Following theological studies at Union College in Schenectady, New York, Spencer was licensed to preach in 1826. Several years later, he assumed the pastorate of the Second Presbyterian Church of Brooklyn, where he served for the remainder of his career. One of the founders of the Union Theological Seminary in New York City in 1836, Spencer was a highly regarded pastoral counselor who earned praise for his two-volume work, A Pastor's Sketches; or, Conversations with Anxious Inquirers Respecting Salvation (1851-53)."
105785,"By dint of longevity, Stanley Kunitz became the grand old man of American poetry, but he owes his eminence to the quality of his writing, not just his endurance. Born in Worcester, Massachusetts, and educated at Harvard, his first book of poetry was published in 1930 and gained little attention. After serving in the army during World War II, he took teaching jobs at various northeastern colleges. Columbia University hired him in 1963, and Kunitz remained there until 1985. He was a late-bloomer as a poet and had difficulty finding and keeping publishers; when his Selected Poems was finally published in 1958 it received the Pulitzer Prize. Kunitz, who loved gardening, was a nature poet in the same sense as the English metaphysical poets of the seventeenth century: he used nature as the screen through which to view and analyze human nature."
105786,"Born Nantucket, Massachusetts    Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized the 1848 Seneca Falls Convention that launched the women's movement in the United States. As a Quaker and like most reformers in this era, she was drawn to the antislavery cause, helping to found Philadelphia's Female Anti-Slavery Society. This experience convinced her that women had a special role in reform movements and that the struggle for women's rights would be essential for reform causes in America. She urged women to ""go on-not asking favors, but claiming as a right the removal of all hindrances to her elevation in the scale of being."""
105790,"Although Brian O’Doherty has engaged with multiple concepts of identity throughout his career, he is best known for inventing the persona of Patrick Ireland in 1972, partially in response to the Bloody Sunday killings that year in Northern Ireland. “Patrick Ireland” created richly conceptual works of art for thirty-six years, until O’Doherty symbolically killed and buried him in 2008.  O’Doherty moved from Ireland to the United States for a medical fellowship at Harvard in 1957. Although he had previously been drawing and painting, at this time he determined to leave the medical profession and work in the visual arts. Transitional Head, a rare self-portrait painting, dates from that year of personal change. The artist used bars of pigment to define the picture plane and deny the apparent three-dimensionality of the painted head. "
105792,"Tennis star Pete Sampras, the number-one-ranked world champion from 1993 to 1998-and eventual seven-time Wimbledon winner-was a fan of the milk mustache ads and volunteered to be a celebrity subject. The famous campaign was launched in 1995 to boost sales by advertising the health benefits of adults drinking milk. From the beginning, the advertising agency used humor to convey its educational message. The photographs by Annie Leibovitz combined sexy bodies with silly faces and conflated notions of childhood (sloppy milk drinking), adulthood (facial hair), and old age (white muscache). The goofy pictures of popular culture stars proved an instant hit, generating publicity, awards, and parodies. The Sampras poster emphasized his superb physique and quirky habit of tossing a towel over his head between sets. But it says more about 1990s celebrity and its commercial potential than about Sampras's actual prowess on the courts. "
105796,"   Born Albany, Georgia    Blind by age five, singer-composer Ray Charles learned the rudiments of his musicianship at a school for the deaf and blind in Florida. In his early performing career, he modeled his style largely on singer Nat ""King"" Cole. By the early 1950s, however, he was developing an original blend of blues and gospel that would lead to his first major hit recording, ""I’ve Got a Woman,"" and ultimately make him the ""father of soul music."" The winner of eleven Grammy Awards and a Kennedy Center Honors award, Charles had many hits that have long since become pop music classics, including ""Georgia on My Mind"" and ""Hit the Road, Jack."" He also exercised enormous influence on other performers, and many experts number him among the most important American musicians of his time. "
105798,"   Born in Bascom, Florida  Faye Dunaway debuted on Broadway in 1962 in a production of A Man for All Seasons and went on to build one of the most impressive film acting careers of the 1960s and 1970s. Particularly noteworthy was her Oscar-nominated role opposite Warren Beatty in Bonnie and Clyde (1968), as well as playing the female lead in Chinatown (1974). She won an Oscar for her role in Network (1976). Dunaway continued to work steadily in the 1980s but may have fallen victim to Hollywood’s antipathy to aging actresses. Playing Joan Crawford in the much-mocked bio-pic Mommie Dearest also didn’t help her career. With film roles dwindling, she has appeared frequently on television, acting in serials or made-for-TV movies. There was no question about her fame in 1978, however, when she was selected for the ""Blackglama"" ranch mink poster campaign."
105827,"Known as the ""queen of Tejano music,"" Selena Quintanilla-Pérez brought wide recognition to this South Texas blend of Mexican and American musical styles. Her powerful voice made her the idol of fans on both sides of the border. Wearing a bustier, tight pants, and a pouting smile, Selena set a new standard for Latin beauty, and her self-confidence on stage brought comparisons with Madonna. In 1990 she released Ven Conmigo, the first Tejano album by a female artist to go gold, and soon she had her own clothing line and national product endorsements. She won a Grammy Award in 1993, but her life ended tragically two years later, when a former president of her fan club shot and killed her. Selena’s death at age twenty-three caused a huge outpouring of grief, and her legend then converged with the rising stardom of fellow Latina singer Jennifer Lopez, who gave a strong performance in her first leading role in Selena (1997)."
105856,"A remarkably versatile and exuberant performer, Yo-Yo Ma is the preeminent cellist of our time. Born in Paris to Chinese parents, he was a prodigy, and at age eight, he appeared on American television in a concert conducted by Leonard Bernstein. He studied music at Julliard and has a liberal arts degree from Harvard. Besides having played with most of the world's major orchestras, Ma also plays with chamber groups and has done considerable crossover work, including soundtracks for such films as Seven Years in Tibet and Memoirs of a Geisha. He currently plays with his own Silk Road Ensemble, which brings together musicians from diverse countries historically linked by the Silk Road. This casual and engaging portrait was created when he was honored by the Lotos Club in New York City, which featured the image on the evening's menu."
105858,"Art critic Donald Kuspit has described William Beckman's self-portraits as the core of the artist's life's work as a realist painter: ""I regard Beckman's self-obsession as the climactic statement of what Baudelaire called 'the cult of the self' that informs modern art."" Always searching for certainty, Beckman is forever discontented with what he finds in his self-portraits, but the paintings that result from the journey are masterpieces of close scrutiny. His reputation has grown steadily since his first one-man show at New York's Allan Stone Gallery in 1970. Beckman has consistently studied the complexities of his subjects in highly detailed, often large-scale drawings and paintings through the decades when figuration was not as critically accepted as abstraction and conceptual art.   "
105882,"Born Hardin County, Kentucky  Mathew Brady’s first portrait of Abraham Lincoln played a significant role in shaping Lincoln’s public image during the 1860 presidential campaign. Taken on February 27, 1860—the day Lincoln delivered his stirring address on the question of slavery in the territories at the Cooper Union in New York City—Brady’s carefully crafted image revealed a candidate whose dignified bearing stood in sharp contrast to the unflattering characterizations circulated by his detractors. In the months before the November election, Brady’s Lincoln portrait circulated in a variety of formats, including this brooch-like campaign pin by Boston photographer George Clark, who created it by copying Brady’s original."
106167,"Born Rushford, New York  This group photograph was taken at the Carlisle Indian School in 1880. It includes the school’s founder and superintendent, Richard H. Pratt, seated on the steps of a wooden bandstand alongside the Lakota chief Spotted Tail and three unidentified Quaker women from Philadelphia. A soldier who first saw action during the Civil War and later in several campaigns against hostile Native American groups in the West, Pratt believed that formal education was vital to the future welfare of tribal communities. In 1879, while still in the U.S. Army, Pratt established a school in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, where he promoted his educational philosophy of forced assimilation into American culture, a policy that owed much to his experiences in the military. As he once explained, he believed it was necessary to ""kill the Indian to save the man."" "
106304,"Before the Reign of Terror began in 1793, Laurent Dabos, an artist from Toulouse undertook (apparently for the purpose of engraving) small full-length portraits of twelve luminaries of the French Revolution-Thomas Paine the only non-Frenchman among them. The bust version here shows Paine about the time he reached France. Well known as the author of Common Sense and Rights of Man, he was greeted by cannon salutes and cries of ""Vive Thomas Paine.""   Outlawed in England, Paine was never able to return to his native land, but his portrait was carried there-possibly by a member of the radical Anglo contingent in Paris-and was discovered some years ago in Northumberland. "
106306,"Broadside advertisement for L.F.W. Mark  In addition to those early photographers who established their studios in fixed locations, many others worked as itinerants who plied their trade for a brief time in one locale before moving on to another. One such itinerant was the photographer and ambrotypist L.F.W. Mark, who advertised his services via a broadside that included blanks that could be filled in to note his current location. The handsomely appointed studio pictured at the top of Mark’s broadside was probably a far cry from the makeshift one he would have set up in a hotel or boarding house in the communities he visited."
106339,"Playwright Wendy Wasserstein introduced theatergoers to a type of female character rarely seen before: the smart, successful, yet often self-doubting woman trying to find her place in modern society. Drawing often from personal experience, Wasserstein authored eleven plays during her career, which was cut short by lymphoma at age fifty-five. Her most successful production, The Heidi Chronicles, won both the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the Tony Award for best play in 1989. In this and other plays Wasserstein created memorable heroines confronting-often with great humor-the challenges associated with societal expectations and personal desires. In 1998, Wasserstein, a lifelong New Yorker, founded a program to bring New York high school students to the theater, hoping to share her love of the stage with a new generation.  Susan Johann made this photograph just after Wasserstein received the news that she had won the Pulitzer Prize. "
106406,"Born Delta, Louisiana  One of the most successful African American entrepreneurs of the early twentieth century, Madam C. J. Walker created a line of phenomenally popular hair care and beauty products that fueled a business empire. In 1905, after devising a restorative formula that was used in combination with her improved steel hot comb to treat thinning and damaged hair, she began marketing her products and beauty regimen to the black community. During a troubled period in the history of race relations in America, Walker built a lucrative enterprise that employed thousands who served as her agents or manufactured her beauty aids. By the time of her death, she was reputed to be the first female African American millionaire.   This portrait by famed African American photographer Addison N. Scurlock became Walker’s trademark image. It was featured on packaging for her products and used extensively in her advertising."
106437,"Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh and Martin Luther King Jr. at the Illinois Rally for Civil Rights, June 21, 1964  Two days after the U.S. Senate passed the Civil Rights Bill of 1964, Martin Luther King spoke before a crowd of more than 57,000 during a rally at Soldiers’ Field in Chicago. While declaring that approval of the landmark legislation heralded a ""dawn of new hope,"" King reminded his listeners that ""passage of the civil rights bill does not mean we have reached the end of the civil rights struggle. We have come a long way in our journey, but we have a long, long way to go."" King’s address was preceded by remarks from Notre Dame University president and United States Civil Rights Commission member the Reverend Theodore M. Hesburgh. One of many white members of the clergy to participate in the rally, Hesburgh told the crowd, ""We want to strive for human dignity with you."" At the close of the program, King and Hesburgh clasped hands in solidarity while singing ""We Shall Overcome."" "
106673,"Born Braintree (now Quincy), Massachusetts  Founding Father John Adams was a powerful political thinker and served as George Washington’s vice president for eight years. Gaining the presidency himself in 1801, Adams was not able to win a second term. However, during the period after his presidency, many publishers, authors, and artists celebrated him through printed portraits and illustrated biographies. The young Boston engraver Nathaniel Dearborn may have been inspired by a similar sense of populist patriotism when he created this print of Adams. Dearborn’s engraving was a copy after David Edwin’s 1800 print, which was itself a copy of a painting by Edward Savage. Despite its lack of pretension, the image was undoubtedly recognizable and might have found a ready market in the Boston area."
106677,"Born Westmoreland County, Virginia  One of the most widely admired figures in American history, George Washington commanded the respect of his peers as much as that of subsequent generations. ""He was in every sense of the words a wise, a good, and great man,"" effused Thomas Jefferson. During the Revolutionary War, Washington provided critical military leadership. As the nation’s first president, he famously retired from office after eight years, creating a precedent for the peaceful transition of power that would characterize the practice of democracy in the new United States.  This rare engraving by the Scottish-born engraver John Roberts testifies to the birth of a broad demand for images of this Founding Father. Based on a miniature copy of Gilbert Stuart’s celebrated 1796 Athenaeum portrait by Benjamin Trott, Roberts developed a new technique of working his plate, creating a mezzotint of exquisite quality."
106678,"In 1793 Massachusetts artist Edward Savage, who was in London learning various printmaking skills, published a mezzotint engraving of George Washington based on two of his own paintings of the president. That print, and this close variant of it, updated the image of Washington. Dressed in black velvet rather than the usual military uniform, Washington contemplates a plan of the new federal city and the future of the government it was built to accommodate. Here was a statesman, rather than a soldier, a man with age, wisdom, and dignity in his face. Savage's mezzotints and the many other prints copied from them established this image as one of the most popular of Washington's presidential years.  "
106717,"Born in Meridian, Mississippi     James Chaney's mother was a domestic servant and his father was a plasterer. He became involved in the civil rights struggle while still in high school, and was suspended for a week from his Catholic school for wearing a paper badge with ""N.A.A.C.P"" on it. In October 1963 he volunteered at the Meridian office of CORE, and the following summer impressed Michael Schwerner, who had been made head of the office. Schwerner recommended Chaney for a full-time post with CORE. During that summer Chaney became involved with CORE's ""Freedom Summer"" campaign. "
106718,"Born New York City    Andrew Goodman was born on New York's Upper West Side, the second of three sons of a well-to-do family heavily invested in causes devoted to social justice and civil rights. He briefly attended the University of Wisconsin in Madison, returned to New York, acted in off-Broadway productions, and attended Queens College. In 1964 he volunteered, along with fellow activist Michael Schwerner, for CORE's ""Freedom Summer"" campaign to register blacks to vote in Mississippi. "
106719,"Born New York City    An early civil rights activist, Michael Schwerner integrated Cornell University's chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity while still a student. While attending Columbia University's School of Social Work, he headed a local chapter of CORE on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Schwerner and his wife Rita volunteered for CORE's 1964 ""Freedom Summer"" campaign to register black voters in Mississippi. They were assigned to head a field office near Meridian, where they set up a library for blacks denied access to the town library. Michael Schwerner's murder took place on June 21, 1964, near Philadelphia, Mississippi, where he and fellow CORE workers James Chaney and Andrew Goodman had gone to hold voter registration rallies. "
106739,"In his self-portrait we see artist Will Barnet at a window in his Long Island studio, which looks out on Gardiner's Bay, near East Hampton. During his long career as a painter, printmaker, and teacher, Barnet developed a strong personal style that emphasizes spare outlines and muted colors. His companion here is the crow who was a neighbor's pet and at times a visitor to Barnet's studio. The crow's pose mimics the artist's silhouette and gaze. Crows also appear in Barnet's other paintings of the late 1970s and early 1980s, around the time of the self-portrait. Some have mythical themes and are titled Circe, Hera, Persephone, and The Three Muses, and in these works, birds contribute a mood of almost mysterious stillness. "
106744,"Arnold Rosenberg here uses a multiple exposure technique to create a ghostly image, layering a photograph of Duchamp from the front, with striped shirt and arm raised, over a darker image of the artist in profile, framed by an illuminated window. Although Duchamp's features can be vaguely discerned through the shadows, his face is not visible in the frontal portrait, heightening the spectral effect of the photograph. Rosenberg employs a variety of visual devices that reference Duchamp's self-representation, such as the silhouette, which Duchamp often used to portray himself, and the shadow. The layered images, which at points merge together, visually express the concepts of transformation and passage, ideas that fascinated Duchamp. Rosenberg's portrait suggests the ultimate impenetrability of likeness, and perhaps even of identity itself. "
106825,"Haywood Patterson was one of nine African American teenagers who were falsely accused in 1931 of raping two white women aboard a freight train. Despite an absence of due process and a fair trial, Patterson and seven others were found guilty in an Alabama courtroom and sentenced to death. The railroading of the ""Scottsboro Boys"" received national attention and worldwide condemnation. Despite numerous retrials, Patterson spent the next sixteen years in prison before escaping to Michigan, where the governor refused to extradite him. During this period, Patterson agreed to recount the horrific story of his imprisonment to a New York author. This photograph was made to publicize the 1950 release of the book that resulted from this exchange, a work that one reviewer observed ""will leave you with a deep sense of personal shame if you are at all concerned with the basic American concepts of fair play and justice."""
106850,"The Shackle Broken—By the Genius of Freedom  The central vignette in this hand-colored lithograph celebrates the ""great speech"" on civil rights for African Americans delivered by Congressman Robert B. Elliott of South Carolina on January 6, 1874. Elliott served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1871 to 1874 and was one of the few men of color elected to Congress from the former Confederate states. The Civil Rights Act of 1875 guaranteed equality for African Americans at the ballot box, on juries, and in public accommodations and transportation. Yet in 1877, with the end of Reconstruction and the removal of federal troops throughout the South, they faced a new era of subjugation and discrimination that would virtually eradicate the recent gains they had made and would last until the civil rights movement of the 1960s."
106906,"Born Martinsburg, Virginia (now West Virginia)    Belle Boyd was one of the Confederacy's most well-known spies. She first attracted the notice of occupying Union troops in her hometown of Martinsburg, Virginia, in July 1861 when she shot and killed an abusive soldier for attempting to replace the Confederate flag at her house with the Federal banner. As a result, Union guards were detailed to protect the property. In the months that followed, Boyd, who was not yet twenty, took full advantage of being in the midst of Yankees to eavesdrop and gather military information, which she smuggled, sometimes personally, to nearby Southern camps. Boyd's derring-do led to her arrest and imprisonment on several occasions and won her notoriety in both the South and North. In May 1864, Boyd sailed to England, became an actress, and published her memoirs, Belle Boyd in Camp and Prison (1865).   "
106907,"Born Port Tobacco, Maryland   Rose O’Neal Greenhow was the Confederacy’s most celebrated female spy at the start of the Civil War. A popular Washington widow and hostess, she moved easily in the social circles of the nation’s capital. Few were better connected than she when hostilities commenced in the spring of 1861. An ardent southern sympathizer, she used her ample charms and guile to pass along information on the defenses of Washington and Union troop movements to Confederate officials. She is credited with alerting the rebels of enemy military operations just prior to the Battle of Manassas. The success of her clandestine activities can be gauged by the surveillance she received from the noted detective Allan Pinkerton. Although he put Greenhow under house arrest and ultimately had her confined, she was always considered a security risk, given her extensive social connections.   This photograph of Greenhow with her daughter Rose was taken for Mathew Brady’s studio by Alexander Gardner at the Old Capitol Prison in 1862."
106910,"With victory for the Union all but certain after the fall of Richmond on April 3, 1865, Abraham Lincoln traveled by boat to the former Confederate capital on April 4, accompanied by a party that included his young son Tad, Admiral David Dixon Porter, and a small contingent of marines. Within moments of disembarking, Lincoln was recognized by a liberated bondsman who shouted, ""Bless the Lord, there is the great Messiah! Glory, Hallelujah!"" As the president walked from the waterfront to the Virginia statehouse, thousands of the city’s newly freed men, women, and children rushed to see the man they greeted as their liberator. As one contemporary observed, ""Probably no mortal ever received such a greeting of prayers and tears and blessing as that which was conferred upon Abraham Lincoln by [those] whom the war had emancipated."" Created by an eyewitness, this drawing captures the jubilation of that moment."
106912,"Born Providence, Rhode Island    The early work of contemporary novelist Cormac McCarthy, including Suttree (1979) and Blood Meridian (1985), was often violent and macabre. After moving from Tennessee to Texas, he began to explore the classic western theme of the individual on the frontier; his Border Trilogy (1992-98) masterfully mixed the old and the new West. Now living near Santa Fe, McCarthy is writing what has been called post-apocalyptic fiction; The Road (2006) won the Pulitzer Prize for its depiction of life after a secular apocalypse.   McCarthy was the only writer in residence as a fellow at the Santa Fe Institute when British photorealist painter Andrew Tift met and photographed him there in 2003 for a series of portraits. McCarthy, who is known for being reclusive, has said that talking with the scientists at the research institute ""helps him to think."""
106913,"Born New York City    Murray Gell-Mann's concept of the ""eightfold way"" with regard to particle coherence and predictability has been a vital tool in enlarging knowledge of nuclear particles. For this work on the theory of elementary particles, he received the Nobel Prize in 1969, and his 1994 book The Quark and the Jaguar made these theories accessible to the general reader. Gell-Mann is currently the Robert Andrews Milliken Professor Emeritus at the California Institute of Technology.    Painter Andrew Tift met and photographed Gell-Mann in 2003 at the Santa Fe Institute, where Gell-Mann is a distinguished fellow and trustee. Tift loved his face: ""He really had the 'Mad Professor' look, a bit like Einstein, a wonderful face that I knew I had to capture."""
106926,"Born Edmonton, Alberta, Canada     Emmy Award–winning actor and Parkinson’s research advocate Michael J. Fox endeared himself to legions of fans with his roles on the sitcoms Family Ties (1982–89) and Spin City (1996–2001), and as Marty McFly in the popular Back to the Future film trilogy (1985–90). Only thirty years old when he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease—a degenerative neurological disorder—he did not make his condition known to the public until 1998. Since then, Fox has continued his acting career, aided by drugs that help him manage his Parkinson’s symptoms. In 2000 he established the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research with the goals of finding a cure for the disease and supporting the development of improved therapies for those living with it. In this portrait, Fox’s steely gaze mirrors the determination of the man whose foundation has already generated more than $450 million to fund its ambitious research objectives.    Michael J.

106929,"Born Longview, Texas  Katy Grannan’s 2007 photograph of Forest Whitaker, created for the New York Times Sunday Magazine, captures the award-winning actor in a gritty urban environment that echoes his upbringing in South Central Los Angeles. Whitaker’s contemplative expression also suggests the vision that has contributed to his success. Known for his compelling depictions of complex characters, Whitaker received an Academy Award for his performance in The Last King of Scotland (2006). An athlete in his youth, Whitaker, who received a football scholarship to attend California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, shifted focus after a debilitating injury, going on to study opera and drama, which he had first discovered in high school. For Grannan, pictures such as this one provide a way of creating new insight. As she has reflected: ""Photography is a kind of permission—it’s a way in."""
106995,"Born New York City  Thomas Ash ""succeeded to the long established and well known manufactory of Fancy and Windsor Chairs"" at 33 John Street in New York City upon the death of his father, William, in 1815. The Ash proprietorship employed ""a number of the very best and most tasteful workmen"" and advertised its ability to make custom orders, in addition to selling its inventory of Windsor chairs, fancy ballback armchairs, and rush-bottomed settees with vertical spindles. Indicative of his out-of-state market, Ash shipped seventy-one ""bundles"" of chairs to Savannah, Georgia, in May 1815.  Ash also made frames for paintings, which may have provided the opportunity for this rare depiction of an early American artisan. It is one of the first works by the young Thomas Sully, who later became the preeminent American portrait painter of the Jacksonian era."
107206,"Born Louisville, Kentucky    In February 2005, Hunter S. Thompson, famous for over-the-top ""gonzo"" journalism and his unrestrained Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, committed suicide. Ralph Steadman, his illustrator-collaborator and friend, created this print, Gonzo Memorial, imagining Thompson's funeral as a way to raise money to assist his widow. Here, Thompson is represented as a flying peacock wearing the writer's signature hat while the ink-trailing creature in the foreground is a stand-in for Steadman. The two-thumbed fist, a personal logo for Thompson, tops the tower planned to launch his ashes into space. Six months after Thompson's death, his final wishes were realized in a private funeral at his home in Colorado, during which his remains were successfully launched from a ""gonzo tower."" Below the print are signatures from Thompson's wife and some of his friends, including Bill Murray, Johnny Depp, and Kurt Vonnegut. "
107387,"Born Brooklyn, New York  Playwright Wendy Wasserstein introduced theatergoers to a type of female character rarely seen before: the smart, successful, yet often self-doubting woman trying to find her place in modern society. Drawing often from personal experience, Wasserstein authored eleven plays during her career, which was cut short by lymphoma at age fifty-five. Her most successful production, The Heidi Chronicles, won both the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the Tony Award for best play in 1989. In 1998, Wasserstein, a lifelong New Yorker, founded a program to bring New York high school students to the theater, hoping to share her love of the stage with a new generation.  Photographer Jill Krementz carved out a successful career as a photojournalist and then became a portrait photographer and author. Here she captures Wasserstein at her home in New York City."
107478,"In 1968 Laura Welch graduated from Southern Methodist University and became an elementary school teacher in Dallas. She then obtained a master of science degree from the University of Texas at Austin, and was employed as a librarian. In 1977 she married George W. Bush, and in 1981 gave birth to twin daughters. During the years her husband was governor of Texas, she worked for children's causes and on issues dealing with women's health, literacy, and libraries. As first lady of the United States, Laura Bush has continued to focus on those issues. In November 2001 she delivered the weekly presidential radio address on the hardships suffered by women in Afghanistan. She was the first first lady-and the only person other than the president-to use this format to speak to the national and international community on an important social issue.     Laura Bush chose Aleksander Titovets, a Russian-trained painter who now lives in Texas, to paint her portrait for the National Portrait Gallery.  "
107499,"Beginning her career at the age of sixteen as a dancer at New York's Cotton Club, Lena Horne made her initial Broadway appearance in 1939. When she signed with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer a few years later, she became the first African American performer to be awarded a contract with a major film studio, although her parts were made so they could be edited out for southern venues. She was also actively involved with the cause of civil rights and helped to break down important color barriers in the entertainment industry: while touring with the USO during World War II, she refused to perform for segregated audiences, and as an actress, she fought the stereotypical roles typically offered to African Americans. This portrait was taken by Florence Meyer Homolka, an accomplished portraitist who photographed many prominent individuals in New York's theatrical and literary world."
107500,"Born Vienna, Austria  ""I am fascinated by cruelty, fear, horror and death,"" the Viennese-born, Hollywood-transplanted film director once said. Garnering fame during the early years of German cinema with films such as Metropolis (1927) and his first sound film M (1931), Lang fled Nazi Germany for the United States in 1934. Following the success of his first American production, Fury (1936), he went on to direct twenty feature films. Lang was preoccupied by violence and populated the worlds of his critically acclaimed pictures—most notably You Only Live Once (1937), Ministry of Fear (1944), and While the City Sleeps (1956)—with psychopaths, master criminals, prostitutes, child murderers, and sadists. One of the leading filmmakers of his time, Lang pushed the creative boundaries of his craft and the subjects depicted therein. Yet he always remained an outsider in Hollywood, suffering from a reputation as an egocentric despot ever seeking unattainable perfection."
108047,"Born Cambridge, Ohio    A military pilot who distinguished himself in World War II and the Korean War, John Glenn came to widespread public attention as one of the Mercury Seven, the original group of astronauts chosen to participate in the American effort to explore outer space. In 1962, Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth. Retiring from the space program two years later, he participated in a number of successful business ventures and in 1970 was elected as a senator from his native Ohio. Over the next several decades, he became one of the Senate’s most respected and influential members. In 1998, at the age of seventy-seven, Glenn became the oldest astronaut to fly in space. This watercolor sketch, made from life by Henry Casselli, captures the astronaut in a moment of reflection just before his 1998 launch."
108048,"This portrait of astronaut Robert Crippen by Henry Casselli captures the drama and occasional frustrations associated with space flight. ""First attempt at launch-just after discovering that Crip's helmet had a pressure leak and a back up was brought in-he was not pleased,"" runs Casselli's commentary on the portrait. Casselli's watercolor and graphite study of the astronaut documents preparations for the first launch of the space shuttle. The first reusable spaceship, its deployment marked a new moment in space history. Crippen was already an experienced astronaut, having served on the crew of Skylab and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project mission. He has since served as the director of the space shuttle program and of the John F. Kennedy Space Center. Among his numerous awards is the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the nation's highest spaceflight award."
108054,"The only astronaut to have piloted four types of spacecraft—the Gemini, the Apollo Command Module, the Apollo Lunar Module, and the space shuttle—John Young enjoyed a long and productive career with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In addition to walking on the moon as commander of Apollo 16, Young helped inaugurate the nation’s space shuttle program, which featured a reusable spacecraft, and served as commander of the shuttle Columbia in April 1981. This life study of Young by portraitist Henry Casselli, a participant in NASA’s art program, features the astronaut in his “snoopy cap,” just prior to donning his helmet for Columbia’s maiden voyage. Shortly after the flight, Young was recognized for his service with the Congressional Space Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest spaceflight award. "
108345,"Born Pasadena, California    With the 1961 publication of her groundbreaking Mastering the Art of French Cooking (co-authored with Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle), Julia Child launched a highly successful effort to demystify French cuisine by enabling American cooks ""to create French dishes in American kitchens with American foods."" The book sold more than 100,000 copies in its first year and also provided the springboard to Child’s improbable career in television. In February 1962, just four months after her cookbook’s release, Child appeared on a local interview program on WGBH in Boston and matter-of-factly prepared a mushroom omelet. Viewers were enchanted, and letters poured in asking for more opportunities to see Child in action. The result was the debut, on July 26, 1962, of The French Chef—the half-hour cooking show on public television that would make Julia Child a household name and a culinary icon."

108441,"Born Kovno (now Kaunas), Lithuania    A charismatic labor and feminist activist, Emma Goldman advocated for “direct action, the open defiance of, and resistance to, all laws and restrictions, economic, social, and moral.” Emigrating from Russia in 1885, she worked in a Rochester, New York, sweatshop, an experience that inspired her to organize against those whom she perceived as exploitative. During the explosive 1890s, as anarchism and other forms of radicalism flourished, she led strikes, boycotts, and acts of civil disobedience, and was frequently arrested or harassed by authorities. In 1906 she and her lover and political partner Alexander Berkman founded Mother Earth, a monthly magazine devoted to various anarchist causes. During the Red Scare of 1919, American officials deported Goldman, and she spent much of the rest of her life living in exile in Europe. This photograph by California modernist Margrethe Mather was likely taken during one of Goldman’s frequent lecture tours."
108442,"Born New York City    In 1969 Felipe Luciano helped to found the New York chapter of the Young Lords, a political activist group that served as an important voice for the Puerto Rican community. A reformed gang member, Luciano—known during this period as ""the Magnet""—emerged as a charismatic orator. He led numerous demonstrations and initiated campaigns on behalf of New York’s Puerto Rican community. At this time he also began to deliver spoken-word performances and was a member of the Original Last Poets, a group of writers whose frequently improvisational compositions were rooted in street culture. In this 1970 photograph, the twenty-two-year-old Luciano stands before a brick wall in Harlem on which the motto ""Patria O Muerte"" (Nation or Death) has been written. He is still an active media personality and speaks to government and corporate leaders on issues affecting the Latino community."
108443,"Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. at a mass meeting during the Montgomery bus boycott  A little more than a year after King began his ministry in Montgomery, longtime resident Rosa Parks committed a courageous act of civil disobedience that culminated in one of the modern civil rights movement’s seminal victories. On December 1, 1955, Parks was arrested and jailed after refusing to surrender her seat on a public bus to a white male passenger. Four days later, when Parks was convicted of violating local segregation laws, Montgomery’s African American community staged a massive boycott of the city’s bus system. Planned as a one-day protest, the boycott expanded under the leadership of the newly formed Montgomery Improvement Association, which selected the twenty-six-year-old King as its president and spokesman.   In this image, Rosa Parks leans forward in her front-row seat as King, with his hand on the Bible and his back to the camera, prepares to speak from the pulpit."
108465,"Born Perth Amboy, New Jersey  William Dunlap is now best known as America’s first art historian. His History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States (1834) remains an essential account of early American culture and the arts. Dunlap studied art in London with Benjamin West, and while there he grew to love the theater. When he returned to America he pursued careers as both a dramatist and painter. This is one of three known miniature self-portraits of Dunlap and was likely created when he began to take commissions for miniatures, around 1805. "
108469,"Born El Paso, Texas  Best known for his powerful and colorful monumental fiberglass sculptures, Luis Jiménez created art that affirmed both Chicano and American types and history throughout his career. He spent most of his life in New Mexico after studying art and architecture at the University of Texas and launching his career in New York City. One of his most important sculptures, Man on Fire (1969), visually combines the story of the Aztec ruler Cuauhtémoc, tortured by fire by Spanish conquistadors, and the self-immolation of Buddhist monks protesting the Vietnam War. A transformative work, it is owned by the Smithsonian American Art Museum, which also displays another masterpiece, Vaquero (1980), at the entrance to the building on G Street. Charles Rushton photographed Jiménez as part of his series of portraits of New Mexico artists."
108529,"  ""I'm fascinated by boys who spend their lives trying to be complete girls, because they have to work so hard,"" Warhol wrote in The Philosophy of Andy Warhol. ""It's hard work to look like the complete opposite of what nature made you and then to be an imitation woman of what was only a fantasy woman in the first place."" Warhol collaborated with a makeup artist and his young assistant, Christopher Makos, to create this well-known portrait of himself in drag. The carefully contrived look recalls not so much a man behind a female mask but Marlene Dietrich's fashion statements of the 1930s. Here is a man dressed as a woman playing with male attributes-in other words, we have imitation piled upon imitation, with no real core or source. Warhol, who indeed always wore a wig, famously remarked, ""If you want to know all about Andy Warhol, just look at the surface of my paintings and films and me, and there I am. There's nothing behind it."""
108573,"Born Jefferson City, Missouri     In 1958 electrical engineer Jack Kilby revolutionized modern electronics by inventing “the monolithic integrated circuit,” commonly known as the microchip. Fascinated by electronics from childhood, Kilby had dreamed of studying at MIT. But when his scores on the school’s entrance exam fell short, he joined the army and served during World War II. He later earned degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin, with support from the G.I. Bill. Shortly after joining the staff of Texas Instruments in 1958, Kilby found a way to produce a tiny integrated circuit that eliminated the need for vast quantities of components that had to be joined to form elaborate circuits. When electronics manufacturers proved slow to adopt Kilby’s microchip technology, he demonstrated its commercial value by co-inventing the first handheld electric calculator. Kilby earned the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2000 for his integrated circuit and ultimately held more than sixty patents."
108638,"In the summer of 1840, farmer-turned-inventor William Howe was awarded two patents for what became known as the Howe truss bridge. One of the mid-nineteenth century's most important bridge designs, it was the first to combine a diagonal wooden truss structure with vertical iron ties. In 1841 the Western Railroad commissioned Howe to build a large bridge across the Connecticut River utilizing his patented truss design. This span proved so successful that Howe spent the remainder of his life constructing similar bridges throughout the country and earning a fortune in royalties by selling the rights to his patents."
108640,"Alfred Stieglitz's portrait of Marius de Zayas shows the Mexican-born artist in Stieglitz's 291 gallery in 1913. De Zayas was then exhibiting a selection of his abstract caricatures, two of which appear behind him. He began his artistic career as a newspaper illustrator in Mexico City; in 1907 the regime of Mexican president Porfirio Díaz forced him and his family to immigrate to the United States. In New York, de Zayas continued to contribute to newspapers while developing a close association with Stieglitz and others who championed modern art. Wanting to incorporate the lessons of modernism into the art of illustration, de Zayas experimented with the creative possibilities of abstract representation. He wrote extensively about modern art and curated exhibitions-first at Stieglitz's gallery and later, beginning in 1915, at two galleries of his own."
108708,"Booker T. Washington and Andrew Carnegie-both seated at center-encapsulate much of nineteenth-century America. Both were self-made men: Carnegie was an immigrant who built a manufacturing empire and amassed enormous wealth; Washington was a former slave who became an African American leader during one of the harshest periods of American race relations. Carnegie determined that the ultimate purpose of wealth was to improve society; Washington founded Tuskegee Institute to enable his people to make economic progress. Carnegie was one of Tuskegee's benefactors. Speaking at the school's twenty-fifth anniversary when this picture was taken, Carnegie praised Washington as the best ""climber"" the world has ever seen.

108710,"This photograph showing documentary film pioneer Pare Lorentz, at left, and cinematographer Paul Ivano, beside the camera at center, was made in 1936 near Bakersfield, California. There, Lorentz was at work on The Plow That Broke the Plains-his first film for the New Deal's Resettlement Administration. An ardent supporter of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lorentz was hired in 1935 to publicize the challenges that the nation's agricultural industry faced during the Great Depression. Through a skillful combination of visual elements, music, and commentary, he created a sympathetic portrait of the American farmer in his documentaries. His next film, The River (1937), focused attention on another New Deal initiative, the Tennessee Valley Authority. In response to the movies' critical success, Roosevelt established the U.S. Film Service. Lorentz revolutionized the way documentaries were used, positioning them as a medium for transmitting social and political messages."
109034,"With nine NBA championships and a win total of 938 games, ""Red"" Auerbach stands as the most successful professional basketball coach of all time. In 1950, after a stellar career as a college player and several years of professional coaching, Auerbach signed on as coach of the struggling Boston Celtics and set about transforming the team. He broke basketball's color line by drafting Chuck Cooper in 1950; and he developed the pattern of modern fast-break basketball that continues today. Under Auerbach's leadership, the Celtics emerged as a perennial power that would dominate the NBA well into the 1960s. In this image Auerbach talks with the Celtics' All-Star point guard and team anchor Bob Cousy during a practice session in 1957-the year that Cousy claimed the NBA's MVP award. It was also the year in which the Celtics established their title-winning dynasty by capturing the first of eleven NBA championships during a thirteen-year period."
109038,"Daniel Ellsberg  born 1931  Born Chicago, Illinois  Walter Cronkite  1916–2009  Born Saint Joseph, Missouri     Mild-mannered political scientist Daniel Ellsberg was at the heart of the contentious Pentagon Papers incident during the Vietnam War. Ellsberg worked for the Rand Corporation, a defense “think tank,” and for the Defense Department—service that included two years in Vietnam. In 1967 he began working on a Pentagon project compiling a secret history of the Vietnam War using classified documents. As he studied the war, Ellsberg became increasingly disillusioned with American foreign policy, and in an act of conscience he released the secret report to the New York Times in 1971. The government sought to suppress publication and the issue quickly became one of press freedom. It also sought to prosecute Ellsberg on charges of espionage; these were dismissed in a 1973 trial.  David Marlin’s photograph shows Ellsberg with the iconic American newsman Walter Cronkite, probably the most trusted public figure of his time. It was taken when Ellsberg was eluding capture by federal authorities while leaking the Pentagon Papers. "
109282,"Following Fort Donelson, Grant fought his first great set-piece battle at Shiloh, Tennessee (April 6–7 1862), a bloody encounter at which the Union only narrowly prevailed. Shiloh burnished Grant’s reputation for hard fighting, but the casualty list made many blanch. Grant was now known to Lincoln as a successful general, and the president defended him against personal and professional attacks. After Shiloh, Grant moved on Vicksburg, conducting one of the most difficult and protracted campaigns of the war. He finally took the city (in this eyewitness sketch Confederate general John Pemberton surrenders his troops) on July 4, 1863, after a siege of six months. Vicksburg was won on the same day as Gettysburg. In the West, the victory meant, as Lincoln put it grandiloquently, “The Father of Waters [the Mississippi] again goes unvexed to the sea.” And Grant would go to Washington to become general-in-chief of the Union armies, holding the rank of lieutenant general—a rank last held by George Washington.  Ulysses S. Grant y John Pemberton     Después de Fort Donelson, Grant luchó su primera gran batalla convencional en Shiloh, Tennessee (6–7 de abril de 1862), un encuentro sangriento en el que la Unión sólo se impuso por un estrecho margen. La batalla de Shiloh realzó la reputación de Grant para la lucha dura pero la lista de víctimas hizo a muchos palidecer. Grant era ahora reconocido por Lincoln como un general victorioso. El presidente lo defendió de ataques personales y profesionales. Después de Shiloh, Grant avanzó hacia Vicksburg y realizó una de las campañas más difíciles y prolongadas de la guerra. Finalmente tomó la ciudad (en este bosquejo de testigo presencial, el general confederado John Pemberton entrega sus tropas) el 4 de julio de 1863, tras un asedio de seis meses.  Venció en Vicksburg el mismo día que en Gettysburg. En el occidente, la victoria significaba, como Lincoln dijo con grandilocuencia, “el padre de las aguas [el Mississippi] torna invicto al mar”. Y Grant fue a Washington para convertirse en general en jefe de los ejércitos de la Unión con el rango de teniente general. Este rango lo tuvo anteriormente George Washington.     Frederick B.

109288,"Born Westmoreland County, Virginia    Thomas Gimbrede's engraving served as the principal presidential image of James Monroe, becoming the most widely disseminated image  during Monroe's years in office. Artist John Vanderlyn commissioned the print, based on his own painted portrait, in the spring of 1816, when he learned of Monroe's presidential aspirations. The engraving began circulating just after the president's inauguration in March of 1817. Vanderlyn, a houseguest and close friend of the then-secretary of state, had recently finished painting two almost identical portraits of Monroe. James Madison had commissioned the original, which pleased Monroe enough to request another for himself. From Monroe's version, now owned by the National Portrait Gallery, Vanderlyn made a quick sketch to function as the engraver's model. Guided by this drawing, Gimbrede offered the first engraved image of the fifth president in this print."
109291,"Born Campbell’s Station, Tennessee  John Chester Buttre’s engraving celebrates the military exploits of the Union naval hero David G. Farragut. Although Farragut went to sea at an early age and learned to speak French, Italian, Spanish, and Arabic, his promotion was relatively slow. This was related in part to his determination to personally care for his ailing first wife, who passed away in 1840. During the Civil War, Farragut’s boldness and courage led to key victories at Mobile Bay and New Orleans, recognized in this work. In 1866 Congress appointed Farragut a full admiral, a rank established to honor his achievements. Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles later praised Farragut as possessing “innate fearless moral courage.” Welles noted that although he did “but one thing at a time, [he] does that well and strong.”"
109292,"Born Newsoms, Virginia     From the start of his successful military career, doubt seemed to hover over George H. Thomas like a long, dark shadow. Before entering West Point, his sponsoring congressman warned him that no former student from his district in southern Virginia had ever graduated. Thomas graduated twelfth in a class of forty-two. At the start of the Civil War, Thomas’s Virginia kinfolk disowned him for his steadfast loyalty to the Union. That loyalty was also initially viewed with suspicion among his Yankee peers. Thomas, however, quickly proved to be an accomplished commander and general, as this print suggests; the vignettes in the four corners commemorate his contributions in the battles of Mill Spring, Murfreesboro (Stones River), Chickamauga, and Nashville. Yet even after the war, Thomas still had critics right up until his death; he was writing a defense of his Civil War service in a rebuttal to a rival officer when he suffered a fatal stroke in 1870.

109293,"Illustrated news publications  At the start of the Civil War, the major illustrated news publications—Harper’s Weekly, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper, and the New York Illustrated News—were all northern enterprises engaged in telling their side of the war. The South had no comparable news organ until September 1862, when E. W. Ayres and W. H. Wade of Richmond began publishing the Southern Illustrated News. Because paper, ink, and printing presses were just a few of the South’s many scarcities, editors scrambled to produce weekly editions of the paper. Foremost was the challenge of finding good engravers to carve the illustrations into blocks of wood, which were then inked and printed on paper. The news pages on display here represent the papers of Ayres and Wade, and Frank Leslie.    General James Longstreet in the Southern Illustrated News, February 6, 1864"
109295,"Born Clarksburg, Virginia (now West Virginia)  This c. 1863 lithograph by the New York–based firm of Currier & Ives testifies to the fame of Confederate general Thomas Jonathan “Stonewall” Jackson. The likeness is based on the last photograph of him, taken by Virginia photographer George W. Minnis just a few days before Jackson’s death at the Battle of Chancellorsville.              Despite humble beginnings, Jackson attended West Point, graduating seventeenth in a class of fifty-nine, and later demonstrated his extraordinary resolve on the battlefield. After success in the Mexican American War, Jackson became an instructor at the Virginia Military Institute, from which he led cadets into war in 1861. Jackson, who earned his nickname during the First Battle of Bull Run, became one of the South’s most successful military tacticians. Setting an example that would lead to an early southern victory, Jackson’s fellow general Barnard E. Bee is reported to have exclaimed: “Look, men! There stands Jackson like a stone wall! Rally behind the Virginians!”"
109321,"Born Devonshire, England    British explorer Sir Walter Raleigh is remembered in American history for the English colony he attempted to establish on Roanoke Island on the coast of North Carolina in 1584, a venture that earned him a knighthood.After his initial expedition returned to England, Raleigh sent a second colony to Roanoke in 1587. The disappearance of this colony between 1587 and 1590 remains one of the great mysteries of American colonial history.   This portrait was circulated on its own  and then printed on the title page of several editions of Raleigh's immensely popular book The Historie of the World. Formerly a court favorite, Raleigh wrote his book-which details time from the Creation through the second century BC-during his imprisonment in the Tower of London. The print, which first appeared in a 1617 edition, was the only engraving of him published in his lifetime. "
109344,"Born Woburn, Massachusetts    Some of the innovations that physicist and social reformer Benjamin Thompson advanced, including coffee percolators, double boilers, and fireplace and chimney improvements, are still evident today. Thompson focused on the practical application of his inventions. His development of inexpensive, nutritious meals and more efficient stoves, lamps, and indoor heating were credited with saving and improving lives. Denied a commission in the colonial army, Thompson joined the British army in 1775. He traveled to England and the Continent, ingratiating himself with the Elector of Bavaria, who made him a count of the Holy Roman Empire.    The English engraver of this mezzotint, John Raphael Smith, who also painted the original portrait, proudly identified himself as ""mezzotinto engraver to H.R.H. the Prince of Wales."" Unusually versatile, Smith worked as a miniaturist, pastel artist, publisher, and print-seller with an active export trade.   "
109406,"Born Stockton, California    The daughter of parents who emigrated from China, writer Maxine Hong Kingston was the first of their eight children to be born in the United States. Her works, both fiction and nonfiction, focus on the experience of immigration and the continual sense of being tugged between two worlds. After her marriage and a stint as a high-school teacher, Kingston began writing full-time around 1967 and published the Woman Warrior: Memoir of a Girlhood among Ghosts in 1976. Although a novel, it won the National Book Critics Circle Award for nonfiction because of its mixture of fact and fiction, as well as its autobiographical elements. Kingston subsequently won the National Book Award for China Men (1980). She cites Walt Whitman as a particular influence, both for his style and for the breadth of his vision of an America that celebrates the multiplicity of experience and the possibilities of identity."
109408,"Playwright Horton Foote once remarked, ""I don't really write to honor the past. I write to investigate, to try to figure out what happened and why it happened, knowing I'll never really know."" The author of more than sixty plays, many of which are set in a small town not unlike the one in Texas in which he was raised, Foote was especially interested in themes surrounding family and home. At age sixteen, he left home to pursue an acting career in California, although he later discovered that his true talent was as a writer. Foote found success in the 1950s writing television dramas, but his wider achievements came in film and theater. He won Oscars for his adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird (1962) and his original screenplay Tender Mercies (1983), and in 1995 he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for The Young Man from Atlanta. Keith Carter portrays Foote here  in his Texas home. "
109476,"The biggest advantage and the biggest handicap I have, George W. Bush frankly admitted, ""is my name."" The grandson of a United States senator and the eldest son of a president, Bush was a popular governor of Texas who worked successfully with both Republicans and Democrats. In 2000, in an election so close that it required the intervention of the Supreme Court, Bush defeated Al Gore, the vice president during the previous administration. Expecting that the success of his presidency would hinge, as it had when he was governor, on his negotiating skills and ability to solve problems, Bush found his two terms in office instead marked by a series of cataclysmic events: the attacks on September 11, 2001; the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq; the devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina; and a financial crisis during his last months in office.   The White House selected Robert Anderson, a Connecticut portraitist and a Yale classmate of the president, to create this painting for the National Portrait Gallery. "
109698,"In the first rank of American composers, Duke Ellington was ""beyond category"": his more than 2,000 jazz compositions include ""Satin Doll"" and ""Sophisticated Lady,"" as well as Black, Brown and Beige and the later ""Sacred Concerts."" Legendary performer Tony Bennett (born Anthony Benedetto), who has had a lifelong interest in painting, here portrays the man he celebrated as his mentor. ""When I worked on his portrait, I was inspired by the look of divine serenity on his face,"" Bennett noted, and he inscribed the painting, ""God Is Love."" Whenever Ellington completed a new piece, he sent Bennett roses to mark the occasion, and their presence here reflects the close bond the two artists shared."
109700,"Forty-fourth president     Shepard Fairey’s Barack Obama Hope poster became the iconic campaign image for the first African American president of the United States. Early in 2008, the Los Angeles–based graphic designer and street artist designed his first Obama portraits, with a stenciled face, visionary upward glance, and inspiring captions. The artist’s intention that the image be widely reproduced and ""go viral"" on the Internet exceeded his greatest expectations. Campaign supporters and grassroots organizations disseminated tens of thousands of T-shirts, posters, and small stickers; Fairey himself produced mural-sized versions; and a free, downloadable graphic generated countless more repetitions. In this fine-art version of that unprecedented and powerful campaign icon, Fairey incorporated the familiar heroic pose and patriotic color scheme. But he translated the portrait into a collage with a rich, elegant surface of decorative papers and old newsprint."
109745,"  In the early part of the twentieth century, tenor Enrico Caruso (standing at right) was the most acclaimed singer in the world. He made his American debut in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in November 1903, and soon after signed a contract to record exclusively for the Victor Company and its affiliates. As Caruso's phenomenal appeal fueled the demand for his recordings and for the machines that could play them, phonographs made the rapid transition from novelty item to household fixture. In 1914 Caruso joined the singers pictured here-Frieda Hempel, Maria Duchêne, Guilio Setti, Léon Rothier, and Andrés de Segurola-to perform a selection from Verdi's Un ballo in maschera for a recording issued in 1915. Although this image may have been used to publicize that record, it was more likely intended to promote the sale of Victrola phonographs such as the model pictured here."
109873,"Born Lake George, New York  Published in the first issue of the Photographic Art Journal, an early journal of photography, Francis D’Avignon’s lithographic portrait celebrates pioneering photographer Mathew Brady. The lithograph accompanied an article about Brady by C. Edwards Lester that praised the young daguerreotypist, who specialized in creating portraits. Lester’s essay celebrates Brady’s groundbreaking Gallery of Illustrious Americans, inaugurated a year before this portrait was made and featuring photographic images of politicians, military generals, and men of letters. Although the ambitious project, which featured lithographs by D’Avignon based on photographs by Brady, was not a financial success, Lester noted that “before the Daguerrean art was discovered, it is useless to say that it was within the power of any publisher in the world, or any artist in the world, to execute such faithful, life-like, and strikingly beautiful portraits of our public men.”   "
109935,"Despite its reputation for progressive politics, Hollywood has been surprisingly skittish when it comes to publicly acknowledging sexual difference. Thus it was a landmark event when in April 1997, the sitcom star and talk show host Ellen DeGeneres (born 1958) told Time magazine, ""Yep I'm Gay."" DeGeneres debated coming out but ultimately decided that not openly acknowledging her lesbianism meant that she lacked control over her own life and career. Coming out, she said afterward, has been the most freeing experience because ""people can't hurt me anymore."" Annie Leibovitz's photograph presents a carnival of visual signs that highlight the ambiguities with which DeGeneres presented herself in public and on her television shows. Amid the madcap mugging in the photograph, notice the aggressive presentation of the breasts versus the exposed boxer shorts. DeGeneres's mimelike mask both reveals and hides, and the cigarette gives her a tough-guy look."
110052,"In 1917, Harold Hart Crane fled his parents’ disintegrating household in Ohio for New York City, where he attempted to find work and create an artistic life for himself. In New York he met a twenty-seven-year-old artist/intellectual named Carl Schmitt, who took Crane under his wing. Schmitt was Crane’s tutor in modernism, and he played an essential role in Crane’s transition from an unformed aspiring midwestern writer to the most ecstatic American poet of the city since Walt Whitman. Crane’s great book-length poem The Bridge (1930)—named after the Brooklyn Bridge—took seven years to write and is packed with the sense that the poet was nearly overwhelmed by the romance of modern life. Crane reveled in the manic energy of the city in all its aspects: from the din of construction to the promise of late-night sexual encounters. Crane swallowed the city whole, giving back in his incantory verse a sense of the possibilities and varieties of human experience. It couldn’t last. Still young, Crane came down with a terrible case of writer’s block and, in despair, committed suicide at age thirty-three. In this group of images, Carl Schmitt’s later portrait  of his young protégé is fogged, indistinct, and mysterious—suggesting the ultimate mysteriousness of Crane’s personality that led him to his tragically early death."
110097,"Telegraphed reports of Ellsworth's death caused a sensation throughout the North: church and fire bells tolled, and flags flew at half-mast from Poughkeepsie to Pittsburgh and beyond. Lincoln was deeply distressed. Ellsworth had been particularly close to the Lincoln family in the last months of his life, and when his body was brought to the Washington Navy Yard, the president and first lady wept. Lincoln arranged for Ellsworth to lie in state in the East Room of the White House the next day, May 25. Mrs. Lincoln made a floral wreath with Ellsworth's picture in the center and placed it on his casket. That afternoon a military escort, including Francis Brownell carrying the Marshall House flag, paraded solemnly to the train station. Ellsworth would be interred in his hometown of Mechanicville, New York. "
110098,"Early in the morning of May 24, 1861, the day after Virginians voted to secede from the Union, several thousand Northern troops crossed into Virginia from Washington to occupy Alexandria and its environs. As the commander of the New York Fire Zouaves, Colonel Ellsworth ferried his regiment across the Potomac River and reached the city wharf at dawn. Upon seeing a large Confederate flag flying over the Marshall House on King Street, Ellsworth hastened  to the hotel with a small detail of men and made his way to the rooftop, where he commandeered the flag. He was descending the staircase with his men while rolling up the prize banner when the innkeeper, James W. Jackson, emerged from the shadows and fired a double-barreled shotgun at Ellsworth, killing him instantly. Jackson was himself fatally shot and bayoneted to death by Corporal Francis E. Brownell.   "
110309,"Born Nantucket, Massachusetts    Lucretia Mott's commitment to ending slavery and securing rights for women became the defining features of her life. A devout Quaker whose activism proved unsettling to some members of her faith, Mott assumed a highly visible role in the abolitionist movement. After joining William Lloyd Garrison at the launch of the American Anti-Slavery Society in 1833, she helped to found Philadelphia's Female Anti-Slavery Society. Her concern for women's rights was a natural outgrowth of her abolitionist efforts, and in 1848 Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton organized the convention at Seneca Falls, New York, that gave birth to the women's suffrage movement. "
110311,"Born Abbott, Texas    A prolific songwriter and nonstop performer, musician Willie Nelson has managed to remain vital and creative for nearly fifty years. Constantly adapting to new musical tastes and influences as his career has progressed, Nelson has evolved from his roots in straight country music in the 1950s, assimilated rock and roll to create the Outlaw Revolution of the 1970s, and currently maintains his role as the pater familias of American popular music. Nelson even produced a bestselling album of jazz ballads with Stardust (1978). His songwriting credits include ""Funny How Time Slips Away,"" ""Hello Walls,"" and ""Crazy."" Nelson has been active in the reform of marijuana laws and in Farm Aid, and has also had serious problems with the IRS, which finally seem to have been reconciled. Despite his advocacy of and copious use of marijuana, he is a dedicated long-distance runner and has become an American icon."
110312,"Willie Nelson has ranged more widely than any country singer of his generation. While he got his start writing songs for others—including ""Crazy"" (1961), first popularized by Patsy Cline—he broke from the string-dominated Nashville sound with the release of his breakthrough album Red Headed Stranger in 1975. Jazz, blues, pop, swing, and folk all became a part of the ""outlaw"" country music that he and others popularized during this period. Wearing long hair, a red bandana, and denim and singing in a distinctive weathered voice, Nelson is a gentle and unassuming presence on stage. Yet his tenderness is rooted in a flinty toughness built on irreverence toward authority. This independent streak reveals itself both in his songs and in his work as the founder of the Farm Aid concert series, as a champion of biodiesel fuel, and as a tireless advocate for the legalization of marijuana."
110313,"Born Archer City, Texas    The western is one of American literature's oldest genres, constantly revived and renewed even when it seems to be becoming dated and near extinction. One of the most distinctive American writers, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Lonesome Dove (1985) Larry McMurtry, has been a major voice in creating the modern western. Among his best-known works are Horseman Pass By (1961; adapted to the screen as Hud), The Last Picture Show (1966), Terms of Endearment (1975), and Crazy Horse (1999). He also has been active in organizations such as PEN that support the cause of arts and letters. As well as being an incredibly prolific author, McMurtry has been active as a screenwriter for both the film adaptations of his own books and those of others; he won an Academy Award for adapted screenplay for Brokeback Mountain, which was based on a story by Annie Proulx.   "
110315,"One of the best-selling golf books ever published, Harvey Penick's Little Red Book: Lessons and Teachings from a Lifetime of Golf, resulted from a fruitful collaboration between golfer Penick and writer Edwin ""Bud"" Shrake. Combining life lessons, golf tips, and autobiography, the Little Red Book showcased Penick's extensive knowledge of the game, delivering tips on stance and swing as well as observations about integrity and character. Penick spent almost fifty years  as the head golf professional at the Austin Country Club and coached the University of Texas golf team for thirty-two years; his students included successful professionals such as Babe Didrikson, Tom Kite, and Ben Crenshaw. Shrake worked as a journalist and spent several years writing for Sports Illustrated. On assignment for Texas Monthly, Michael O'Brien photographed the pair for an article celebrating the publication of their second book.   "
110316,"During the American Revolution lawyer Caleb Strong served on the Northampton Committee of Safety and helped draft the Massachusetts Constitution of 1780. Strong attended the Constitutional Convention, supporting the Constitution’s adoption and ratification. He served in the Senate from 1789 to 1796, supporting Federalist policies. In 1801, Strong was elected governor of Massachusetts, counseling moderation to those vociferously opposed to President-elect Thomas Jefferson, reminding fellow Federalists ""that in a republic the majority must prevail."" Returning to the governorship in 1812, he did not heed his own advice and refused to put the state’s militia at the disposal of the federal government. Evidence suggests that Strong may have participated in a plot to separate New England from the United States by sending an agent to Halifax in 1814 to enter into talks ""of a very delicate nature"" with Lieutenant Governor Sir John Sherbrooke. "
110392,"As photography evolved, attempts were made to make the images more lifelike. An early solution was the stereograph, which consisted of two nearly identical photographs affixed side by side. Viewed through the lens of a stereoscope, of which this is a modern recreation, the two photographs meld to appear as a single three-dimensional image. Viewing stereographs was a common pastime for middle-class households and was regarded as having both educational and entertainment value. Photographers created thousands of views of historic landmarks, natural wonders, and people from many backgrounds. Gardner’s stereoscopic views of the battlefields heightened their emotional charge, as the viewer seems to be moving through the landscape itself."
110435,"Born Chicago, Illinois     Playfully titling this screenprint of the nation’s first African American first lady Michelle O, Mickalene Thomas creates an implicit comparison between Michelle Obama’s youthful, fashion-forward glamour and that of Jacqueline Kennedy. In addition to the extraordinary support she has lent to her husband’s political career, Michelle Obama—here depicted as personable, confident, and forthright—is herself a Harvard-trained lawyer. Prior to her husband’s election, she demonstrated her own impressive legal and administrative skills, building an influential career in Chicago devoted largely to stimulating and supporting public service. As first lady, Obama has continued to stress the importance of social issues and has put special focus on the challenge of eradicating childhood obesity through healthy eating and exercise. In her husband’s second term, she has launched new initiatives to urge Americans to continue their education beyond high school and to support service members, veterans, and their families.    Michelle O  Michelle Obama  nacida en 1964  Nacida en Chicago, Illinois     Mickalene Thomas ha titulado con humor Michelle O esta serigrafía de la primera afroamericana que ocupa el puesto de primera dama del país, con lo cual implica una comparación entre el glamour joven y vanguardista de Michelle Obama y el de Jacqueline Kennedy. Además de su extraordinario apoyo a la carrera política de su esposo, Michelle Obama (quien aquí se proyecta amable, segura y directa) es una abogada graduada de Harvard. Antes de la elección de su esposo, dejó demostradas sus notables destrezas legales y administrativas con una influyente carrera en Chicago, dedicada sobre todo a fomentar y respaldar el servicio público. Como primera dama, Obama ha seguido enfatizando la importancia de las causas sociales, con atención especial al reto de erradicar la obesidad infantil mediante hábitos alimenticios sanos y ejercicio. Durante el segundo término de su esposo ha lanzado nuevas iniciativas para exhortar a los estadounidenses a continuar sus estudios más allá de la escuela superior y a respaldar a los miembros del ejército, los veteranos y sus familiares.     Mickalene Thomas (nacida en 1971)   Serigrafía, 2008  Donación de Kenneth I. Schaner "
110436,"Born Galesburg, Illinois    As a poet and author who championed the everyman, Carl Sandburg earned great acclaim and won the Pulitzer Prize for Cornhuskers, Complete Poems, and Abraham Lincoln: The War Years. Sandburg's own life, an odyssey of the American experience, included time as a hobo, door-to-door salesman, and other odd jobs. At the time this portrait was made, Sandburg defined personal happiness as ""To be out of jail. To eat and sleep regular. To get what I write printed in a free country for free people. To have a little love in the home and a little affection and esteem outside the home.""   Thomas Hart Benton's drawing of his friend, although dated 1957, appears to be a study for his 1956 oil painting. Benton's characteristic style infuses energy into Sandburg's likeness, bringing together two twentieth-century artists who celebrated the ordinary American."
110437,"Born Nashville, Tennessee    In his highly energized self-portrait, Red Grooms gives us a tangible sense of something rarely depicted visually: the intellectual life of the artist. Grooms, one of a number of American artists at midcentury who helped to reestablish the figure as a subject for art, made his name with a zany, unorthodox take on representation. His paintings, prints, sculptures, and films mined a vein of comic mania hard to reconcile with cool pop art and minimalist trends. Grooms's crowd-pleasing whimsies caused one art historian to describe him as a ""latter-day P. T. Barnum or Walt Disney, albeit crossed with Marcel Duchamp."" Surrounding him are his visualized embodiments of people whose biographies he has recently read; Thomas Edison, Mark Twain, P. T. Barnum, and the nineteenth-century clown Dan Rice all haunt his memory. "
110443,"Born New Orleans, Louisiana     Jazz trumpeter and singer Louis Armstrong was also known as “Satchmo” or “Pops.” His first formal music lessons took place at the Colored Waifs’ Home in New Orleans, where Armstrong was detained as a juvenile delinquent for firing a pistol on New Year’s Eve. After his release about eighteen months later, he pursued a career as a musician. Playing with pick-up bands and in small clubs, Armstrong, his mentor Joe “King” Oliver, Jelly Roll Morton, Sidney Bechet, and others began creating new band music out of blues and ragtime. In the 1920s, as Armstrong left New Orleans for Chicago and New York City, his popularity exploded. He wowed audiences with groundbreaking trumpet solos, improvisations, and his “scat” singing.  This portrait shows the young Armstrong with his instrument. The reverse side lists Armstrong’s popular recordings from 1927 and 1928, including “West End Blues.”   "
110445,"Born Mobile, Alabama  A legendary hitter who set records that remain unequaled to this day, Hank Aaron was one of baseball’s greatest offensive stars. Other players may have been more flamboyant, but none could match Aaron’s power and consistency during his twenty-three years in the majors. After launching his career with the Negro League’s Indianapolis Clowns in 1952, Aaron signed with the Boston Braves. His debut with the franchise came in 1954, following its move to Milwaukee. Aaron soon emerged as a tremendous asset to the ball club, and in 1957 his bat drove the Braves to a World Series victory over the Yankees. In the years that followed, Aaron’s impressive hitting fueled his assault on the record books, and in 1974 he became the first player to break Babe Ruth’s career record of 714 home runs. When Aaron retired from play in 1976, his home run mark stood at 755."
110447,"Born Level Cross, North Carolina  Known simply as ""The King,"" Richard Petty is the most important figure in the history of American stock car racing (NASCAR). Petty was a seven-time champion and won exactly two hundred races in a career that spanned 1,184 events and thirty-five years. He won the Daytona 500, the sport’s hallmark event, seven times. The son of Lee Petty, himself a successful driver in the sport’s early days, Petty was instrumental in taking NASCAR from its outlaw origins—it derived from the South’s moonshine culture—and making it into a nationally important sport, attractive to advertisers, television, and big business, as well as the die-hard fan. Petty was a brilliant driver, but he achieved cult status because his devil-may-care personality hints at the sport’s rebellious self-image. He set the standard for fan friendliness that has become a hallmark of NASCAR’s appeal and marketing ventures. "
110449,"Born Brookline, Massachusetts     Eunice Kennedy Shriver was the creative force and organizer of Special Olympics, Inc., a nonprofit charitable organization that provides training and competition in Olympic sports for children and adults with intellectual disabilities. In 1957 Shriver became director of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation, which was created to deal with issues of mental retardation, and several years later she established a summer day camp at her home that became the basis for Special Olympics. In 1968 the Kennedy Foundation, working with the Chicago Park District, organized the First International Special Olympics Summer Games. Currently more than 1.3 million children and adults from more than 150 countries participate in the program.   David Lenz was commissioned to paint this portrait as part of the first prize in NPG's inaugural Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition. Lenz embraced the idea of making a portrait of Eunice Shriver that would also include five persons with intellectual disabilities who have been involved in Special Olympics and in the Best Buddies program: (left to right) Airika Straka, Katie Meade, Andy Leonard, Loretta Claiborne, and Marty Sheets."
110450,"Born St. Louis, Missouri    Founder of New York magazine in 1968, editor Clay Felker was a transformative figure in print media. He began his career at magazines such as Life and Esquire before revamping a supplement of the New York Herald Tribune into a stand-alone magazine. Felker described New York, the first magazine devoted to covering a city, as documenting ""how the power game is played, and who are the winners."" A gregarious ""sponge to the city,"" he counted writers Tom Wolfe and Gloria Steinem among his staff. Felker set the standard for ""New Journalism,"" which used long, narrative articles written with novelistic techniques to give reporting a hip voice.   The artist of this work, Byron Dobell, was also a respected magazine editor in New York. In 1994 Gail Sheehy commissioned him to paint this intimate portrait of her husband, posed in the living room of their New York City apartment."
110454,"Born Hope, Arkansas  This drawing of President Bill Clinton was created by R. B. Kitaj—an American artist long resident in England—as a study for a pastel portrait commissioned by University College, Oxford. Clinton is an honorary fellow of the college, having been a Rhodes Scholar there from 1968 to 1970. Kitaj made multiple sketches of the president during a one-hour sitting at the White House in 1995. The resulting work evokes a long tradition of depicting leaders in profile. Creating a likeness more thought-provoking than blindly complimentary, the artist has written, “I think we remember people by their faces. If you say or hear someone’s name, you think the face don’t you? . . . I think of the face first, and then other things. . . . I think all painted or drawn faces are more stylized, more abstracted (from life), more realized, and more ambiguous than faces in photographs.”"
110456,"Robert Duncan was a post–World War II poet who lived and worked mostly on the West Coast, where he was associated with both the Beat movement and the so-called ""Bay Area Renaissance."" His adoptive parents were theosophists, and he was raised in a household that put a heavy emphasis on the occult and mysterious. This upbringing may have influenced his tendency toward avant-garde surrealism in his verse. Duncan was the mentor of many emerging poets, such as Jack Spicer. During the 1960s he surfaced as a major post-Beat poet by publishing three important books in quick succession and then vowed to avoid the ""distraction"" of publishing. For fifteen years he kept the promise, not publishing his prizewinning Ground Work I until 1984. Duncan had a long-term relationship with the artist Jess Collins and was an important figure in the pre-Stonewall (1969) gay community. "
110468,"Born Nagasaki, Japan  Born to a Japanese mother and a German father, Sadakichi Hartmann began his career as a freelance art critic in the 1890s. Famous for his bohemian lifestyle, he became one of America’s few recognized authorities on Japanese culture following the publication of his book, Japanese Art, in 1904. In his 1910 book on artist James McNeill Whistler, he anticipated in many ways the modernist directions that contemporary painting would shortly take. Among Hartmann’s most significant contributions to art criticism were his writings on photography. Between 1896 and 1916, he penned more than 650 articles on the subject.              This 1898 photograph was created in New York City by Zaida Ben-Yusuf, a female photographer whose work Hartmann championed. About her, he wrote, “it is doubtful if there is in the entire United States a more interesting exponent of portrait photography than she is.”   "
110473,"Born Cleveland, Ohio    After attending Harvard, Philip Johnson traveled in Europe, where he met with architects and absorbed their ideas. Back in the United States, he created an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, ""The International Style"" (1932), which introduced modern architecture to the American public. Later, he designed a series of masterpieces, including his own residence, the Glass House (1949), and the Seagram Building in New York City, with Mies van der Rohe (1956).   His portrait was commissioned by a friend, who asked classically trained sculptor George M. Kelly to create this shimmering likeness, with Johnson's signature black glasses cast separately in bronze. It was displayed in the Glass House until Johnson's death."
110503,"Forty-third President, 2001-9    In 2004, for the second time in four years, Time named George W. Bush Person of the Year. Both occasions followed national elections in which Bush prevailed. The issue in 2000 was the disputed election itself, which Time predicted would be the subject of debate in political science classes for years to come. The major question looming during Bush's reelection campaign was the war in Iraq: Was America more secure? Could the Iraqi people embrace liberty and democracy as peaceful paths to coexistence? In spite of polls showing many Americans to be pessimistic, Bush was emboldened by both the war and the recent election. In contrast with the 2000 election, he now felt as if he had a mandate: ""I've got the will of the people at my back,"" he claimed after his victory.    Time cover, December 27, 2004"
110510,"Born Portsmouth, Virginia    With a voice said to rival that of Italian diva Adelina Patti, soprano Sissieretta Jones became an international star whose repertoire ranged from grand opera arias to popular ballads. A classically trained singer, Jones made her New York City debut at Steinway Hall in April 1888. After an admiring critic dubbed her ""the Black Patti,"" she was promoted as such for the remainder of her career. Touring extensively from 1888 until 1896, Jones delighted audiences at home and abroad with solo recitals as well as performances with a variety of musical ensembles. Although her venues included opera houses and concert halls, racial barriers prevented Jones from performing fully realized operatic roles. In 1896, she took her career in a new direction by forming Black Patti's Troubadours, a touring troupe of African American entertainers whose vaudevillian offerings were paired with ""operatic kaleidoscopes"" showcasing Jones's extraordinary vocal gifts.  "
110511,"Born Holly Springs, Mississippi      The daughter of former slaves, Ida B. Wells sued the Chesapeake, Ohio, and Southwestern Railway in 1883 after being dragged from her seat for refusing to move to a segregated railcar. Her anger over this incident spurred her to begin contributing articles to black-owned newspapers; she became part owner and editor of the Memphis Free Speech and Headlight in 1889. After three black businessmen were lynched in Memphis in 1892, Wells launched what became a four-decade-long anti-lynching crusade. She vigorously investigated other lynchings and published her groundbreaking treatise on the topic, Southern Horrors: Lynch Law in All Its Phases"
110512,"Every normal man must be tempted, at times, to spit on his hands, hoist the black flag, and begin slitting throats, wrote Henry Louis Mencken. Known as the ""Disturber of the Peace"" and the ""Great Iconoclast,"" Mencken attacked the complacency and sentimentality that he perceived in American society. As the coeditor of Smart Set and the founding editor of American Mercury, he established himself in the 1920s as the most powerful and original force in American literary and social criticism. Mencken’s writing style was as irreverent and outrageous as the opinions he espoused. Both loved and hated, he railed against frauds and American puritanism, which he defined as ""the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy."" Similarly, he rejected the genteel pretensions of Victorian writers, championing instead a more wide-ranging American vernacular. This photograph by Edward Steichen was published in Vanity Fair in 1927 alongside a caption that described Mencken as ""commander-in-chief of militant public opinion in America."""
110609,"Born Monroe, Washington    In this self-portrait, Chuck Close collaborated with master printer David Lasry to produce an anamorphosis, a trick of distortion dating back to the Renaissance that challenges traditional linear perspective. The portrait is unrecognizable from a viewpoint in front of the picture; the stretched-out image can only be ""read"" from the reflection in a cylindrical mirror. Anamorphic technology has been used to correct astigmatisms in ophthalmology, to film wide-screen motion pictures, and to adjust the distortions of aerial reconnaissance photography. Contemporary artists have used it for conceptual reasons: to question the meaning of perception and the authority of the frontal gaze.    "
110629,"Born West Troy, New York    In the early hours of April 17, 1860, American boxing champion John C. Heenan met British titleholder Tom Sayers in a bare-knuckle bout to decide the international heavyweight championship. Staged in the outskirts of London in defiance of a British boxing ban, the punishing match lasted for forty-two rounds, ending only after unruly spectators surged into the ring, making the continuation of the fight impossible. When the contest was later ruled a draw, each side proclaimed its man the victor.   These portraits of Heenan and Sayers were produced to satisfy popular demand for images of the boxers whose battle generated enormous interest on both sides of the Atlantic. While the English champion's photograph was issued before the contest, the American challenger's picture was made slightly more than two weeks after the fight. Heenan's size and weight advantage is evident in these photographs, in which each man poses bare-chested in boxing attire."

110677,"Born New York City    In April 1791, Elizabeth ""Betsy"" DePeyster, the daughter of a New York City merchant, travelled to Philadelphia where she met Charles Willson Peale, an American portrait painter. Peale, a widower, was searching for a new wife and a mother for his six children. Upon observing the ""serious motherly appearance"" of Betsy, then twenty-six, Peale knew he had found the right woman. On May 23, after a brief courtship and secret engagement, Betsy's father blessed their union. "
110812,"In this playful group portrait painted in Washington, D.C., Sarah Weston Seaton's (1789-1863) son Augustine (1810-1835) holds a bunch of cherries just beyond the reach of his sister Julia (1812-1889). The book in his right hand makes his purpose clear: The Art of Teasing Mad[e] Easy Washing[ton] 18- . Sarah's husband, William Seaton, and her brother, Joseph Gales Jr., were co-owners of the National Intelligencer. Under their editorship, this important newspaper covered congressional proceedings and was the official printer for Congress. The Seatons, whose home was on E Street, NW, between Seventh and Eighth Streets, played leading roles in Washington's political and cultural affairs. Charles Bird King, whose studio was at Twelfth and F Streets, was one of Washington's major portrait painters, best known for his portraits of members of the tribal delegations that visited Washington in the 1820s and 1830s."
110823,"Since 1981, Judith Martin (born 1938)-known to all newspaper-reading Americans who care about proper etiquette as ""Miss Manners""-and her husband, Robert, have traveled to Venice for extended stays several times a year. The gregarious Martins quickly made friends, among them Englishman Victor Edelstein and his Italian-born wife, artist Anna Maria Succi. Edelstein's initial career was as a couturier. Among his designs is the blue-velvet evening gown that Princess Diana wore to a White House dinner in 1985, the night she danced with John Travolta. Robert Martin commissioned Edelstein to paint his wife's portrait as a present for a forthcoming birthday. The numerous sittings took place over several years in the historic Palazzo Albrizzi. Edelstein selected the costume from among the clothes Martin owned. The books are two that  Martin authored. The model of the vaporetto was made by a well-known Venetian craftsman. "
110863,"Born Patrick County, Virginia  J.E.B. Stuart appears in this engraving, based on a photograph of 1863, as he looked when he commanded the cavalry in Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia. Lee relied heavily on Stuart’s ability to gather intelligence about the enemy’s strengths and whereabouts and to screen his own army’s movements. Stuart’s cavalry tactics became legendary, and success drove him to new and daring feats. During the Gettysburg campaign, Stuart’s overly ambitious reconnaissance put him out of communication with the main army at what proved to be a critical moment. Afterward, he never let down his vigilance or gave his commander cause for concern again. In May 1864, Stuart died from wounds suffered in a clash with Union forces at Yellow Tavern, near Richmond."
111014,"Born Jersey City, New Jersey    Inspired by the upscale catering business she launched from her Westport, Connecticut, home in 1976, Martha Stewart developed a multimedia lifestyle empire that has made her one the most successful businesswomen in American history. Stewart's first book, the runaway bestseller Entertaining (1982), spawned a series of lavishly illustrated volumes that fueled the market for her personal brand of glorified domesticity-""a vision of grace and creativity in a world full of haste and shoddy goods."" Propelled to new heights by the success of her popular Martha Stewart Living magazine and a syndicated television series, Stewart consolidated a host of activities and marketing ventures under the corporate umbrella of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia in 1997. Although Stewart's career faltered with her 2004 conviction on charges stemming from an insider trading probe, it has rebounded. Today Stewart remains a highly effective purveyor of lifestyle concepts and products."
111045,"General George C. Marshall was instrumental in winning the Allied victory in World War II and, afterward, in securing the peace and stability of battle-scarred Europe through the Marshall Plan, the highly successful program of American aid named for him. Marshall appeared on six Time covers between 1940 and 1948, and all were done by artists other than Chaliapin. Two of the covers depicted him as Man of the Year: the first when he was U.S. Army chief of staff, and the second when he was secretary of state. This work represents the only occasion when Boris Chaliapin ever portrayed Marshall, but Time never used it on the cover. Given Marshall’s civilian attire and the military imagery depicted in the canopy of gray clouds, this portrait was likely done when he was secretary of defense (1950–51)."
111068,"Boris Chaliapin was Time’s favorite cover artist for depicting movie actresses and women of elegance, such as Sophie Gimbel, the noted fashion designer for Saks Fifth Avenue’s Salon Modern in Manhattan. Gimbel was a leading proponent of the ""New Look"" in women’s clothing and fashioned her designs around the elements of simple lines, elegance, and expensive fabrics. The cover story focused on the ""turmoil"" in the fashion industry about identifying exactly ""what is the New Look?""   Chaliapin apparently was struggling with his own sense of design when he first submitted this profile of Gimbel. Time editors must have questioned the bizarre placement of the draped model, which Gimbel seemingly wears like a hairpiece. In his redesign, which appeared on the magazine (below), Chaliapin posed Gimbel frontally and placed the suave model in the background. "
111073,"Gloria Swanson was one of the most glamorous faces of the silent film era and was a legendary Hollywood icon until her death at age eighty-four. In February 1951 she had just won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama for her role as Norma Desmond, ""a faded silent movie star,"" in the film Sunset Boulevard. In anticipation of Swanson also winning an Academy Award, Time commissioned Chaliapin to paint the cover portrait of her seen here. But that year the Oscar for Best Actress went to Judy Holliday for her performance in Born Yesterday. In haste, the magazine turned to Chaliapin to produce a replacement cover portrait for its issue of April 9, 1951—not of Holliday, but of Barbara Bel Geddes, the rising young star of Broadway who was beginning a 924-performance run of Otto Preminger’s hit comedy, The Moon Is Blue. "
111076,"Time magazine has had a long tradition of using contract artists for its weekly covers. Favorite artists and contemporaries of Boris Chaliapin were Boris Artzybasheff and Ernest Hamlin Baker. Time’s editors referred to the three of them as the ABCs of the magazine’s art department. Chaliapin’s portrait of Stan ""The Man"" Musial, the St. Louis Cardinals’ All-Star hitter and outfielder, was never published, nor do we know when or why it was made. Musial appeared on the September 5, 1949, cover of Time; however, he was portrayed by Baker (below). Given the success of Musial’s twenty-two-season career, all with the Cardinals, there were numerous opportunities for him to have been featured on Time. Musial held many major league records, was a perennial All-Star, and played on three World Series championship teams. "
111141,"This undated depiction of a city crime scene by Boris Chaliapin represents a rare departure from Time’s traditional portrait cover, and was probably done near the end of the artist’s career. This unpublished work suggests two evolving trends that began to emerge in the 1970s: Time covers began focusing more on topical subjects instead of portraits, and photography began to replace illustration art. These trends of modern journalism have now prevailed to the degree that Time may use an original work of art only for such special occasions as the Person of the Year cover. "
111156,"Boris Chaliapin almost never drew his own likeness. Yet in 1958, Time published a photograph of a rare self-portrait session captioned Three Faces of Chaliapin. Thirteen years later, the artist returned to the mirror, pencil in hand, and sketched this drawing the year after he retired as a cover artist for Time."
111222,"Born Saude, near Cresco, Iowa    Plant geneticist and pathologist Norman Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for both his scientific breakthrough in developing “high-yielding short-strawed, disease-resistant wheat” and his humanitarian work in placing the “new cereal strains into extensive production to feed the hungry people of the world.” This achievement made Borlaug a central figure in what was called the “green revolution,” a series of scientific advances resulting in massive increases in the world’s food production. Borlaug viewed his work as providing “a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation, a breathing space in which to deal with the population monster.” Created in the year in which he won the Nobel Prize, this photograph pictures Borlaug in a Mexican wheat field, holding bunches of the so-called “miracle” wheat that he developed by crossing a native Mexican strain with a Japanese dwarf variety."
111582,"This rare group portrait was taken at Wounded Knee, South Dakota, on January 16, 1891, one day after the last Lakota surrendered following the Battle of Wounded Knee. It includes William ""Buffalo Bill"" Cody (at center, wearing a wide-brimmed hat), the famous showman who traveled there after the fighting to help negotiate a peace agreement and to recruit performers for his touring Wild West Show. The photograph also features many of the prominent Lakota leaders who were present at the battle, including Young Man Afraid of His Horses (seated with hat at center), a noted warrior who advocated negotiation with the United States, and Kicking Bear (seated next to him), one of the leaders of the Ghost Dance, a messianic religion that the Lakota had recently adopted. Regarded as the ""last of the Indian wars,"" the Battle of Wounded Knee was a one-sided conflict that resulted in the death of approximately 300 Lakota men, women, and children."
111585,"Born Grayling, Michigan    Writer Jim Harrison has reworked the legacy of William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, and Wallace Stegner to his own original purposes. Set in his home state of Michigan or in the Southwest, Harrison’s writing charts the life cycles (and life crises) of his characters against an acute observation of the natural world. His first novel, Wolf (1971), was a fictional memoir of a naturalist tracking wolves in Michigan. Harrison has been especially successful as a writer of novellas such as Legends of the Fall (1979), The Woman Lit by Fireflies (1990), and The Summer He Didn’t Die (2005). Although he is a successful novelist, Harrison considers himself first and foremost a poet. His poetry addresses the deep sense of the spirituality inherent in nature more directly than does his prose; he is strongly influenced by Asian poetry."
111586,"Born New York City    Born Louis Terkel, this Pulitzer Prize-winning author is best remembered for his long-running radio show and his books about the American experience. In 1952 he began hosting ""The Studs Terkel Program,"" a one-hour broadcast out of Chicago that aired each weekday and ran for forty-five years. In addition to playing music, Terkel interviewed a galaxy of different guests, the famous and non-famous alike. These interviews-which he called ""guerrilla journalism""-helped establish oral history as a serious discipline and became the primary material for several highly popular books, including Hard Times (1970) and The Good War (1985). About his interviewing technique, he later commented, ""the thing I'm able to do, I guess, is break down walls. If they think you're listening, they'll talk.""

Known as a neo-traditional country performer, Strait harks back to the sounds of Merle Haggard and George Jones with his singing, clothes, and stage presence. Photographer Michael O'Brien captures the Strait on the family's century-old, 2,000-acre cattle ranch in Pearsall, Texas. Shown with his signature ten-gallon hat, jeans, western shirt, and oversized belt buckle, Strait stays true to his country roots.   Over his career, Michael O'Brien has photographed for Life, the New York Times Sunday Magazine, and National Geographic, among other publications. This image was taken for the cover of Texas Monthly."
111757,"   Unions used strikes as fundamental pressure tactics against employers. In September 1965, several months after a successful grape strike in the Coachella Valley had granted grape-pickers an increase in salaries within a week, the mostly Filipino Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) decided to strike for higher wages in the town of Delano. There, growers seemed less likely to give in quickly, as the harvest lasted longer in the San Joaquin Valley. Also, many of the workers in the valley were affiliated with the primarily Mexican NFWA instead of the AWOC. Looking for strength in numbers, Larry Itliong, president of the AWOC, asked César Chávez and the National Farm Workers Association to collaborate. On September 16, Mexican Independence Day, the NFWA voted unanimously to strike with the AWOC. The ensuing group was ethnically and culturally diverse, also including African American, Puerto Rican, and Arab farm workers. The strike lasted five years.     Dolores Huerta     Los sindicatos se valían de las huelgas como táctica básica de presión contra sus patronos. En septiembre de 1965, varios meses después de una exitosa huelga en el Valle de Coachella en la que los recolectores de uva lograron un aumento de salario en cuestión de una semana, el Comité Organizador de Trabajadores Agrícolas (AWOC), de matrícula en su mayoría filipina, decidió irse a la huelga por mejores salarios en el pueblo de Delano. Allí los rancheros parecían menos dispuestos a ceder rápidamente, dado que la cosecha duraba más tiempo en el Valle de San Joaquín. Además, muchos de los trabajadores del valle estaban afiliados a la Asociación Nacional de Trabajadores Campesinos (NFWA), en su mayoría mexicana, y no con el AWOC. Buscando más apoyo, Larry Itliong, presidente del AWOC, solicitó la colaboración de César Chávez y la NFWA. El 16 de septiembre, Día de la Independencia de México, la NFWA votó unánimemente por irse a la huelga junto con el AWOC. El grupo que allí surgió era diverso étnica y culturalmente, e incluía también a afroamericanos, puertorriqueños y árabes. La huelga duró cinco años.

111758,"On March 17, 1966, César Chávez and approximately 100 individuals set off on a march from the town of Delano and onto Highway 99. Hundreds of supporters gathered along the way through the farmland of California’s Central Valley. Twenty-five days later, when the procession arrived in Sacramento on Easter Sunday, the crowd had increased to 10,000, making this the largest demonstration of farm workers to date in the history of California.  This photograph was taken during Chávez’s address to the ecstatic audience. The movement had achieved its first victory a few days before the end of the pilgrimage when, afraid of bad publicity, Schenley Industries signed a contract with the National Farm Workers Association recognizing the union’s demands. In solidarity, the Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee served as the signatory witness.   El 17 de marzo de 1966, César Chávez y alrededor de cien personas iniciaron una marcha desde el pueblo de Delano hacia la Carretera 99. Cientos de simpatizantes se les unieron a lo largo de la ruta a través de los campos del Valle Central de California. Veinticinco días después, cuando la procesión llegó a Sacramento el domingo de Pascua, los manifestantes ya sumaban 10,000, con lo cual esta ha sido la manifestación más grande de obreros campesinos en la historia de California hasta hoy.  Esta foto se tomó durante el discurso de Chávez ante la jubilosa audiencia. El movimiento había logrado su primera victoria pocos días antes de terminar la peregrinación, cuando Schenley Industries, temerosa de la mala prensa, firmó un convenio con la Asociación Nacional de Trabajadores Campesinos en el que reconocía las exigencias del sindicato. En un gesto solidario, el Comité Organizador de Trabajadores Agrícolas sirvió como testigo signatario.

111769,"Born Birmingham, Alabama    Keith Carter's photograph of Walker Percy pictures the famed writer on the front porch of his Louisiana home. Trained to become a psychiatrist, Percy left the field of medicine in 1942 after a bout with tuberculosis; yet, as a writer, he was constantly probing the mind and condition of mankind. While many of his novels are semi-autobiographical and draw on his family's long history of living along the Mississippi, he was a literary modernist and avoided a distinctly ""southern"" style. ""I think the day of regional Southern writing is all gone,"" he commented in 1972. ""People who try to write in that style are usually repeating a phased-out genre-or doing Faulkner badly."" In novels like The Last Gentleman, Lancelot, and The Moviegoer-which won the National Book Award for fiction in 1961-Percy explored what he described as the ""dislocation of man in the modern age."""
111785,"Born San Jose, California  On September 11, 2001, when it became clear that terrorists were using hijacked airplanes to attack the United States, Secretary of Transportation Norman Mineta acted decisively to shut down air space across the entire country, preempting the possibility of further hijackings. Mineta made the decision just moments after Flight 77 hit the Pentagon and while 4,546 planes were still in the sky.  Born in San José, California, to immigrant Japanese parents, Mineta and his family were interned in Wyoming during World War II. After college and military service, Mineta launched his political career as mayor of San José. He served in Congress for twenty years before retiring to work in the airplane industry. He returned to government as a cabinet member in the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush."
111870,"Born Minneapolis, Minnesota    Creator of the beloved comic strip Peanuts, cartoonist Charles M. Schulz gave millions of newspaper readers something to look forward to each day. From the strip's debut on October 2, 1950, until its final original installment on February 13, 2000, Schulz delivered humor, warmth, and wisdom with the help of an endearing ensemble of characters that included Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Schroeder, and the irrepressible beagle, Snoopy. The strip's appeal extended well beyond the funny pages, inspiring a plethora of Peanuts offerings such as books, greeting cards, television specials, and toys that continue to reach new audiences.  In this portrait by renowned photographer Yousuf Karsh, Schulz is seen in his studio with pen in hand. On the drawing board before him is a partially completed Peanuts Sunday comic featuring the latest episode in the continuing saga of Charlie Brown, Lucy, and the snatched football.   "
111873,"Born Lancaster County, Pennsylvania  Businessman-turned-politician Simon Cameron allied himself with the Jacksonian Democrats and then with the nativist Know-Nothings before joining the Republican Party in 1856. A master of machine politics, Cameron enjoyed powerful backing from Pennsylvania Republicans when he sought his party’s presidential nomination in 1860. After the fight for the nomination became a contest between Abraham Lincoln and William H. Seward, Lincoln’s backers made a bid to secure Pennsylvania’s support for their candidate by promising Cameron a prominent place in Lincoln’s administration. Wary of Cameron’s reputation for corruption, Lincoln balked at offering him a cabinet post, but when Cameron forced his hand, Lincoln reluctantly made him secretary of war. Cameron’s tenure in that position was brief and controversial, and in 1862 he left to serve as U.S. minister to Russia.  This portrait is typical of the elaborately hand-colored images introduced by a number of major photography studios in the late 1850s."
111972,"Born Boston, Massachusetts    In 1825 the young sculptor Horatio Greenough crossed the Atlantic to study in Rome and subsequently settled in Florence, where he established his studio. In doing so, Greenough set a pattern of European expatriation that aspiring American sculptors would follow for decades. When Congress selected him to create a statue of George Washington for the United States Capitol in 1832, Greenough became the first American-born carver to receive a major commission from the federal government. After the completed sculpture was installed in Washington in 1842, many derided Greenough's monumental representation of a semi-nude Washington draped in classical garb. "
112005,"Tommy Lasorda's six decades with the Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers establishes his claim that when he bleeds, he bleeds Dodger blue. Lasorda began his career as a pitcher with the Concord Weavers in 1945, served three years in the army, and was drafted by the Dodgers. He made his major-league debut in 1954, pitching two seasons for the Dodgers and one for Kansas City.  In 1961 the Dodgers signed him as a scout, then manager, for their farm teams, and in 1973 he became their third-base coach. Lasorda became manager of the Dodgers in 1976 and won two World Series championships (1981, 1988), four pennants, and eight division titles, retiring in 1996. In 1997 he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Lasorda came out of retirement to manage the U.S. baseball team in the 2000 Olympics and led them to a gold medal over the heavily favored Cuban team."
112189,"On September 29, 1972, reporter Carl Bernstein called President Nixon's campaign manager John Mitchell at 11:30 p.m. to ask him to comment on a Woodward-Bernstein story to be published the next day. The story described how, beginning when he was attorney general and continuing through the campaign, Mitchell controlled a ""secret fund"" that was to be used to gather intelligence on Democrats. Exploding into the phone, Mitchell shouted ""JEEEEESUS,"" and then-after Bernstein read more of the story incriminating him-""It's all been denied. Katie Graham's gonna get her tit caught in a big fat wringer if that's published."" With Ben Bradlee's okay, Mitchell's graphic quote was added to the story, although minus the anatomical reference. That remark, Graham wrote in her memoir, was fated to live on in the annals of Watergate as ""one of the principal public links of me with the affair."""
112199,"Assessing the Washington Post Company in the late 1980s, Katharine Graham wrote that it was ""clearly a success."" She had worked hard to establish that journalistic excellence and profitability went hand in hand. Part of this success came from great staff, but she also described the importance of family in nurturing the Post-from her father, through Phil, to her son Don, who was taking on more and more responsibilities. The Post also succeeded because it competed hard: ""We worked never to let an inch or a dollar of advertising slip away without a fight. We always anguished over being beaten on a story-and still do."" With the paper in good standing, and with colleagues such as Ben Bradlee planning to retire, Graham decided in 1991 to step down as president of the company."
112256,"Born Washington, D.C.  Rosalind Krauss is an influential art critic and heir to the critical tradition of Clement Greenberg, who half-admiringly, half-exasperatingly dubbed her as the ""Jewish girl with the typewriter""—a pose demonstrated in this portrait. After receiving her Ph.D. from Harvard, Krauss established herself as a leading scholar and theoretician of modernism and modern art. Her own work, as well as that done with colleagues and students, loosely crystallized around the journals October and ArtForum, has created a critical paradigm for studying modern art. She has been especially receptive to importing psychological concepts into art scholarship. Krauss now teaches at Columbia University. As well as publishing, she has mounted art exhibitions at such sites as the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Guggenheim in New York City. In 2012 the College Art Association honored her at a Distinguished Scholars Session."
112257,"Born Milwaukee, Wisconsin    Husband and wife Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne formed a dynamic actor-and-producer team that dominated early twentieth-century American theater. Together, the couple's effortless comedies delighted Broadway audiences. In 1928 ""the fabulous Lunts"" solidified their star power when they stipulated contractually that they must always perform as a pair. Critics praised their ""infinite subtlety, resource and drollery"" and declared, ""Miss Fontanne and Mr. Lunt are a matchless pair of volatile comedians.""                 Lunt's dashing appeal is captured in this portrait by the couple's friend, theater designer Claggett Wilson. The Lunts commissioned him to adorn the walls of their Wisconsin estate, Ten Chimneys, with painted murals. The original frame of this portrait matches woodwork used at the house. Lunt's beret may reference a 1928 trip that he, Fontanne, and Wilson took to the Basque country in Spain."
112258,"Born Baltimore, Maryland  A prominent clinical neurologist, Barnard Sachs enjoyed a long medical career that flourished as neurology developed into a specialized study of medicine around the turn of the century. Sachs received degrees from Harvard University and the University of Vienna in Austria. After he returned to New York City in 1884, he established a private practice for the treatment of mental and nervous disorders. Sachs’s seminal 1887 study of a childhood enzyme deficiency now known as Tay-Sachs disease contributed much to the emerging field of pediatric neurology. His book The Normal Child (1926) became a popular manual on child-rearing for the general public.  This likeness, painted by Latvian-American artist Henry R. Rittenberg, is a smaller replica of Sachs’s official portrait at the New York Academy of Medicine, where he served as president."
112263,"Born Newark, New Jersey    As a twentieth-century portrait painter, Raphael Soyer continued to work in a realistic vein even as abstraction came to rule the art world. He was noted for his empathetic and sympathetic likenesses, especially of family and friends, such as the poet Allen Ginsberg. Soyer and Ginsberg were part of the post-World War II cultural scene in New York, and they became friends after meeting in 1965. Ginsberg by then was famous as the author of ""Howl""-the quintessential statement of postwar rebellion-and many subsequent works. Soyer signals Ginsberg's poetic career by painting him holding a list that includes ""Howl"" and ""Kaddish."" But Soyer really painted this dual portrait to commemorate the poet's long relationship with Peter Orlovsky, with whom he lived and worked for nearly forty years. This is NPG's first oil portrait of Ginsberg, who had previously been represented in photographs and drawings."
112265,"Martha Clarke choreographs for dance, theater, the visual arts, and opera, and her productions have ranged from classic selections of Mozart to avant-garde theater works. Her best-known composition, The Garden of Earthly Delights (1984), melds text, dance, music, and the eponymous painting by Hieronymus Bosch.   Artist Philip Grausman was married to Clarke when he created this intimate, uniquely cast bust capturing her introspection and beauty. The dancer’s graceful neck suggests inner strength; her stylized features evoke a timeless quality while still capturing a strong likeness."

Spanning five decades, her column ran in more than 1,200 newspapers and reached more than 90 million readers. She competed with her twin sister, who was ""Dear Abby."" Landers's portrait was painted twice, in 1977 and 1988, by Roger Robles, a California artist patronized by celebrities and members of Chicago society. Landers preferred the latter portrait as being ""less starchy looking,"" and it was displayed in her apartment until her death."
112268,"Born New York City     In Elizabeth Peyton’s portrait of a youthful-looking Marc Jacobs, the worlds of art and fashion intersect in fruitful, mutually creative ways, going beyond aesthetics to encompass the glamour and sex appeal of public display and commerce. Jacobs’s dazzlingly successful design career has morphed from a controversial “grunge” collection for Perry Ellis, to the establishment of his own ongoing “Marc Jacobs” and “Marc by Marc Jacobs” labels, to his role as the creative director for the prestigious Louis Vuitton company, a job he left in 2013. As a designer, Jacobs fully embraces the public element of celebrity, and his brooding sensuality is a part of his—and his brand’s—allure.  Peyton’s celebrity portraits often imply the androgyny, youthful beauty, and ennui of the fashion world. Here she acknowledges the influence of fashion and fashion photography, depicting Jacobs confronting the viewer as a cheeky, disheveled bad boy, replete with cigarette.    Marc Jacobs  nacido en 1963  Nacido en la ciudad de Nueva York     Elizabeth Peyton nos presenta a un Marc Jacobs juvenil en un retrato donde se cruzan los mundos del arte y la moda en una relación creativa y fecunda que trasciende la estética para abarcar el glamour y la atracción sensual del comercio y el espectáculo. La deslumbrante carrera de Jacobs como diseñador lo ha llevado desde una controversial colección grunge para Perry Ellis hasta la creación de sus propias marcas, “Marc Jacobs” y “Marc by Marc Jacobs”, y luego al puesto de director creativo de la prestigiosa firma Louis Vuitton, al cual renunció en 2013. En su trabajo, Jacobs acoge de lleno el aspecto público de la celebridad y su taciturna sensualidad es parte de su encanto, y el de su marca.  En sus retratos de celebridades, Peyton a menudo alude al elemento andrógino, a la belleza juvenil, a la displicencia del mundo de la moda. Aquí reconoce la influencia del diseño y la fotografía de modas, ofreciéndonos a un Marc Jacobs que confronta al público como un chico travieso y desaliñado, sin faltar el cigarrillo.

112542,"Jason Salavon  born 1970    Jason Salavon, a Chicago-based artist, expands traditional conceptions of portraiture with his use of digital manipulation. Building on the legacy of Nancy Burson, Salavon creates programs that layer photographic or video images to produce blurred composites that resist immediate identification. In challenging the impulse to accept photographic representation as real, Salavon forces us to acknowledge the formulas that define the way we present ourselves to the world, and that we use to recognize others. Salavon's Late Night Triad (2003) captures American late-night television's three most popular hosts: Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien, and David Letterman. A combination of sixty-four nights of continually taped programs, Salavon's animated portrait, which runs approximately three-and-a-half minutes, accentuates the typical features of each television personality's routine. Unlike conventional portraiture, we do not recognize these performers from their faces, which cannot be readily deciphered, but rather from the combination of movement and vocal intonations that we have come to expect from each.  "
112579,"Born Hamlet, North Carolina    Regarded as one of the greatest jazz saxophonists of all time, John Coltrane (1926-1967) initially performed in the late 1940s and 1950s with small ensembles fronted by musicians such as Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis. He also struggled with drug and alcohol addiction before successfully overcoming these twin demons. In 1960, the year he scored a huge popular hit with his recording of ""My Favorite Things,"" Coltrane established his own group-one that played his music and arrangements on albums including Giant Steps, A Love Supreme, and Ascension. Coltrane was a great breaker of musical forms, and by the end of his career he was playing long, improvisational compositions that sought an almost religious transcendence of the performer. Coltrane's style-both in the bebop era and in his later improvisations-continues to influence new generations of musicians.    Titled Coltrane #24, Roy DeCarava's photograph uniquely conjures the mood and intensity of a Coltrane performance. "
112663,"Born Chicago, Illinois  Journalist William Shirer helped pioneer the rise of broadcast journalism in the late 1930s. A foreign correspondent for the Chicago Tribune and the Universal News Service, he was in Vienna when CBS’s Edward R. Murrow hired him in 1937. War was threatening across Europe, and when Hitler seized Austria in the Anschluss of March 1938, Shirer—the first of “the Murrow Boys”—broadcast the events as they happened. The great era of broadcast news was soon launched as CBS began producing a thirty-minute European radio round-up from Berlin, Vienna, Paris, Rome, and London.   In addition to his broadcasting, Shirer wrote vivid accounts of history-in-the-making. He kept a journal detailing the coming of war and in 1941 published Berlin Diary: The Journal of a Foreign Correspondent, 1934–1941. His major study of Hitler’s rise was published in 1960 and became a phenomenal best-seller. The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich is still ranked as one of the highest-selling nonfiction books of all time. "
112664,"Born Lancaster, Pennsylvania  One of the most prominent journalists in the first half of the twentieth century, Dorothy Thompson built an international reputation based on her three-times-a-week newspaper column “On the Record,” regular NBC radio broadcasts, and extensive lecturing. She was the model for Katharine Hepburn’s character in Woman of the Year (1942) and was tagged by Time magazine as the most influential woman in America after Eleanor Roosevelt.  Thompson’s specialty was international affairs. She interviewed Adolph Hitler in 1931 for Cosmopolitan, and her subsequent urgent warnings about the rise of Nazism led Hitler to expel her from Germany when he came to power in 1933. Thompson continued to sound her powerful voice against Fascism, and became a trusted adviser to presidents and prime ministers as war raged. Winston Churchill said, “She has shown what one valiant woman can do with the power of a pen.”"
112666,"Born Newport News, Virginia    William Styron was only twenty-six when his first novel, Lie Down in Darkness, was published in 1951 to broad critical acclaim. The story of a family's response to a young girl's suicide, it drew on his southern upbringing and established him as one of the rising stars in a new generation of American writers after World War II. Throughout his literary career, Styron often addressed difficult topics. The Confessions of Nat Turner-a fictional account of a violent nineteenth-century slave rebellion-probed the South's violent past, drawing both praise and criticism and earning its author the Pulitzer Prize in 1967. Sophie's Choice from 1979 was an equally devastating novel about the Holocaust and a woman's struggle to reconcile her wartime internment at Auschwitz. Dmitri Kasterine's portrait shows Styron at his Connecticut home during a period when he was grappling with recurrent bouts of depression, the subject of his 1990 memoir, Darkness Visible."
112669,"Born Modesto, California    The creator of the epic science fiction series Star Wars and a joint creator of the Indiana Jones adventure series, George Lucas has combined a gift for high-drama storytelling with groundbreaking visual and sound effects to achieve Hollywood superstardom. Lucas studied filmmaking at the University of Southern California. One of his first feature films was American Graffiti, a 1973 coming-of-age drama that drew upon his early passion for automobile culture. In part because of its commercial success, Lucas began to develop the first Star Wars, which after its 1977 debut surpassed Steven Spielberg's Jaws to become the highest-grossing movie at that time. Andres Serrano's portrait shows the film director in 1999, the year that Stars Wars: The Phantom Menace was released."
112777,"Born Lancaster, Pennsylvania     Simon Snyder, who would rise from being a storekeeper in the Pennsylvania backcountry to governor of the state, was a man of little formal education but with a strong sense of duty and loyalty to Jeffersonian republican principles. In the late 1790s and first decade of the nineteenth century he represented the radical republican elements in the Pennsylvania Assembly, and was Speaker in that body for three terms. As a Jeffersonian he sought to reduce the powers of the executive and judiciary in relation to the legislature. In 1808 he challenged the Federalist governor of the state, who represented the commercial eastern counties and cities, and won the first of three elections, an indication of the growing political strength of the agrarian backcountry. Snyder’s reforms included expanding public education, abolishing the death penalty, and promoting a program of internal improvements.              David Edwin’s steel engraving, based on a Thomas Sully portrait, was designed for broad dissemination. "
112780,"Born Brooklyn, New York    One of Nike's most famous posters, Wings features Chicago Bulls basketball legend Michael Jordan along with a quote from poet William Blake, ""No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings."" With Jordan as their marquee player, the Bulls dominated the NBA in the 1990s. Jordan could also claim one NCAA championship with the University of North Carolina and six NBA championships. He was a five-time league MVP and a two-time Olympic gold-medal winner, was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, and briefly played minor-league baseball. In addition to his extraordinary athletic achievements, Jordan became the most successful advertising figure the world had ever known. The Wings poster documents a shift in athletes' earning potential from their performance to their endorsement deals; it also marks a historic moment when African American sports figures could serve as role models to all Americans.  "
112801,"Born Live Oak County, Texas    Described by a fellow writer as unmistakably Texan ""as a Longhorn steer,"" J. Frank Dobie helped to establish the southwestern United States as a subject of national importance in American literature. Beginning with the publication of A Vaquero of the Brush Country in 1929, Dobie authored more than three dozen books. For twenty-five years, he also wrote a weekly Sunday column for various Texas newspapers, where he told tales of southwestern lore and opined about issues large and small. About his gift for capturing this region's history he recalled, ""somehow or other I have been able to get to the heart of common people and rob them of their stories."" Before his death in 1964, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by his old friend Lyndon B. Johnson. Alfred Eisenstaedt's photograph dates from 1943, the year that Dobie published his landmark Guide to Life and Literature of the Southwest."
112803,"Born Cape Elizabeth, Maine  John Ford was one of the most accomplished figures in Hollywood history. He spent fifty years acting, producing, and most notably directing both silent and sound films. He is best known for such Westerns as Stagecoach (1939) and The Searchers (1956), and he won Academy Awards for screen adaptations of The Grapes of Wrath (1940) and How Green Was My Valley (1941). During World War II, he worked with the United States Navy to train a documentary film unit, which he commanded throughout the war, winning two more Academy Awards—for The Battle of Midway (1942) in 1943 and for December 7th (1943) in 1944. This photograph by Hollywood portraitist Roman Freulich shows Ford in his naval uniform. He continued to serve as a naval reserve officer after the war and attained the rank of rear admiral. "
112804,"Born Genoa, Italy    Christopher Columbus, as the first man to discover fast and reliable routes across the Atlantic Ocean, would forever link Europe and the Americas. Although there is no known life portrait of Columbus, this engraving from André Thevet's volume of collected biographies, Les Vrais Pourtraits et Vies des Hommes Illustres (Paris, 1584), lays claim to being the most authentic image in existence. Visiting French and foreign collections, Thevet meticulously researched images to accurately illustrate his biographical essays. The engraving of Columbus, he asserted, was taken from an oil painting by a Dutch artist living in Lisbon at the same time as the explorer. Although some consider Columbus's reputation tainted by his harsh treatment of American natives, his skills as a navigator and his boldness in risking the unknown are still noteworthy, and his voyage was a turning point in history.  "
112816,"Born Manoguayabo, Distrito Nacional, Dominican Republic      Pedro J. Martinez was told that he was too small to be a major-league power pitcher, yet from his first appearance he consistently overpowered the best hitters in the world. He won three Cy Young Awards in a span of four seasons and to date has a record of 219 wins and only 100 losses. In 2000, the very heart of the home-run/steroid era, Martinez had an earned-run average of 1.74-more than three runs a game less than the American League average; he allowed only seventeen home runs in 217 innings pitched. Baseball authority Peter Gammons believes that ""Pedro's seven-year period, 1997-2003, was the most dominant stretch of any pitcher in baseball history."" Martinez is also widely applauded for his commitment to advancing opportunities for less fortunate children in his native Dominican Republic and in the United States, where he is a naturalized citizen.   Artist Susan Miller-Havens titled this portrait El Orgullo y Determinación (Pride and Determination) as a statement of Martinez's accomplishment in overcoming obstacles and becoming one of the most dominant pitchers of baseball's modern era.   "
112839,"Christo  born 1935  Born Gabrovo, Bulgaria  Jeanne-Claude  1935-2009  Born Casablanca, Morocco    Pioneers in the field of monumental installation art, Christo and Jeanne-Claude began their artistic collaboration in 1961 and together succeeded in creating works that, despite their ephemeral nature, have had a lasting impact on the public consciousness. Whether erecting The Running Fence (1972-76), which rippled for miles through Northern California; creating Surrounded Islands, Biscayne Bay, Greater Miami, Florida (1980-83) by encircling eleven islands with buoyant pink material; or ""wrapping"" Berlin's Reichstag in silver fabric (1995), Christo and Jeanne-Claude inspired viewers to experience both the natural and the built environment in new ways. With The Gates-an installation comprising more than 7,500 bannerlike saffron panels in New York's Central Park in 2005-the artists succeeded in bringing to fruition a project they had first conceived in 1979. With their Gates as a backdrop, the jubilant couple posed for this image by their longtime friend and exclusive photographer Wolfgang Volz."
112844,"Born Brooklyn, New York  “Since the death of Enrico Caruso,” Stereo Review enthused in its February 1979 issue, “no singer of any nationality . . . has brought opera more to the consciousness of the general American public than Beverly Sills.” At the time, Sills had just announced her appointment as director of the New York City Opera Company, and the magazine was awarding her its annual Certificate of Merit. For Stereo Review’s pastel-colored cover, caricaturist Al Hirschfeld focused on the singer’s insouciant personality and legendary energy. Hirschfeld could summarize each persona with startling clarity, and his subjects usually loved his celebratory spoofing. His drawings, Arthur Miller noted, share an energetic joy of life: “the sheer tactical vibrance of the lines . . . make you feel that he has found a wit in your miserable features that may yet lend you a style and a dash you were never aware of in yourself.” "
112896,"One of the greatest athletes of all time, Michael Jordan embodied cool-in-motion, a singular aesthetic combination of flow, balance, and controlled power. Jordan surfed the air, floating like a hang glider then diving to the hoop like a hawk. He was a one-man athletic spectacle: you watched just to see what he might do next. His slam dunks alone helped make basketball a popular international sport, a showcase for an African American aesthetic mixing relaxation, hustle, and sudden bursts of speed. The highest-scoring player (per game) in NBA history, Jordan was an equally stellar defender. His work ethic was as legendary as his hang time, and he may have been the best clutch performer in sports history. Yet even Jordan was unable to lead a team to a championship as a one-man show until he developed an intellectual friendship with coach Phil Jackson: it led to the Chicago Bulls’ innovative triangle offense and then to six NBA championships."
112974,"Born New Orleans, Louisiana      Andrew Jackson Young was educated at Howard University and earned a divinity degree at the Hartford Seminary. While serving as pastor of a church in Marion, Alabama, in the mid-1950s, he was drawn to the civil rights struggle. Young studied Gandhi’s doctrine of nonviolence and applied it to African American peaceful protests. He soon joined Martin Luther King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference, working to register African American voters. In 1964 he became its executive director, where he helped organize peaceful protests and became one of King’s principal lieutenants. He was with the civil rights leader when King was shot in Memphis in 1968. Young was elected to three terms in Congress, was mayor of Atlanta, and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations during the Carter administration.  He has since immersed himself in philanthropic work and has written several books about his experiences in the civil rights movement.               Ross Rossin, who emigrated from Bulgaria in 2001, has created a photorealistic portrait that gives the viewer an unadulterated image of a man whose face shows a lifetime of experience."
112984,"Born Charleston (formerly Charles Town), South Carolina     Serving as an aide-de-camp to General George Washington, John Laurens demonstrated bravery, even recklessness, in battle. Taken prisoner in May 1780, he commissioned this tiny portrait in Philadelphia following his parole, probably as a memento for his wife, who was living in England with their young daughter. In 1781, Laurens obtained France’s commitment to station a fleet off the American coast, enabling Washington’s army to defeat the British forces at Yorktown."
112993,"The Joy of Art   This Time cover, taken from a collage self-portrait by the artist Robert Rauschenberg, plays off the 1970s best-selling book The Joy of Sex, suggesting the ways in which artistic creativity could be equally as exciting—and productive. By the 1970s Rauschenberg was firmly established as a major American artist, and he poses himself against artifacts both from his artistic career and scenes from his life on Captiva Island, Florida. The two figures on the upper left are Rauschenberg and his then-partner Terry Van Brunt, the latter rendered ambiguously invisible by the lettering of Time’s cover, suggesting that the joy of sex did not extend to gay men. "
112995,"Blacksnake, a Seneca/Six Nations chief, was one of the few Indian leaders who remained on the American side in the War of 1812, fighting in several battles on the Niagara frontier.   Although Seneca soldiers were honorably mustered out, the War of 1812 was a disaster for American Indians. They suffered major defeats at Horseshoe Bend and the loss of their most gifted leader, Tecumseh. The Treaty of Ghent promised them peace, ""to restore . . . all . . . [their] possessions, rights, and privileges,"" but Britain’s abandonment of Indian allies after the war ended its ability to resist an expanding America. "
113035,"Born Dillon, South Carolina    In February 2006, President George W. Bush appointed Princeton economics professor Ben Bernanke as chairman of the Federal Reserve. The subsequent implosion of the global economy made his job-running the central bank of United States, setting monetary policy, and stabilizing credit markets-critical for averting worldwide catastrophe. The markets, Bernanke noted, ""were in anaphylactic shock."" The Fed pumped money into the financial system, and Bernanke worked with Bush's and Obama's treasury secretaries, Congress, and world economic leaders to stabilize the crisis. Bernanke's actions were bold, unprecedented and controversial, earning him much praise, as well as criticism, from both sides of the political spectrum.   Mark Wagner's portrait, collaged from tiny strips of one-dollar bills, plays with contrasting implications about the value and symbolism of American currency and the extent of the Fed chairman's actual control over the monetary system.  "
113036,"Born Houston, Texas    One of the biggest recent developments in the American economy has been the shift in the consumer sector to providing previously hitherto luxury or specialty items for a mass market. Brands like Martha Stewart or Starbucks are based on a business plan of popularizing ""good taste""; snob appeal no longer works in a society in which everyone has equal access to fancy linens or gourmet coffees. John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods, is part of this revolution, creating a national chain of food stores that provide high-quality products at a price only marginally higher than chains like Safeway or Giant. Whole Foods began as a vegetarian store in Austin, Texas, run by Mackey and his girlfriend after they dropped out of college; the company now has stores across the United States. Mackey sees Whole Foods as a vehicle for social change both by encouraging healthy lifestyle choices, and in improving animal and human rights.   "
113037,"Martin Schoeller’s photograph of Tony Hawk pictures the skateboarder in the kitchen of his California home in 1999, the year in which he landed the first-ever ""900"" (two-and-a-half revolutions) in competition. A virtuoso known as the ""Birdman,"" Hawk is one part Michael Jordan and one part Evel Knievel. His tricks on the board are known for their creativity and daring. Having won his first competition at age eleven and turned professional at fourteen, he is the person most responsible for transforming an ""outlaw"" recreational pursuit into a global sporting phenomenon. While his street style has made him an icon of youth rebellion, he has been equally successful as an entrepreneur, launching his own line of sports equipment and a popular video game series. Other so-called extreme sports such as BMX biking and snowboarding owe much to Hawk’s achievements as a skater."
113096,"Born Worcester, Massachusetts    Robert H. Goddard, an internationally recognized advocate for spaceflight, was a pioneer of modern rocket propulsion. In 1917 he received a grant from the Smithsonian to further his rocket experiments, and the Smithsonian subsequently published his treatise, A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes. In 1926 Goddard successfully launched the world's first liquid-propellant rocket. His work attracted the attention of aviator Charles Lindbergh, who helped Goddard secure additional funding. In 1930 Goddard moved his research laboratory from Massachusetts to Roswell, New Mexico, where he enjoyed favorable weather all year.   This photograph, taken on location for the National Geographic Society, shows Goddard in his lab checking the fuel pump on a rocket. Goddard's work led to the development of the bazooka and other rocket-propelled weapons; it was appropriated by the Germans, who used it to develop the V-2 rocket."
113137,"Born Prince William (now Fauquier) County, Virginia  John Marshall, the fourth chief justice of the United States, established the concept of judicial review—in which the Supreme Court could pronounce a law of Congress as unconstitutional—and strengthened the idea of an independent federal judiciary. In cases brought to the Court between 1810 and 1824—years in which the Marshall Court enjoyed great stability and harmony—Marshall used the Court’s judicial review to nullify state laws violating constitutional restraints of state power. The effect of Marshall’s long tenure as chief justice (1801–35) was to strengthen the Court, the Constitution, and the federal government. The Court became a preeminent interpreter of the Constitution, and the federal government’s enumerated powers were given a broad interpretation, and made superior to those of the states.  Cephas Thompson painted a portrait of Marshall from life in Richmond, as well as six replicas for admirers, two years after Marshall presided at the trial of Aaron Burr for treason."
113138,"Born Kingisepp, Saaremaa, Estonia  Louis Kahn’s best-known buildings, including the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas (1966–72) and the Yale Center for British Art (1969–74), combined the strengths of modernist architecture with the architectural traditions of the past. He was known for his interest in both structure and light and was regarded as an important theorist and teacher at the University of Pennsylvania.              Kahn’s daughter, Alexandra Tyng, created this portrait from memory and photographs. Kahn is seated in his office in Philadelphia, surrounded by his books and a framed drawing of an unbuilt project for the Palazzo del Congressi in Venice. The artist intended to illuminate a moment of inspiration through her inclusion of the light shining on Kahn’s face."
113146,"Born New York City   George Carlin was an American stand-up comedian known for his blunt and unapologetic approach to taboo subjects, including politics, language, psychology and religion. Carlin’s “Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television” routine led to his arrest in 1972 for violating obscenity laws. The routine later became central to the 1978 U.S. Supreme Court case F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation. In a 5–4 decision, the Court affirmed the government’s power to censor material on public airwaves.  Carlin was a frequent performer and guest host on The Tonight Show during Johnny Carson’s tenure as host. He also appeared in numerous films, including the cult classics Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure (1989) and Bill and Ted’s Bogus Journey (1991). He starred in the sitcom The George Carlin Show from 1993 to 1995 and released fourteen HBO comedy specials. In 2008, Carlin was posthumously awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor."
113151,"Born near Rosebud River in present-day Montana  In the spring of 1876 Curly accepted an invitation to scout for George Custer and his Seventh Cavalry during their armed engagement with tribes on the northern plains. His own tribe, the Crow, had previously made peace with the United States. In late June—about a week before the United States was to celebrate its centennial—a force of Lakota and Northern Cheyenne warriors soundly defeated Custer and his command at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana. Curly was the only survivor from the main part of that fight. Two days after the battle, he reached military authorities and became the first eyewitness to report details about “Custer’s last stand.” The news shocked the nation and prompted the U.S. Army to redouble its commitment to subdue hostile tribes in the West. In the years that followed, Curly lived on the Crow reservation, serving for a time in the tribal police force."

113185,"Born Klein, Texas    Texas musician Lyle Lovett grew up in a ranching community north of Houston, his songwriting shaped by the diverse musical traditions of the American Southwest. Although typically associated with the country genre, Lovett has incorporated elements of folk, swing, blues, gospel, and jazz into his music. He is equally well-known for the narratives of his songs, which can range from elegiac laments to witty, sometimes outlandish, farces to full-throated celebrations. Since 1986, he has released thirteen albums, many with his renowned ""Large Band,"" a supporting cast that includes guitars, a cellist, a piano, a horn section, and several backup singers. In recent years Lovett has also acted in a number of films and television productions. Sidelined for six months in 2002 after being trampled by a bull, Lovett wrestles one to the ground in this 2004 photograph by Martin Schoeller."
113189,"Born St. Helen’s, near Liverpool, England  Scientist John W. Draper’s pioneering investigations of radiant energy were critical to the emerging field of spectrum analysis. His study of the properties of light also led him to experiment with photography. In partnership with Samuel F.B. Morse in 1840, Draper opened a daguerreian portrait studio on the rooftop of the New York University building where he chaired the medical school’s departments of chemistry and physiology. Created during his tenure as president of NYU’s medical school, this ambrotype dates from 1856, when Draper published Human Physiology, Statistical and Dynamical—the groundbreaking work that became the leading physiological textbook of its day."
113264,"Born Concord, California    Equally at home in comedic parts or dramatic roles, Tom Hanks is a versatile actor whose winning portrayals of ""average guys in extraordinary situations"" have made him a perennial box-office favorite. Hanks's initial big-screen successes came in the form of comedies such as Splash (1984), Big (1988), and Sleepless in Seattle (1993), but it was his riveting performance as the AIDS-stricken lawyer in Philadelphia and his title role in Forrest Gump that earned him back-to-back Academy Awards for Best Actor in 1993 and 1994. Since then, Hanks has continued his successful acting career while also expanding his reach to include screenwriting and directing, voicing characters in animated features such as the popular Toy Story series, and producing television programming that has ranged from Band of Brothers (2001) and Big Love (2006-present) to The Pacific (2010)."
113265,"Jay-Z is a rapper, writer, producer, and entrepreneur whose life reflects the rise of hip-hop to the epicenter of global popular culture. Raised in a Brooklyn housing project, Shawn Carter was at first called ""Jazzy,"" and it morphed into Jay-Z. Like a jazz musician, he improvises all his raps when recording, and his strength is his flow—his fast, smooth wordplay and flow of ideas. Carter's stage persona as Jay-Z mixes his past as a drug dealer from the ’hood—""Bed-Stuy was my country / Brooklyn my planet,"" he raps—with the swagger of a Rockefeller (his clothing line is called Roc-a-Fella). He represents a millennial synthesis of American culture’s love of outlaws, who live in opposition to social approval, with its love of extreme wealth, which insulates a person from everyday pressures. What happens when an inner-city party music and political forum becomes the soundtrack of global capitalism? Jay-Z’s ""Hard Knock Life"" is the ""ghetto anthem"" of these ironies."
113266,"Born Lockport, New York    Prolific and versatile are synonymous with Joyce Carol Oates. A writer of more than fifty novels on subjects as varied as serial killers, college professors, and most recently Marilyn Monroe, Oates also produces poetry, short stories, essays, and criticism. She published her first story while a student at Syracuse University, and the piece won the college fiction prize from Mademoiselle magazine. One of Oates's first novels, them (1969), won the National Book Award, and since then she has been frequently nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. Today, Oates is a distinguished professor of humanities at Princeton University. "
113271,"Born Bayside, New York  Edward Villella entered the School of American Ballet at age ten but took time off for college before returning to the school in 1955. In 1957 he was invited to join the New York City Ballet, where he worked with George Balanchine and took on many important roles until injuries forced his retirement in the mid-1980s. He soon became the first artistic director of the new Miami City Ballet, a position he still holds. In 1997 President Bill Clinton awarded him the National Medal of Arts, and Villella was also named a Kennedy Center Honoree.              Sacha Newley, whose drawings and paintings are steeped in his study of the Old Masters, captures Villella’s virility and resilience in this small portrait. "
113273,"Born Paris, France  In 1915, when New York City’s vice squad attempted to confiscate from an exhibition the whimsical female nudes drawn by Clara Tice, the incident vaulted the young Greenwich Village artist into the limelight and charmed Vanity Fair’s influential editor, Frank Crowninshield. He soon began to publish Tice’s sketches in the magazine, helping to launch her career. A discerning scout for new talent, Crowninshield, while cultured and cosmopolitan, admitted to a “perhaps preposterous” preference for the new over the old in society, arts, and culture. Vanity Fair published modern French and American painting and the work of T. S. Elliot and Gertrude Stein but also embraced humor and the popular arts. Crowninshield’s admiration for Tice was rewarded by this teasing portrait, in which slender nudes form his face while one of his beloved cats represents his famous mustache. "
113305,"Born near Oologah, Oklahoma  When Will Rogers was a young man, he lived the cowboy life, and yet, he felt restricted by the rustic lifestyle. He moved to South America, and then to South Africa, where he toured with a wild west show. It was there that he developed his skill as a trick roper. Around 1916, he transformed himself from a “ropin’ fool” to a “talkin’ fool,” and his career as a social commentator and entertainer took off.  This sculpted likeness, featuring his famous lariat, was created by Los Angeles neurosurgeon Emil Seletz, who also worked as a sculptor. Seletz had first met Rogers in an elevator at Cedars Sinai Hospital."
113361,"George Schneeman said that he “never painted anything with the idea that I was expressing myself.” His point of view, so antithetical to high modernism, was thoroughly appropriate to his art. In 1966, after many years in Italy, Schneeman moved to the Lower East Side in New York City. There, living near a number of poets and with his sense of art as a social construct, he created hundreds of wryly humorous collaborative works.  This pale, collaged portrait depicts two of those collaborators, poets Ron Padgett (born 1942) and Ted Berrigan (1934–1983). Padgett, on the left, recounted how the collaborative text written on the card in the center of the canvas came to be: “At some point, Ted wrote ‘I’m the Sky’ and I followed immediately with ‘in search of the bean fluids.’ . . . The underlying sense is that of a god (sky) who is trying to get his / her mind working well or working at all.”"
113367,"Born Duquesne, Pennsylvania  Al Hirschfeld’s drawing of Earl “Fatha” Hines is a variant of the one published on the cover of Stereo Review in February 1980, when the jazz pianist was awarded the magazine’s annual Certificate of Merit for outstanding contributions to the quality of American musical life. Stanley Dance, credited with reviving Hines’s career in 1964, noted in his accompanying article that “for more than fifty years Hines has been famous for the independence of his two hands.” Jazz commentators marveled at Hines’s ability to establish a separate rhythm and melody with his left hand rather than just keeping the beat. On one occasion, while listening to a playback, Hines himself commented that “the left hand got away from the right.” Through the double-imaging of the hands and the long flexible fingers, Hirschfeld, a jazz aficionado himself, conveys independence, movement, and speed."
113368,"Born Charleston, South Carolina  A leader of the African Methodist Episcopal (A.M.E.) Church for more than half a century, Bishop Daniel Alexander Payne contributed substantially to its growth and advocated for the formal education of its clergy. A free person of color, Payne opened a school for African Americans in Charleston in 1828, but was forced to close it in 1834 when South Carolina outlawed the education of blacks. Moving to Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, where he attended the Lutheran Theological Seminary, Payne became the first African American minister ordained by the Franckean Evangelical Lutheran Synod (1839). He joined the A.M.E. Church in 1841 and although some members of that denomination opposed his call for a standardized course of study for its ministers, his viewpoint prevailed, and he was elected a bishop in 1852. After purchasing Ohio’s Wilberforce University in 1863, Payne served as president of the nation’s first African American–administered institution of higher learning."
113369,"Born Edinburgh, Scotland   Inventor and educator Alexander Graham Bell sparked a communications revolution when he patented the telephone in 1876. Although his Bell Telephone Company would spend years in litigation against patent infringers and counterclaimants, it emerged triumphant in its defense of Bell’s original and ancillary patents. This photograph was made in New York City on October 18, 1892 at the formal opening of the first long-distance telephone line between New York and Chicago. The ceremonies marking the occasion included a brief telephone conversation between the mayors of the two cities and ended with Bell speaking to his former assistant, William H. Hubbard of Chicago. At the time of its installation, this was the longest telephone line in operation, being twice the length of any other in the American Telephone and Telegraph Company’s system. Bell would eventually live to see telephone service linking Washington, D.C., and Honolulu, Hawaii. "
113394,"Born Chicago, Illinois  This elegant drawing of Pauline Sabin was published to illustrate the May 8, 1932, New York Times Magazine article ""A Woman Crusader for the Wet Cause."" Sabin led a group of wealthy, stylish, and politically savvy women, who—after seeing the rise of organized crime, speakeasies, and other results of life under Prohibition—worked relentlessly to repeal the Eighteenth Amendment and renew the public sale of alcohol. In 1929 Sabin founded the Women’s Organization for National Prohibition Reform, which grew to more than one million members, making it the largest anti-Prohibition organization in the country. Detractors harped on Sabin’s success; one writer called the WONPR members ""the scum of the earth, parading around in skirts, and possibly late at night flirting with other women’s husbands at drunken and fashionable resorts."" By 1933, public opinion had shifted, and Prohibition was repealed upon ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment."

113488,"Born Danville, Vermont   A pioneer in automobile manufacturing, Henry Leland demanded high quality and exacting specifications. In 1902 he was hired by Cadillac, and within two years he took over the firm. His use of precisely made, standardized interchangeable parts made it possible to mass-produce a high-performance luxury automobile. Leland’s other advances included closed sedans, electric ignition—which replaced dangerous hand cranks—and the V–8 engine with thermostatic control. In 1917 he founded Lincoln Motor Company to build airplane engines during World War I. After the war he retooled the factory to produce the Lincoln luxury car. Distrustful of labor unions, Leland treated and paid his workers fairly to prevent discontent.  Financial difficulties and a postwar economic downturn forced Leland to sell his company to Henry Ford in 1922.  Leland was a striking figure with a shock of white hair and goatee, as shown here in this etching by Joseph Pierre Nuyttens."
113494,"Born Raleigh, North Carolina  Appointed military governor of the Union-occupied state of Tennessee by President Abraham Lincoln in 1862, Andrew Johnson later became the seventeenth president of the United States following Lincoln’s assassination. His lenient policies toward former Confederate states undermined efforts to extend civil rights to former slaves and earned Johnson the animosity of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton. Johnson was impeached and narrowly escaped conviction when he tried to remove his adversary.  This portrait was published by Ehrgott & Forbriger as part of a series of prints commemorating United States political figures at the height of the Civil War. A comparison of Johnson’s portrait to that of Edward Stanton, hanging nearby, reveals that the only changes made between the compositions concerned the faces of the figures. To reduce costs, the printers reused a limited number of templates to respond to a demand for representations of the country’s leaders. "
113496,"Born Cedar Rapids, Iowa  Don Bachardy drew this portrait from life just weeks before Carl Van Vechten’s death in 1964. Van Vechten, a critic and novelist married to Fania Marinoff, was an important advocate for the Harlem Renaissance. In addition, Van Vechten was a talented portrait photographer who depicted important figures of the early twentieth century, including Don Bachardy when he was only nineteen. Later, Bachardy produced this large pencil drawing of Van Vechten, which is signed and dated by the subject. Bachardy generally started with one eye and scaled the rest of the portrait around it. ""To me, every drawing and painting is a combination of two personalities,"" the artist wrote, ""and those two personalities are changing every day, every hour. So my work is really a kind of journal of the people I was with on a particular day."""
113497,"Born Odessa, Russia (now Ukraine)  Known for her roles in both Broadway plays, such as the 1916 version of The Tempest, and silent films like One of Our Girls, the Russian-born actress Fania Marinoff also attained prominence as the wife of critic and novelist Carl Van Vechten, an important champion of the Harlem Renaissance. As active figures in Harlem’s social scene, Van Vechten and Marinoff befriended many important artists and poets from the movement, including the Mexican painter and caricaturist Miguel Covarrubias. Through Covarrubias, Van Vechten and Marinoff met the Mexican painter and art educator Adolfo Best-Maugard. Van Vechten would later make an entry in his daybook recording Marinoff sitting for Best-Maugard at their apartment. The charming likeness highlights Marinoff’s celebrated large brown eyes, while the inclusion of her headdress and large dangling earrings emphasizes her dramatic flair."
113515,"The arrival of the Friendship in England    By 1928 Earhart was living in Boston, where she worked at a settlement house for immigrants. She continued to fly on weekends and also served as a sales representative for Kinner aircraft. That April she received a telephone call that would change her life forever. Amy Guest (1873–1959), a wealthy American who lived in England, had recently bought a trimotor plane that she named the Friendship and wished to underwrite a transatlantic flight. Charles Lindbergh had completed the first solo flight across the Atlantic a year earlier, and Guest wanted to see a woman make headlines for a similar feat. Guest was going to make the trip herself until her family objected because of the risk. Instead, she offered the opportunity to Earhart. This photograph was taken in Southampton, England, after the successful completion of that flight. It features (left to right) Guest, the three transatlantic flyers—mechanic Lewis Gordon (1901–1964), Earhart, and pilot Wilmer Stultz (1900–1929)—and the local mayor."
113518,"Amelia Earhart at Hyde Park High School in Chicago    After the Friendship flight, Earhart was flooded with invitations to speak to different groups. Because she had lived outside of Chicago for several years, many invitations came from that area. In mid-July she traveled to Chicago, where she was greeted by the mayor and a huge crowd of admirers. Among the highlights of her visit was a trip to the high school from which she had graduated in 1915. This photograph shows her with students at Hyde Park High School. During this same time, Earhart had also teamed with publicist George Putnam to write an account of her transatlantic trip, 20 Hrs., 40 Min. Drafted in a mere six weeks, this book and Earhart’s subsequent national lecture tour made her the public face not only for women in aviation but also for the changing role of women in American society."
113523,"Amelia Earhart and George Putnam  Earhart first met George Putnam (1887–1950) in 1928, prior to her transatlantic flight. Born into a prominent New York publishing family, Putnam made a name for himself as an Arctic explorer before returning to the publishing industry. He later recalled his first meeting with Earhart: ""When she appeared at my office I was busy, so she had to cool her heels—and didn’t like it much."" Invited by wealthy American expatriate Amy Guest to publicize the 1928 flight, Putnam helped to orchestrate it and the lecture tour that followed. The following year he divorced his wife and began a relationship with Earhart, who was ten years younger. Although she refused his marriage proposal on six different occasions, she ultimately agreed, and the two married in 1931. Putnam remained her chief publicist until her death."
113524,"Aviation notables lobby in Washington  In the same year that Earhart married, she became vice president of the National Aeronautic Association, an organization devoted to the advancement of flight in America. In this job she performed many duties, including lobbying Congress to provide greater resources for the burgeoning aviation industry. This photograph shows Earhart with other leading figures in Washington to champion the development of a small airplane that might be marketed to the wider public. Eugene Vidal—an All-American football star at West Point and the father of author Gore Vidal—played a lead role in this initiative and became close friends with Earhart. Standing third from left, the charismatic Vidal believed that this new plane might be no more expensive than an automobile. A prototype of the so-called ""flivver"" plane crashed during testing and ultimately never went into production. "
113525,"Amelia Earhart in an autogiro    Much experimentation in aeronautical design was occurring at this time. Earhart showed great interest in such work and became involved in testing several new planes. In this photograph she poses in an autogiro, an airplane with a conventional fuselage and four large rotor blades mounted above it. Although it was slow and awkward to handle, the plane had the advantage of being able to take off and land in a relatively short distance. Many admired the autogiro, including Thomas Edison, and Earhart became friends with its American manufacturer, Harold Pitcairn. In 1931 Earhart set an altitude record in the autogiro and later became the first person to pilot it across the country and back. That said, the plane was only slightly faster than a car on the open road; furthermore, it was more accident-prone that other airplanes. Earhart liked the autogiro but ultimately found it impractical for the long-distance flying that she enjoyed."
113526,"Amelia Earhart crosses the Atlantic flying solo  On May 21, 1932—exactly five years to the day after Charles Lindbergh’s historic transatlantic flight—Earhart became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic. This photograph shows her shaking hands with Dan McCallon, the Irish farmer who was the only eyewitness to her landing. Throughout her flying career, Earhart demonstrated an interest in breaking aviation records. She had long felt that the publicity she received after the 1928 flight outweighed her actual achievement, and she saw this solo flight as the opportunity to prove her flying ability and her mettle. Setting out from Newfoundland in a Lockheed Vega, she encountered strong winds and icy conditions. Her goal was to match Lindbergh’s feat and land in Paris, but after a fifteen-hour flight beset with mechanical problems, she decided to touch down when she encountered terra firma, landing safely in northwestern Ireland. Upon greeting her, McCallon asked, ""Have you flown far?"" Earhart answered, ""From America."""
113530,"After her second transatlantic flight, Earhart continued to set out on record-breaking trips. Only two months after returning to America in June 1932, she became the first woman to fly solo across the North American continent and back. She also found time for other projects, especially those that advanced women’s progress in society. During this period she became close friends with first lady Eleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962). The two women shared a similar sense of independence and supported each other’s causes. Inspired by Earhart’s example, Roosevelt wanted to obtain a pilot’s license, although her husband rejected the idea. Earhart was a frequent visitor to the White House and was likewise influenced by Roosevelt. She supported the first lady’s efforts to improve the lives of working women and joined her campaign to promote world peace."
113534,"A late photograph of Amelia Earhart    To locate tiny Howland Island, Earhart and Fred Noonan expected to communicate with the Itasca, a United States Coast Guard cutter that President Roosevelt agreed to locate near the island for assistance. Although the cutter received messages, at first faint but then clearer and stronger, communication ultimately failed. Upon learning that the pair had not arrived, Roosevelt ordered a massive sea and air search that went on for more than two weeks. When that search was terminated, George Putnam underwrote his own search that lasted until October. Newspapers around the globe covered the search on a nearly daily basis. Yet as time elapsed, hope for their safe recovery faded. In 1939, a probate court in Los Angeles declared Earhart legally dead. Neither the plane nor the bodies of the two pilots have ever been recovered."
113823,"On August 25th the National Portrait Gallery put on display in the gallery devoted to recent history a piece of twisted metal taken from the wreckage of the World Trade Center, destroyed in the attack of September 11, 2001.     The Portrait Gallery obtained this remnant of that tragic day from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey which has ownership of the World Trade Center site and is currently building a replacement for the Twin Towers which will include a memorial and a museum. As the site’s custodian, the Port Authority makes grants of the debris to locales and institutions wishing to commemorate and memorialize 9/11.    About the grant of this small piece of history to the National Portrait Gallery, the Port Authority’s executive director Chris Ward said: “In our effort to find appropriate, permanent sites for artifacts recovered from the World Trade Center following the attacks on September 11, 2001, we are honored that the National Portrait Gallery has agreed to display an artifact from the WTC. Its presence at the Smithsonian Institution will serve as a powerful reminder of the unspeakable losses suffered that day and be a simple yet moving memorial.”   "

Reynolds Center for American Art and Portraiture. A workman had started a fire on the first floor after copyists complained of being cold. Sparks traveled up a flue and ignited a series of wooden grates on the roof. In the next several hours, flames spread quickly throughout the third floor’s north and west wings.

Also housed in the building were the Declaration of Independence, George Washington’s military uniform, and many other items of national importance. Fortunately, a brigade of rescuers saved them—together with most of the written records and drawings from the Patent Office. These four photographs were taken not long after the fire and provide a graphic account of the fire’s destruction."
114304,"Born Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  Henry Ossawa Tanner was one of the first African American artists to gain international acclaim, winning honors in both America and Europe. The son of an African Methodist Episcopal bishop, Tanner studied painting in Philadelphia under the guidance of Thomas Eakins and Thomas Hovenden at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Much of his work was devoted to carefully rendered depictions of biblical scenes, landscapes, and the everyday lives of African Americans. While his paintings won praise from some quarters, he endured many slights because of his race, and in 1891 he left America to continue his studies in Paris. Tanner found greater tolerance abroad, and although he returned to the States periodically, he spent the remainder of his life in France.              This portrait by Frederick Gutekunst was probably created during a visit to Philadelphia in 1897. Tanner’s success served as an inspiration for African American artists during the Harlem Renaissance and later."
114305,"Left to right: George ""Rube"" Foster (1888–1976), Carl Mays (1891–1971), Ernest ""Ernie"" Shore (1891–1980), George Herman ""Babe"" Ruth (1895–1948), and Hubert Benjamin ""Dutch"" Leonard (1892–1952)   When signed by the Boston Red Sox in 1914, the thin, muscular 6’2"" Babe Ruth was a gifted pitcher. In 1915 he established himself as a star with an 18–8 win-loss record and a 2.44 ERA. The next year, his league-leading nine shutouts and 1.75 ERA helped the Red Sox repeat as world champions. Wartime restrictions shortened the 1918 season and thinned the ranks of players. (As a married man, Ruth was not drafted.) Ruth played the outfield as well as pitched, responding with a 13–7 record; he was also tied for a league-leading eleven home runs. His two shutouts in the 1918 World Series set a record for scoreless innings that stood until 1961. During 1919, his last season with the Red Sox, he gave up pitching to become a full-time outfielder. By that time, he had compiled an 89–46 win-loss record with a 2.28 ERA, leaving little doubt he could have been one of baseball’s greatest pitchers."
114622,"Born near Alexandria, Alabama     In the spring of 1861, John Pelham abruptly left West Point to offer his services to the newly formed Confederacy and soon landed in Virginia as a lieutenant in the artillery. The boyish-looking officer repeatedly demonstrated the effectiveness of his “horse artillery” at the battles of Antietam and Fredericksburg, winning high praise from his superiors, Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, and Robert E. Lee. “It is really extraordinary,” Jackson wrote in 1862, “to find such nerve and genius in a mere boy.” Pelham was mortally wounded in a cavalry engagement at Kelly’s Ford, Virginia, in March 1863. "
114822,"Born Duncan, Oklahoma   Jeane J. Kirkpatrick was the first woman to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. Nominated by Ronald Reagan in 1981, she held this position for four years, although she was a Democrat. Kirkpatrick caught Reagan’s attention with her hard-line anti-communism policies. She actively backed his presidential bid and helped him prepare for his televised debates with President Jimmy Carter. As ambassador to the U.N., Kirkpatrick defended the Reagan administration’s efforts to improve relations with authoritarian military regimes in Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, and Brazil. After her tenure ended in 1985, Kirkpatrick became a Republican favorite and officially switched her party affiliation. Returning to teach at Georgetown University, Kirkpatrick was actively engaged in politics until her death. This portrait shows her outside the U.N. building in New York City."
114823,"Born Ceylon, Minnesota  In his 1984 bid for the White House, Walter Mondale chose Congresswoman Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running-mate on the Democratic ticket. Ferraro was the first woman nominated for the vice presidency by a major political party. The two campaigned on a liberal platform, favoring both a nuclear freeze and the Equal Rights Amendment. Mondale had previously served as Jimmy Carter’s vice president. Ferraro was a former prosecutor in New York who had first run for Congress in 1978 under the campaign slogan “Finally, a tough Democrat.” Although Mondale and Ferraro did well in the popular vote, they lost to incumbent Ronald Reagan."
114826,"Born New York City  Admired for her candor and down-to-earth approach to public life, Barbara Bush enjoyed considerable popularity as the nation’s first lady during the presidency of her husband, George H. W. Bush (1989–93). Just sixteen when she met the future president in 1941, she married him four years later and embarked on a life that would include raising five children, one of whom, George W. Bush, became the forty-third president. During her tenure as first lady, Bush championed efforts to combat illiteracy. In 1989 she established the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy and later directed proceeds from the publication of Millie’s Book—a behind-the-scenes look at White House life from the perspective of the Bush family’s beloved springer spaniel—to fund literacy initiatives. The first lady and Millie appear together in this photograph, which was taken on the White House grounds. "
114828,"Born Bayonne, New Jersey  The first member of Congress to publicly reveal his homosexuality, Barney Frank represented the Fourth District of Massachusetts in the House of Representatives from 1981 until his retirement in 2013. The district has an interesting combination of middle- and working-class elements, and Frank was able to win elections with large majorities of the vote because of his attention to constituent needs.  Frank is a classic wisecracking Boston politician, able to give as good as he gets in debates and interchanges with the public; he was widely recognized as one of the smarter minds in Congress. Frank also has had a national presence, not only as a gay man and as a spokesman for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, but most recently for his work on the American Housing Reserve and Foreclosure Prevention Act."
114832,"This photograph was taken in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol before the luncheon that Congress hosts following the swearing-in of the new president and vice president. Al Gore was both the outgoing vice president and the defeated Democratic candidate for president. He had been defeated by Bush in one of the closest and most hotly contested elections in American history. The results hinged on disputed ballots cast in Florida, and the debate and ideas on how to resolve it had gone on since the polls closed on Election Day. After a series of political and court challenges that ultimately involved the U.S. Supreme Court, the Republican ticket was declared the winner in Florida. On December 13, 2000, Gore conceded the presidency to Bush. "
114834,"Ronald Reagan loved humorous stories, using them as Abraham Lincoln did: to illustrate a serious point in an engaging way, or to deflect anger and disarm an antagonist, or sometimes simply for enjoyment. He had the State Department collect anti-Soviet jokes circulating among opposition groups and repeated them to Mikail Gorbachev, much to the Soviet leader’s annoyance. However, Gorbachev is said to have enjoyed the following one:  During a time when the Moscow police were cracking down on speeding, an emergency meeting was called at the Kremlin. Gorbachev, racing to his car, grabbed the keys from his driver. They roared by a speed trap and a policeman took after the car, but did not issue a ticket, later explaining to his partner that there was a very important person in the car. “Who?” his partner asked. “I don’t know, but he must have been important because Gorbachev was driving.”                   This photograph was taken in the Oval Office on March 3, 1981—six weeks after Reagan was inaugurated—at the time of his interview by Walter Cronkite.   "
114835,"Born San Francisco, California     The visionary co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs was today’s version of an earlier era’s Thomas Edison: beginning with the MacIntosh computer, his innovations generated a cultural revolution in everyday life. In 1976 he and Steve Wozniak founded Apple and began producing personal computers. After losing a power struggle in 1985, Jobs left Apple and later acquired Pixar Animation Studios, where he produced a string of films such as Toy Story. He returned to Apple in 1996 and launched an era of extraordinary inventiveness. With spellbinding showmanship, Jobs set out to “make a dent in the universe,” and over the next several years introduced the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad—products that transformed the consumer electronics industry. His entrepreneurship stressed design, and Apple products are known for their functional elegance.   Jobs once said: “Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. . . . Design is how it works.”"
114840,"Born New York City  As first lady from 1981 to 1989, Nancy Reagan sought to heighten the style and glamour of White House events, much as Jacqueline Kennedy had done twenty years earlier. Like other first ladies, Reagan also chose worthy causes to endorse. She lent her support to the Foster Grandparent Program and in 1982 launched her “Just Say No” campaign to fight youth drug abuse and to support drug rehabilitation programs. While President Ronald Reagan was in France in 1982 to attend the economic summit conference held at Versailles, the first lady commemorated the thirty-eighth anniversary of the Allied invasion of Europe by visiting Omaha Beach Memorial Cemetery in Normandy. In this photograph, she stoops to place flowers on a grave in remembrance of the American G.I.s who lost their lives storming the beaches on D-Day in 1944. "
114913,"Born Chester, Pennsylvania  Singer and actress Ethel Waters toured the South and Midwest as a young performer on the black vaudeville circuit and moved to New York in the 1920s. She enjoyed critical success during the Harlem Renaissance, recorded popular blues songs, and starred on Broadway throughout the 1930s. Her friend Antonio Salemme sculpted a clay version of this bust in summer 1927, after the Broadway musical Africana opened, featuring the ""statuesque"" Waters. She reflected that Salemme’s bust ""brought out much of what I’d been like as a girl and was now like as a woman."""
114939,"This broadside, published in January 1812 after the special session of Congress called by President Madison to consider war against Great Britain, warns other nations not to interfere in American commerce and affirms the power of ""the First Great Western Empire: or, the United States of America.""

114992,"Born Oakland, California     Fred T. Korematsu fought a lifelong struggle to right an injustice that the United States government brought upon thousands of Japanese American citizens. Korematsu was a welder on the Oakland docks before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066, authorizing West Coast military commanders to issue whatever orders they thought were necessary for national security. The relocation of Japanese Americans into internment camps soon followed. Korematsu defied the order, was sent to federal prison, and later joined his family in a detention center. Korematsu, with the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union, challenged the legality of the detention, but it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1944. In 1983 he petitioned to reopen the case, arguing that the government knew that Japanese Americans were not a security threat. A lower court found in his favor, and his conviction was overturned. In 1988 Congress apologized for the internments and awarded each survivor $20,000. "

115004,"Born Akron, Ohio  LeBron James was the number-one pick of the 2003 NBA draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. During his years with the Cavaliers, he galvanized a previously mediocre franchise, leading the team deep into the playoffs. A seven-time All-Star, James was also the league’s MVP in the 2008–9, 2009–10, and 2011–12 seasons. He won a bronze medal at the 2004 Olympics and a gold medal in 2008. As a free agent in 2012, several cities and teams began wooing James. After a few frantic weeks, he signed with the Miami Heat.  Photographer Michael O’Brien captured several images of James during his senior year of high school in his hometown of Akron for a 2002 issue of ESPN: The Magazine. This photograph landed on the cover of the magazine, and was taken just prior to a practice in James’s high school gym."
115039,"Born Reading, Pennsylvania  Artist Keith Haring stands before Unfinished Painting (1989), one of the last works he completed before his death from the AIDS virus. The painting serves as a poignant statement about a life cut short at the age of thirty-one. In this and other works during a meteoric career that lasted just over a decade, Haring demonstrated a commitment to various political and social causes, including apartheid, nuclear disarmament, and especially the AIDS crisis. He vaulted to public prominence initially as a graffiti artist whose comical and enigmatic cartoons started appearing in New York City’s subway system. This success led him to mainstream fame in the art world. Although some critics expressed concern about his efforts to market his work to a mass audience, Haring believed that art should be as accessible as possible: ""You can’t just stay in your studio and paint; that’s not the most effective way to communicate."""
115066,"Born near Oologah, Oklahoma     Will Rogers was the child of Cherokee parents; his father was prominent in Oklahoma politics. Rogers, however, lived the life of a cowboy before discovering his gifts as a humorist, actor, and commentator on social mores and politics. Rogers’s biographer has noted that of all the myths surrounding the humorist’s phenomenal success, none conflicted with reality more than the myth of his ignorance. Rogers used his wit and intellect to entertain and to cultivate the persona of a naive cowboy who commented on and often “roasted” pretentious, self-styled sophisticates. Rogers was killed in a plane crash on August 15, 1935, at the peak of his fame as a radio and movie star and newspaper columnist.  Few portraitists captured Rogers from life. One of those was Charles Banks Wilson, who at age fifteen sketched Rogers backstage after a performance in Miami, Oklahoma. He created this painting from those sketches. "
115067,"Born Newark, New Jersey  Savion Glover first performed on Broadway when he was ten, in The Tap Dance Kid. He has rooted his style firmly in the tradition forged by the great tappers of the past—the Nicholas Brothers, Jimmy Slyde, Honi Coles—but he has added his own sense of funk that is squarely based on contemporary life.  Glover describes his tap as “hittin’,” and it’s all about his feet, which are his drums. His left heel is his bass drum, his right a tom-tom: “I can get a snare out of my right toe, a whip sound. . . . And if I want cymbals, crash crash, that’s landing flat, both feet.”  In his choreography for the Tony Award–winning Bring in ’Da Noise, Bring in ’Da Funk, he chronicled how dance expressed African American identity, from slavery to rap. For Glover, dance is all about “communicating, getting on the floor the rhythm you live by.” "
115079,"Born Springfield, Massachusetts  Known as “the Queen of Tap,” Eleanor Powell was a forceful and exuberant dancer. Fred Astaire said, “She really knocked out a tap dance in a class by herself.”  Powell starred in Broadway Melody of 1936, Born to Dance, Rosalie, Broadway Melody of 1938, and, most notably, Broadway Melody of 1940. Her production number with Astaire in that last film, “Begin the Beguine,” is considered one of the most legendary tap sequences ever filmed. Dancing on a giant mirror that reflected an infinite starscape, they elevated the dance into an other-worldly space.  Powell called tap “our American folk dance. It is the red, white, and blue.” For her, the rhythmic beat of tap made it “the uniquely American contribution to the world of dance.”"
115109,"Mohongo (Sacred Sun, c. 1789–1836), Washingsabba (Black Bird, 1795–1829?), and Big Soldier (1773?–1844) were three members of an Osage delegation that traveled to Europe in 1827. Organized by Frenchman David Delaunay, who profited from exhibiting them as an exotic attraction, they were received with enthusiasm at the French court of Charles X. Over time, as interest faded, Delaunay was imprisoned due to mounting debts and the Osage were abandoned and forced to fend for themselves. During this time, Mohongo gave birth to twin daughters, one of whom she allowed to be adopted into a French family. The press became reinvested, which spurred the Marquis de Lafayette to raise funds for their return journey.  This lithograph reflects what Europeans found exotic about the Osage. Newspaper articles referenced their “reddish-copper skin,” colorful costumes complete with feathers and jewelry, and the red streak applied in the center part of Mohongo’s hair.     Mohongo (Sol Sagrado, c. 1789–1836), Washingsabba (Ave Negra, 1795–1829?) y Soldado Grande (1773?–1844) eran tres integrantes de una delegación de la tribu Osage que viajó a Europa en 1827. El viaje fue organizado por el francés David Delaunay, quien se lucró de exhibirlos como una atracción exótica. Fueron recibidos con entusiasmo en la corte francesa de Carlos X. Con el tiempo, a medida que el interés menguó, Delaunay fue encarcelado por sus crecientes deudas y los osage fueron abandonados y forzados a arreglárselas solos. Durante este tiempo, Mohongo dio a luz gemelas y permitió que una de ellas fuera adoptada por una familia francesa. La prensa se volvió a interesar en los indígenas, lo cual motivó al marqués de Lafayette a recaudar fondos para su viaje de regreso.  Esta litografía refleja lo que los europeos encontraban exótico en los osage. Los artículos periodísticos mencionaban su “piel roja-cobriza”, su vestuario colorido con plumas y joyas, y la raya roja aplicada en la partidura del cabello de Mohongo.Asma Naeem   "
115114,"Born Newark, New Jersey  Burt Silverman’s drawing of Philip Roth—made when the artist visited Roth in his Connecticut home in 1983—is a supple manipulation of charcoal and chalk. It shows Roth, hailed as one of America’s greatest living novelists, as a preoccupied man with a piercing gaze, an elegant visual analogy for Roth’s probing, transgressive writing style.   Roth burst onto the national stage in 1959 with his incisive portrayal of Jewish American subjects in Goodbye, Columbus, for which he won his first National Book Award. He went on to win his second in 1995 for Sabbath’s Theater, followed by the Pulitzer Prize two years later for American Pastoral. In the midst of such accolades came harsh criticism for his 1969 novel, Portnoy’s Complaint, a groundbreaking work for its explicit treatment of sexuality. Undaunted by his detractors, Roth has never veered from his candid, sardonic voice."
115115,"Born Greenville, Mississippi     Creator of the irrepressible Muppets, Jim Henson was just out of high school when he began creating puppets for local Washington, D.C., television shows in the 1950s. Henson experimented with various techniques to create an expressive performance, using soft materials instead of wood or papier mâche to produce flexible facial expressions. Using the television screen as his stage, he employed close-up shots to connect audiences with his characters. Henson’s Muppets first reached a national TV audience in the 1960s, with numerous variety show appearances, but it was their featured role on the educational children’s program Sesame Street (launched in 1969) and their star turn on The Muppet Show (1976–81) that made them a popular phenomenon. Although the Muppet cast includes such memorable characters such Miss Piggy, Big Bird, and the Cookie Monster, Henson was most closely identified with the lovable and chipper Kermit the Frog, for whom he provided both voice and animation."
115122,"Born Falmouth, Kentucky  Phillip Sharp raised cattle on the family farm to earn money to attend Union College. After graduate study at the University of Illinois and postdoctoral work at Cal Tech, he moved in 1971 to the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. By 1974 he was director of the Center for Cancer Research (now the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There, his work focuses on the molecular biology of tumor viruses and the mechanisms of RNA splicing. In 1993, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Richard J. Roberts for the discovery of RNA splicing. His findings have helped scientists understand more about the genetic causes of cancer and other diseases. Sharp received the National Medal of Science in 2006."
115215,"Born Chester, Pennsylvania     Beginning as a blues singer on the black vaudeville circuit while still in her teens, Ethel Waters later made her way to Harlem, where she entertained at the Cotton Club and other nightspots. From the mid-1920s to early 1930s she appeared in all-black revues before moving to mainstream musicals with her performance in Irving Berlin’s As Thousands Cheer (1933). Waters became the first African American actress to play a dramatic lead on Broadway with her role in Mamba’s Daughters (1939). She ultimately appeared in more than a dozen Broadway productions and nine films, including Cabin in the Sky (1943) and The Member of the Wedding (1952).  African American artist Beauford Delaney first gained a reputation in New York City in the 1930s with distinctive pastel portraits like this image of Waters, who was a particular favorite. Delaney and his protégé, James Baldwin, would often listen to, and sing along with, her music."
115222,"Born New York City  Steve Weinberg is one of the most important American physicists of the recent past. While on the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, Weinberg did groundbreaking research in the field of particle physics, investigating such topics as pion scattering, infrared photons, and quantum gravity. This work informed his subsequent books, Gravitation and Cosmology (1972) and The Quantum Theory of Fields (1995). In 1967 he left Berkeley and, as a visiting professor at MIT, did what became his most influential work, proposing a model of unification of electromagnetism and of nuclear weak forces. In 1979, after experiments confirmed his theory, Weinberg—together with Abdus Salam and Sheldon Glashow—were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics. Created to accompany a recent profile of Weinberg for Scientific American magazine, this photograph shows the physicist in his office at the University of Texas at Austin."
115404,"Born Denison, Texas  In 1948, George Sands of New York City arranged for Jo Davidson to make a portrait from life of Dwight D. Eisenhower. The general, who was just leaving the army to become president of Columbia University, was pleased to sit for the amiable artist; a friend noted that the final work captured ""his force, vitality and human understanding."" Two full-size busts were cast, one for the West Point Museum and one for the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst in England. Davidson created this small reduction for his patron; another reduction was made as a gift for General Eisenhower."
115505,"Born Florence, Italy  Italian merchant and explorer Amerigo Vespucci made several voyages to what is now Brazil in the early sixteenth century; America is named after him. Thomas Jefferson considered Vespucci to be one of four ""first discoverers"" whose portraits should be preserved in the United States. In 1787, he commissioned copies of portraits of Vespucci, Christopher Columbus, Hernando Cortés, and Ferdinand Magellan that were in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy. Other Americans followed suit, making copies of these portraits to augment the historical record. During the winter of 1816, artist and museum-keeper Charles Willson Peale, who wanted copies of these four ""noted voyagers"" for his collection of portraits in Philadelphia, borrowed paintings owned by diplomat and poet Joel Barlow and created this portrait. It remained in Peale’s museum until 1854 and still retains its original frame."
115506,"Born San Francisco, California  Leon Fleisher carved out a brilliant concert and recording career before his right hand became disabled in 1965. Thereafter, he concentrated on the left-hand repertory and also established a successful conducting career. He has also excelled as a teacher. Fleisher joined the faculty of the Peabody Conservatory of Music in 1959 and later held the Andrew W. Mellon Chair in piano. In 1985 he became artistic director of the Tanglewood Music Center. In 1995, Fleisher regained the use of his right hand and now plays a limited repertoire of bimanual works and continues to perform works for the left hand. His portraitist, Paul Wyse, is also a classically trained concert pianist. In 2009, Wyse observed Fleisher conducting the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra of New York in rehearsal while sitting amid the orchestra; the resulting sketches formed the basis for this painting."

115526,"Born Brooklyn, New York  Rudolph Giuliani made his reputation in New York City as a tough-talking, hard-charging federal attorney, famous for the public visibility of his campaigns against both muggers on the street and financial analysts on Wall Street. Giuliani parlayed his six years as a prosecutor into a political career, serving as Republican mayor of New York from 1994 to 2001. He portrayed himself as a mayor who would make the city safe, livable, and workable again after years of drift under liberal governance. While he remains a controversial figure in New York politics, he vaulted to national prominence when he projected calmness and control in the midst of the chaos of the destruction of the World Trade Center’s twin towers. His handling of 9/11 led some to dub him ""America’s mayor""; he was also named Time magazine’s ""Person of the Year"" for 2001."
115585,"To date, Mortimer M. Caplin’s life has been one of high energy and accomplishment. Nationally known for more than fifty years as one of Washington’s foremost tax attorneys, the New York City–born Caplin has been a self-driven achiever since his early days. A member of Phi Beta Kappa as an undergraduate at the University of Virginia, he later finished first in his law school class. He would teach tax law at UVA’s law school for thirty-three years. In 1964, he founded the Washington law firm Caplin & Drysdale and is still practicing today.  Time magazine commissioned this portrait for its February 1, 1963, cover. The accompanying story reported on Caplin’s expertise as the commissioner of internal revenue and his great influence on President John Kennedy’s proposed tax reforms."
115586,"The War of 1812 was the first fighting opportunity for a new generation of soldiers and a launching pad for many long military careers. Zachary Taylor joined the army in 1808. During the War of 1812 he was most noted for his defense of Fort Harrison (in present-day Indiana) against Indian attack. Although his service was not distinguished, Taylor was steadily promoted, and by the time of the Mexican American War, ""Old Rough and Ready"" was second in rank only to Winfield Scott. Taylor’s victory over Santa Anna at Buena Vista made him a hero, and supporters rallied around him as a presidential candidate. "
115592,"In a speech delivered in Fulton, Missouri, in 1946, which marked a rhetorical beginning of the Cold War, Winston Churchill made his famous reference to a metaphorical “Iron Curtain” descending across the European continent. On June 8, 1982, President Reagan, addressing the British Parliament, spoke of a real concrete and barbed-wire reality. At this dividing line reaching from “Stettin on the Baltic to Varna on the Black Sea,” NATO forces faced “east to prevent a possible invasion,” and on the “other side of the line, the Soviet forces also face[d] east to prevent their people from leaving.”    "
115593,"The Berlin Wall had been up for more than twenty-five years when President Reagan gave his famous speech at the Brandenburg Gate on June 12, 1987. He was acutely sensitive to the wall’s symbolism of Cold War divisions and tensions. By making the removal of the Berlin Wall a litmus test for General Secretary Gorbachev’s seriousness about making “profound changes in the Soviet state,” Reagan had increased the pressure on the Soviet leader. The most famous line in the speech—“Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall”— had been deleted several times by the State Department until Reagan insisted that it remain.    "
115607,"Born Yorkshire, England   Benjamin Latrobe was the most important architect of the early republic, transforming the discipline from an avocation for amateurs to a profession with standards and practices. Latrobe trained several of America’s next generation of architects, including the designer of this building, Robert Mills. Born in England, Latrobe trained there and in Germany. He but we know little of Latrobe’s early work because his records were lost at sea when he immigrated to America in 1795–96. His influential American buildings include the Philadelphia Water Works, New York City Hall, and redesigns of the Capitol and White House after they were burned in the War of 1812. Latrobe and artist Charles Frederick von Breda were at the beginning of their careers in London when this portrait was made. Von Breda created it to recall the lively and successful composition of a larger painting now in the collection of the Maryland Historical Society."
115614,"As an artist, Roger Shimomura (born 1939) has focused particular attention on the experiences of Asian Americans and the challenges of being “different” in America. He knows well the pain and embarrassment associated with xenophobia: as a small child during World War II, he and his family were relocated from their home in Seattle to a Japanese American internment camp in Idaho.  This painting takes as its source Emanuel Leutze’s 1851 painting Washington Crossing the Delaware, which is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. Shimomura presents himself in the guise of America’s Founding Father; he replaces George Washington’s colonial troops with samurai warriors; and he remakes the body of water they cross to resemble San Francisco Harbor with Angel Island (the processing center for Asian immigrants) in the background. The work echoes the compositional format of a Katsushika Hokusai wood-block print."
115632,"Robert Lowell’s family was descended from Puritans, and he developed a sense of ironic distance on his past to make himself into America’s foremost history poet. Lowell reflected on his Puritan inheritance more deeply than anyone since Nathaniel Hawthorne. His vision was dark; he maintained that behind the American character stood the figures of the Devil and Captain Ahab. A sense of obsession and agony fills many of his poems; in his account of Jonathan Edwards, ""After the Surprising Conversions,"" he writes, ""God / Abandoned us to Satan, and he pressed / Us hard. . . . / Content was gone. / All the good work was quashed. We were undone."" The weight of Lowell’s inheritance (plus his fragile emotional state) did not break him. Instead, throughout the 1950s his writing loosened up, and his work became more intimate and personal. This transition spawned the idea of ""confessional"" verse, a style that increasingly fit the temper of the times"
115635,"Born New York City  This picture of the New York City television reporter Lou Young was taken after the attacks on the World Trade Center (WTC) buildings. Young is standing at an intersection adjacent to the WTC site where the media congregated for their stand-up reports from the scene. Young, who worked for the CBS affiliate in the city, is gathering himself as he prepares to go back on the air. His pose evokes a sense of resolution combined with fatigue and incomprehension that encapsulated the national mood in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks."
115636,"Born Guangzhou, China   Moon Kwan was a pivotal figure in the development of the Chinese film industry who began his career in Hollywood during American cinema’s formative years. A native of China, Kwan initially moved to San Francisco before moving to Los Angeles in 1915 to pursue his interest in filmmaking. He found work as a writer and actor but made his principal contribution as an advisor on Chinese culture to director D.W. Griffith during the filming of the silent classic Broken Blossoms (1919). Returning to China in 1921, Kwan established a film company near Shanghai and later taught acting and scriptwriting in Hong Kong. In 1933 he co-founded the Grandview Film Company in San Francisco to make Chinese-language films for the American market. After opening a branch of the company in Hong Kong in 1935, Kwan directed more than fifty films there while continuing to promote and distribute Chinese films in the United States."
115637,"In the early hours of May 13, 1862, Robert Smalls made a dramatic escape from slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and delivering it safely into the hands of the U.S. Navy. As an enslaved worker in Charleston, South Carolina, Smalls became a skilled deckhand and wheelman aboard the Planter, a cotton steamer that was converted into a Confederate transport vessel in 1861. Determined to make a bid for freedom, Smalls and his enslaved shipmates absconded with the Planter after the ship’s white captain and crew went ashore for the night. Under cover of darkness, Smalls and his men picked up several family members before guiding the Planter safely past Confederate positions and handing over the vessel to the commander of the Union blockading squadron, positioned just outside Charleston Harbor. Hailed as a hero in the North, Smalls received a monetary award from Congress and later served as the Planter’s pilot after it became a Union gunship. "
115704,"Born Monterrey, Mexico  Known as the “King of the Accordion,” Ramón Ayala has exemplified for more than five decades the best of norteño music, a genre rooted in rural Mexico and popular throughout the Southwest. Having started playing the accordion at age five, Ayala recorded his first album at age eighteen with the group Los Relámpagos del Norte—the Lightning Bolts of the North—and was soon regarded as one of the most inventive musicians in the norteño tradition. Now based in Hidalgo, Texas, he has recorded more than a hundred albums and is the recipient of four Grammy Awards. His songs are often concerned with the hopes and dreams of immigrants along the U.S.–Mexico border, although his music is also about conveying sentiments that speak to the heart of humanity. In this portrait—commissioned to accompany a profile of the legendary musician for Texas Monthly—photographer Jeff Wilson captures Ayala holding his signature rhinestone-studded accordion."
115705,"Born the Bronx, New York  Known for his spare, hallucinatory treatments of contemporary society, Don DeLillo is one of America’s most important recent writers. Turning to fiction after an early career in advertising, DeLillo published six novels between 1971 and 1978. Not until White Noise (1985), however, did he reach a wide audience and satisfy his own high standards. White Noise won the National Book Award and has since been cited as a major work of postmodernism. DeLillo followed up with Libra (1988), a fictional biography of Lee Harvey Oswald. The themes of violence, terror, and paranoia that pervaded these two books coalesced in DeLillo’s monumental Underworld (1997), a multicharacter, multiplotted novel about the Cold War era. His Falling Man (2007) was one of the first novels about 9/11."
115708,"Patrick Swayze’s role as Johnny Castle in Dirty Dancing (1987) was a breakthrough performance in a movie that became a massive surprise hit. Trained in both gymnastics and classical ballet, Swayze (1952–2009)—shown here with costar Jennifer Gray—had a supercharged grace that helped catapult Dirty Dancing into the box-office stratosphere. The New York Times called the movie “a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963—orderly, prosperous, bursting with good intentions.” It earned more than $10 million in the first ten days of its release.  Propelled by Swayze’s electrifying performance, Dirty Dancing brought movie musicals back onto the popular-culture radar screen. It became the first film to sell a million copies on video, and won both a Grammy and an Oscar for the song “The Time of My Life.” In 1991, People magazine selected Swayze “the Sexiest Man Alive.”"
115711,"Born Saint Louis, Missouri  An inaugural inductee of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986, Chuck Berry is credited with revolutionizing the music scene of the 1950s. He was a major influence on the emergence of rock and roll, blending lyrics about cars, women, and teenage life with the driving combination of rhythm and blues and country and western music. Known for his showmanship on stage and his guitar solos, Berry set the standard for rock performers. A special feature of this work is the imagined ""Maybellene,"" who stands on the neck of the guitar at the center. According to the artist, Red Grooms, he ""gave the great Rock and Roller the futurist treatment and made sure the color scheme would work in any cool cat’s parlor."""
115715,"Born Oceanside, New York     Most cancers, in the opinion of virologist Harold Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute since 2010, “will become chronic disorders that we take care of and sometimes cure.” Varmus has been thinking about the complexities of the disease for most of his career. In 1989 he and his research partner J. Michael Bishop won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their studies on the genetic basis of cancers and the role of viruses in their formation. Both as an award-winning scientist and as a high-level administrator—he also served as director of the National Institutes of Health and president of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center—Varmus has mobilized global cooperation and advanced research on cancer and its potential cures. Jon Friedman’s oil sketch, a study for a Sloan-Kettering portrait commission, conveys Varmus’s informality as well as a direct and animated interaction with the viewer.    Harold Varmus  nacido en 1939  Nacido en Oceanside, Nueva York     La mayoría de los tipos de cáncer, opina el virólogo Harold Varmus, director del Instituto Nacional del Cáncer desde 2010, “se convertirán en condiciones crónicas que podremos manejar y a veces hasta curar”. Varmus ha ponderado las complejidades de esta enfermedad a lo largo de su carrera. En 1989, junto a su compañero investigador J. Michael Bishop, recibió el Premio Nobel de Medicina por sus estudios sobre las bases genéticas del cáncer y la función de los virus en su formación. Como galardonado científico y administrador de alto nivel (también dirigió los Institutos Nacionales de la Salud y presidió el Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center), Varmus ha movilizado esfuerzos mundiales de cooperación e investigación del cáncer y sus posibles curas. Este boceto al óleo de Jon Friedman, un estudio para un retrato comisionado por Sloan-Kettering, nos comunica la actitud cordial y sencilla de Varmus, como si sostuviera una animada conversación con los espectadores.

115716,"Born Chestertown, Maryland   Thomas L. McKenney was one of the most important figures in setting and implementing early governmental policy toward American Indians. He was superintendent of Indian trade from 1816 to 1822 and later superintendent of Indian affairs (1824–30), a position created in the War Department. McKenney sought to integrate, or at least reconcile, Indians with American culture through education. He helped secure the passage of the Indian Civilization Act of 1819 and, more ominously, the Indian Removal Act (1830), which confiscated Indian lands and forced tribes to relocate west of the Mississippi. McKenney claimed that the brutality of the “Trail of Tears” was due to the callousness of President Andrew Jackson, not his fault or that of the bureau. Jackson fired McKenney for insubordination. While in office, McKenney initiated a major ethnological project, collecting books, manuscripts, artifacts, and paintings to document the history of the North American Indians. "
115777,"Jim Brown was the most dominant running back in NFL history, the first black action hero, and a star of blaxploitation films. Brown’s signature stylistic move on the field combined power, personal style, and racial dignity: after a running play, he walked back to the huddle with a cool, exaggerated slowness, underscoring his value to the team and his indestructibility. It was an act of cultural politics, football played through the prism of Black Power, and it forced white Americans ""to accept the modern Black athlete on his own terms,"" as one sportswriter reflected. Brown carried the same swagger into 1970s films such as Black Gunn, Slaughter, and Three the Hard Way. In 2002 Sporting News voted him the greatest professional football player of all time. This photograph captures his defiant mettle just moments after the Cleveland Browns won the 1964 NFL championship."
115778,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  The Philadelphia-born social realist artist George Biddle was a strong advocate of government support for the arts. With the backing of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a former classmate at Groton School, Biddle helped organize the Public Works of Art Project, which led to the formation of the Federal Art Project, a program of the Works Progress Administration. Among the thousands of artworks the program produced was Biddle’s own mural, The Tenement, which he completed for the U.S. Department of Justice’s building in Washington. During World War II, Biddle presided as chairman over the War Department’s Art Advisory Committee, and in 1950 he was appointed to the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts. These portraits of Biddle and his wife, Belgian-born sculptor Hélène Sardeau, were drawn by their close friend Marguerite Zorach shortly after their 1931 marriage. They are a gift from the Biddles’ son."
115779,"Born Antwerp, Belgium  Belgian-born artist Hélène Sardeau, who moved to New York as a young teenager, first gained attention while still in art school with a series of expressive, long-limbed doll portraits of actors and socialites modeled from life. Rudolf Valentino ordered 160 of his portrait dolls to display in movie theaters, and the press took notice. Subsequently Sardeau focused her career primarily on sculpture and large-scale bas-reliefs and her work was exhibited around the country and abroad. Vanity Fair editor Frank Crowninshield praised her ability ""to combine the classical form with modern thought and modern sensibility.""  Marguerite Zorach’s striking pencil portraits of friends and family, with their broad, stylized faces and almost surreal emphasis on heavily outlined oval eyes, suggest the influence of both Henri Matisse and Diego Rivera, whose work she would have seen during her early studies in Paris."
115814,"This 1936 photograph—featuring eight of the nine Scottsboro Boys with NAACP representatives Juanita Jackson Mitchell, Laura Kellum, and Dr. Ernest W. Taggart—was taken inside the prison where the Scottsboro Boys were being held. Falsely accused of raping two white women aboard a freight train in 1931, the nine African American teenagers were tried in Scottsboro, Alabama, in what became a sensational case attracting national attention. Eight of the defendants were found guilty and sentenced to death; the trial of the ninth ended in a mistrial. These verdicts were widely condemned at the time. Before the young men eventually won their freedom, they would endure many years in prison and face numerous retrials and hearings. The ninth member of the group, Roy Wright, refused to pose for this portrait on account of his frustration with the slow pace of their legal battle."
115899,"In a prolific yet short-lived career, Jean-Michel Basquiat became a leading figure in the 1980s art world. Having run away from home as a teenager, he supported himself initially by selling homemade postcards and sweatshirts on the street. He emerged as an underground celebrity in 1978, when he and a friend began spray-painting cryptic social messages and the tag SAMO (short for ""Same Old Shit"") all over Lower Manhattan. Working in a graffiti style, he moved into producing artworks that combined expressively drawn elements like figures and skulls with incisive words and phrases. Soon he was exhibiting at major galleries and museums and collaborating with Andy Warhol. As a black man in a predominantly white art scene, he found himself increasingly caught between a desire for fame and a fear of being exploited by that world. Like his heroes Charlie Parker and Jimi Hendrix, Basquiat burned bright but died young of a drug overdose."
115919,"Born Washington County, New York  For most of Anna Moses’s life, working the family farm in Eagle Bridge, New York, had been the central activity of her existence. By the 1930s she had retired from her duties and took up painting. Moses created pictures depicting idyllic scenes of her rural past, and the flat quality of her artworks embodied a charm capable of winning over sophisticated viewers. By 1940, the art world was coming to know the artist known as Grandma Moses, and she would become one of America’s best-loved painters.               Kristin Helberg, also a self-taught American folk artist, painted this portrait as a personal tribute to Moses. She based it loosely on a photograph showing the artist at work at her decorated tip-up table. Helberg also made the vinegar-grained frame."
115994,"Born in Goffstown, New Hampshire   In many ways Samuel Blodget symbolized the new, protean American: at different times he was a merchant, economist, entrepreneur, and amateur architect. Blodget served in the New Hampshire militia during the American Revolution and then became a merchant in Boston. In 1789 he relocated to Philadelphia and founded the Insurance Company of North America. Later, moving to the nation’s new capital in Washington, he successfully lobbied for the position of superintendent of buildings, despite George Washington’s reservations. He also founded the city’s first bank. Blodget’s only successful architectural design was the Bank of the United States (1795) in Philadelphia, which still stands. He wrote Economica: A Statistical Manual for the United States, considered the first American book on economics. In 1802 he was placed in debtor’s prison, and died insolvent in a Baltimore hospital. John Trumbull painted Blodget, posed in an elegant morning gown, when both men were in London."
116374,"Adrienne Rich was part of the great generation of post–World War II American poets and its most important woman. Her poetic beginnings were extraordinarily precocious but conventional enough in terms of style, as she positioned herself in the lineage of modernist Anglo-American poets. But a conventional poetic career, as well as a conventional career as a middle-class woman in 1950s America, increasingly did not answer for Rich. Recognizing her lesbianism, she realized that her thoughts and feelings as a woman (and poet) did not mesh with the external world. As the gap between inner and outer grew larger, Rich turned inward (she described herself at one point as ""paralyzed"") to reemerge as the poetic voice of American feminism. "
116375,"Born James Willie Brown in Bogalusa, Louisiana, Yusef Komunyakaa took the ancestral name of his slave relatives in Trinidad. After serving in Vietnam, Komunyakaa went to college and started writing poetry that sought to recapitulate African American folkways and history using a modern idiom, inflected by jazz and other musical traditions. Komunyakaa has resisted being pigeonholed as a ""jazz"" poet or a ""war"" poet. In a recent interview he talked about how literature ""is woven from masks. It involves a conjuring and acceptance of mystery. It’s almost like dealing with a series of overlays."" Yet paradoxically, truth is revealed in the making of those overlays. A poem called ""Blackbirding on the Hudson"" (about the kidnapping and enslavement of black children) concludes: ""I know the mockingbird stole cries out of the air / passed them down through the egg, & is now our only reliable witness."" Except for the poet himself, of course."
116482,"Born Keyser, West Virginia  The author of numerous books, including Life Upon These Shores (2011), Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates is one of today’s most prominent public intellectuals. He has cast a wide net of influence across generations with a variety of publications about African American history and culture, combined with frequent public appearances. Yuqi Wang’s portrait refers to 1975, when Gates “decided to become an academic.” During that year, Gates was on a fellowship at Cambridge University, where he encountered professors Wole Soyinka and Anthony Appiah, whose books are included here on the table along with W.E.B. Du Bois’s The Souls of Black Folk (1903). The sculpture next to them represents the Yoruba god Esu‑Elegbara. Gates’s analysis of the relevance of this god to black literary theory appears in his influential Signifying Monkey: A Theory of African American Literary Criticism (1988). Wang balances the composition with purple freesia, a personal reference to Cambridge, England, and Gates’s pivotal year there."
116483,"Born Cincinnati, Ohio     Adolph Ochs began his career as a newspaper boy for the Knoxville Chronicle, rising at 3:00 a.m. to fold and deliver newspapers for $1.50 per week. His disciplined work habits led to rapid promotions on several newspapers, and by 1878 he was able to purchase the Chattanooga Times. In 1896 he acquired the failing New York Times. Ochs refused to run comics and made book reviews and letters to the editor prominent features. Despite the fierce competition from the “yellow press” during the Spanish-American War, Ochs succeeded in making the Times the “newspaper of record” for the English-speaking world.  Philip de László was a society portraitist both in Europe and in America during the early decades of the twentieth century. This portrait was painted in April 1926, when the artist was in New York City."
116484,"Born Cincinnati, Ohio  In 1883 Adolph Ochs married ""Effie"" Miriam Wise, the daughter of Isaac M. Wise. Rabbi Wise—a leading exponent of Reform Judaism in America and founder of the Hebrew Union College, America’s first Jewish theological school—was concerned about his daughter marrying an ""obscure printer."" But after Ochs’s success with the Chattanooga Times, he began to look for another paper. He purchased the New York Times in 1896, and Effie became its book review editor.  In May 1930, in London, artist Philip de László created this portrait of Effie Ochs, which was later framed to form a pair with the earlier painting of her husband. Later that summer, Ochs wrote to the artist: ""Mrs. Ochs’ portrait is generally commended as a masterpiece. My daughter says that [her] descendants will cherish it as a treasured possession, and can take pride in having a woman of such culture, grace and beauty as their ancestor."""
116494,"Stampede among the Negroes in Virginia—Their Arrival at Fortress Monroe  Soon after the first fugitive slaves were granted protection as ""contraband of war"" by General Benjamin F. Butler at Union-held Fort Monroe (Virginia) in May 1861, Frank Leslie’s Illustrated Newspaper presented its readers with a double-page spread of images documenting recent events at the fort. In vignettes created by the newspaper’s ""Special Artist,"" refugees from slavery are shown making their escape from bondage, arriving at Fort Monroe, being mustered into service, and making themselves useful in a variety of ways, from preparing rations to digging trenches. At the upper right, a slaveholder is seen attempting to reclaim thirty fugitives from his estate, while at the upper left, he is shown relinquishing those bondspeople in the presence of General Butler, after refusing to take the oath of allegiance to the federal government. By the time these scenes were published, as many as 500 fugitives had found safety at Fort Monroe."
116712,"Born Chatham, New Jersey     Chef, author, local food pioneer, and sustainable agriculture advocate Alice Waters has long championed a culinary philosophy centered on the importance of preparing and serving only the freshest, in-season, organic products. Since its founding in 1971, her award-winning Chez Panisse Restaurant in Berkeley, California, has been at the forefront of a “delicious revolution” dedicated to challenging and changing the way that people think about food. The success of Waters’s farm-to-table campaign can be measured in part by the exponential increase in the number of restaurants, farmers’ markets, and mainstream grocery stores that now feature locally grown produce. Waters has also been the driving force behind the Edible Schoolyard movement, whose goal is to give students the opportunity to take an active part in all aspects of the food cycle—from cultivation to consumption.               Waters gazes into the distance in this photograph, which was taken in the Edible Schoolyard garden she established in Berkeley in 1998.    Alice Waters  nacida en 1944  Nacida en Chatham, Nueva Jersey     Chef, autora, pionera de la gastronomía local y defensora de la agricultura sustentable, Alice Waters aboga desde hace mucho por una filosofía culinaria centrada en la importancia de preparar y servir solo los productos más frescos, de temporada y orgánicos. Desde su fundación en 1971, su premiado restaurante Chez Panisse en Berkeley, California, ha estado a la vanguardia de una “deliciosa revolución” dedicada a desafiar y cambiar la opinión de la gente sobre la comida. El éxito de su campaña “de la finca a la mesa” queda evidenciado en el aumento exponencial de restaurantes, mercados agrícolas y supermercados convencionales que ahora venden productos cultivados localmente. Waters también ha sido la fuerza motriz del movimiento Edible Schoolyard, que busca ofrecer a los estudiantes la oportunidad de participar activamente en todos los aspectos del ciclo alimentario, desde el cultivo hasta el consumo.               Waters mira a la distancia en esta fotografía tomada en el huerto Edible Schoolyard que estableció en Berkeley en 1998.

116716,"Born Rochester, New York  As American poetry turned more confessional and biographical after World War II, John Ashbery resolutely refused to become personal. Influenced by experiments in stream of consciousness and European surrealism, both artistic and poetic, Ashbery writes ethereal, free-floating verse in which the ego is not simply sublimated in his writing but disappears altogether. In Ashbery’s poems the point-of-view is rarely clearly defined, and everything he describes is always changing and in flux; his poems are torrents of words and he is very fond of writing about rivers.  Emilio Sanchez’s 1946 watercolor, which combines a concern for psychological empathy with careful observation of the figure, was completed at an early moment in each of the artist’s and sitter’s respective careers. Its warmth may testify to a friendship forged in part through their mutual homosexuality, which, outside of the social mainstream of midcentury American culture, demanded coded behaviors and the support of sympathetic friends. "
116718,"Born Louisville, Kentucky  Few American sportsmen have ever possessed athletic talents comparable to those of boxer Muhammad Ali; none with such abilities have ever equaled him for charisma and bravado. Born Cassius Clay, he first made national headlines after winning a gold medal at the 1960 Olympics. Turning professional, he began his assault on the boxing ranks, attaining the heavyweight crown in 1964. But as powerful as he was in the ring, it was his words and actions outside the ring that made him a larger-than-life figure. His outrageous boasts—often in poetic verse—won him a large following. However, when he joined the Nation of Islam in 1964 and changed his name, controversy ensued. His refusal to serve in Vietnam further angered many Americans and led boxing officials to strip him of his crown. After being reinstated, Ali would reclaim the heavyweight crown, lose it, and regain it again before retiring in 1981."
116848,"Born Hanover, New Hampshire  Laura Bridgman, who lost her sight and hearing at the age of two as a result of scarlet fever, would become the first blind and deaf American child to achieve an education. Unable to function at home, in 1837 she entered the care of Dr. Samuel G. Howe, director of the Perkins Institution for the Blind in Boston. Despite the common belief that little could be done to help Bridgman, Howe taught her to read and write. Bridgman spent the rest of her life at the Perkins Institute, where she assisted with other patients and sold examples of her sewing to visitors. Through her, Americans became aware of a class of people critically in need of assistance. She became an inspiration to many, notably to Helen Keller’s mother, who hired a former pupil and teacher at the Perkins Institution to become her daughter’s instructor."
116849,"Born Amherst, Massachusetts     Helen Hunt Jackson became famous for using her pen to call attention to the plight of Native Americans. Angered by the forced removal of the Ponca tribe from its Nebraska reservation in 1879, Jackson spent the next two years completing A Century of Dishonor, a pointed exposé that chronicled the historic mistreatment of tribal peoples in America. Her later research on the Mission Indians in southern California resulted in a report to Congress outlining their desperate situation as well as the novel Ramona, a best-selling romance that Jackson hoped might “move people’s hearts” toward a more empathetic view of Native Americans."
116850,"The Harlem Renaissance of the early twentieth century was a misnomer. Harlem had always been the capital of African America, with its own cultural and social traditions. What “Renaissance” actually connoted was whites’ discovery of African America and their grudging admission to allow the most talented blacks to cross the color line and gain a measure of acceptance, if not full social and political equality. Among poets, Langston Hughes was a trailblazer, not only for black writers but also for his ability to force his way into mainstream American literature. Although white intellectuals projected their racial fantasies and preconceptions onto African Americans, seeing them as a way of revitalizing a sterile culture by injecting a dose of the “primitive,” Hughes focused on a deep commitment to African American history, treating the subject with the framework of modernist poetry. As would be the case throughout the century, a marginal or excluded group would reinvigorate the culture because their doubleness—the sense of being “in” but not completely “of” American society—worked to their advantage as artists. Paradoxically, the story of twentieth-century culture was sometimes best told through the eyes of those whom the culture most disdained: women, gays and lesbians, and African Americans."
116851,"Born Bay St. Louis, Mississippi     Richmond Barthé holds the distinction of being the only African American artist of his generation to support himself solely through the production of his art, following a trajectory characterized by hard work and unmistakable artistic talent. Growing up in the Jim Crow South, Barthé was unable to access a formal arts education until he left for the Art Institute in Chicago in 1924. While there, he focused on painting until his first attempts at sculpture, two heads modeled from clay, brought him critical attention. They were so impressive that they were chosen for Chicago’s groundbreaking 1927 “Negro in Art Week” exhibition.  Emelie Danielson Nicholson, likely working as a commercial art student in Chicago at the time, photographed Barthé with one of his first commissioned works. Barthé’s bust of Toussaint L’Ouverture represents the beginning of a prolific career sculpting figurative, subtly emotive busts and monuments ranging in subject matter from black day laborers to Broadway celebrities and politicians."
116859,"Born Toronto, Ontario  A ship steward’s daughter who toured with roving theatrical companies as a young girl to help save her family from poverty, Mary Pickford rose to stardom in the first decades of the twentieth century to become one of American cinema’s earliest stars. Admired as the epitome of feminine innocence, her childlike charm in Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1917) and Stella Maris (1918) cemented the little-girl persona that earned her the affectionate title ""America’s Sweetheart."" In 1919, in an effort to control the creation, dissemination, and promotion of her pictures, she joined director D. W. Griffith and actors Douglas Fairbanks and Charlie Chaplin in founding the independent film distribution company United Artists. Pickford’s deep involvement in the business affairs of the company, even after she retired from her professional acting career, strengthened her legacy as one of the most important figures in the early motion-picture industry."
116861,"Born Springfield, Illinois  Within fifteen years of inheriting her father’s Postum Cereal Company in 1914, Marjorie Merriweather Post transformed that business into the giant General Foods Corporation. Aided in this effort by her stockbroker-husband E. F. Hutton, who took the company public in 1922, Post demonstrated her own business savvy by moving the business into the nascent frozen food industry with her acquisition of Clarence Birdseye’s company in 1929. She subsequently served on the General Foods board of directors from 1936 until 1958. Renowned for her luxurious lifestyle and her extraordinary collection of Russian Imperial art, Post was also a generous philanthropist, giving considerable sums to the Salvation Army, the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, and other causes.   In June 1929, Post was presented at the court of Britain’s King George V and Queen Mary. She posed for this photograph wearing the gown in which she was received at Buckingham Palace."
116862,"Born Hatch Hollow, Pennsylvania  A farmer’s daughter who was born in a log cabin in western Pennsylvania, Ida Tarbell became one of America’s leading investigative journalists at the beginning of the twentieth century. Given the negative moniker of ""muckraker"" by President Theodore Roosevelt, writers such as Tarbell saw journalism as a forum for exposing abuses in American business and government. Her most celebrated series of articles centered on the collusive business tactics of Standard Oil, America’s largest oil company at the time. Published as a book in 1904, her groundbreaking exposé led the government to invoke the Sherman Antitrust Law against the company. After a series of rulings and appeals, the Supreme Court eventually dissolved Standard Oil’s holding company in 1911. In addition to authoring popular biographies of Napoleon Bonaparte and Abraham Lincoln, Tarbell wrote frequently about the challenges that women faced in American society."
116990,"Afrika Bambaataa is a founding master DJ of hip-hop and the music’s philosophical proponent around the world. A gang member raised in a Bronx housing project, Bambaataa was transformed by a trip to Africa. He returned with a vision to transmute gang violence into cultural battles based in music, dance, and the arts. He founded the Zulu Nation as a new kind of consciousness-raising gang. An influential DJ in New York City’s club scene, ""Bam"" crafted a global electrobeat with the Soul Sonic Force: he mixed disco and funk with the rhythms of DJ Kool Herc (Jamaica), Kraftwerk (Germany), and the Yellow Magic Orchestra (Japan). An intimidating figure with a tight scowl who often wears a floor-length leather coat, Bambaataa still gives this simple advice to DJs and rappers: ""you must seek knowledge."" His club hit ""Looking for the Perfect Beat"" distilled into five words the elusive musical quest of the African diaspora in its American form."
116991,"As a singer-songwriter, director, composer, and impresario of world music, David Byrne has been described as the ""thinking man’s rock star."" A shy art student, he attended the Rhode Island School of Design, where he teamed up with his friends Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth to create the thoughtful, danceable industrial rock of the Talking Heads. Collaborating with Brian Eno, Byrne led the band’s evolution from venues like CBGB into studio-driven world music—first with Remain in Light (1980)—while also composing scores for Twyla Tharp, Robert Wilson, and Jonathan Demme. As Talking Heads concerts evolved into theatrical funk spectacles, Byrne became a nerd fashion icon in his oversize white suit, as captured in Stop Making Sense　(1985). Byrne founded the world music record label Luaka Bop, and has more recently favored Latin American rhythms in his own compositions."
117014,"This portrait is typical of the ambrotypes that Mathew Brady produced for a brief period in the mid-1850s using the method patented by James A. Cutting. According to Cutting’s system, the emulsion, or image-bearing, side of the ambrotype’s glass plate was sealed to a second piece of glass using a coating of balsam of fir, a viscous resin that created a transparent bond. Once sealed in this manner, the ambrotype could be placed in a presentation case that opened from either side, with the case’s velvet pads providing the dark background against which to view the image. "
117099,"Robert Mitchum was film noir, Martin Scorsese once said, and the director Jim Jarmusch described his screen persona as ""someone smoldering on the inside but so damn cool on the outside."" Raised in a working-class family during the Great Depression, Mitchum often rode the rails, bonding with hobos before he was thirteen. Tall, broad, and pretnaturally impassive, he was a lawless soul and yet a total professional: hardworking, hard-drinking, and hard-smoking. After a sensational 1948 marijuana bust, he said little, served his time, and returned to work. He impressed every director in his fifty-year career, playing, with equal aplomb, GI Joe, a ranch owner, an admiral, or an amoral detective in the noir classic Out of the Past. He married the love of his life, lived simply but wildly, and had numerous affairs. Mitchum embodied a cool aesthetic: the projection of a relaxed indifference so deep it smacked of mystery."
117100,"Given the closeness and controversy surrounding Rutherford Hayes’s election, his inauguration may be the most significant aspect of his presidency. His victory was clouded by disputed returns in three states. A secret agreement in an appointed Electoral Commission had the Republican Hayes agree to withdraw federal troops from the South. This ended Reconstruction and African American political rights there and restored the Democratic Party’s rule in that region."
117101,"James A. Garfield (1831–1881) won the 1880 presidential election by less than 0.1 percent of the total votes cast. He had been a professor and a minister before his strong antislavery views drew him to politics. After winning a seat in Congress, he volunteered to fight in the Civil War, rising to the rank of brigadier general. Garfield was elected to the Senate in 1880. Although he had agreed not to run for president, the divided Republican Convention nominated him as a compromise candidate on the thirty-sixth ballot in one of the more frenzied moments in American political history. He served only four months before being assassinated in a Washington train station."
117212,"Born Shanghai, China  During China’s Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s, Qi Shu Fang became a star performer in the Beijing Opera. Historically, the operas were a masculine art form with female roles played by males. Qi was part of an early movement to place women in major roles, taking the lead in an opera at just eighteen years old. Renowned for her singing, acting, and martial arts ability, she was awarded the title “National Treasure of China.” In 1988, facing waning interest at home for this traditional art form, Qi immigrated to New York and formed the Qi Shu Fang Peking Opera Association.   These portraits show Qi in both ordinary dress and costumed for her signature role as the Iron Fan Princess in the classic Chinese opera The Monkey King and the Iron Fan Princess. They illustrate the remarkable transformation that Qi had to undergo—aided by elaborate makeup and costumes—in order to create her characters."

117245,"Quentin Tarantino is a filmmaker, screenwriter, and producer whose films exemplify pastiche—a key element of postmodern style—and anticipate remix culture. An outspoken and irreverent director, Tarantino grew up immersed in the film, music, and television of the 1970s, from Bruce Lee to Soul Train. Many of his films are stylish revenge narratives that combine elements of martial arts and blaxploitation films, biker films, and B movies. In an innovative move, Tarantino often writes scripts featuring cool, violent female protagonists on a quest for security, revenge, or redemption (Pam Grier in Jackie Brown [1997], Uma Thurman in Kill Bill [2003–4], the women in Death Proof [2007]). These films rarely indulge in social commentary. His style is his substance: Tarantino speaks the grammar of violence ingrained in American cinema, but by transgressing genre boundaries, he creates jarring, nonlinear narratives, as in Pulp Fiction (1994). His pulp thrillers suggest that the American collective unconscious is shot through with pop-cultural imagery awaiting interpretation."
117248,"Dizzy Gillespie was a jazz trumpeter and hip spirit who brought together the musical worlds of jazz and Latin music. Gillespie first played with the Cab Calloway and Billy Eckstine big bands, then teamed up with Charlie Parker in New York City to create bebop, transforming jazz into its modern form. Gillespie’s unique style of beret, goatee, and black-rimmed glasses was as influential as his music and much imitated by jazz musicians, fans, and rebels. A rare combination of class clown and musical mentor, Gillespie collaborated with the Cuban master drummer Chano Pozo to bring polyrhythms into jazz. In 1956 he traveled as a jazz ambassador and created goodwill in Africa and Asia by playing with local musicians on compositions like ""A Night in Tunisia"" and speaking frankly about U.S. race relations. He was married for fifty years to Lorraine Willis and was a lifelong member of the Baha’i faith. This noirish photograph once belonged to Billie Holiday."
117256,"His likableness is infectious; nobody should ever be asked not to like Paul Newman, the film critic Pauline Kael once observed. While his good looks and brilliant blue eyes might have limited the roles he was offered, Newman demonstrated his versatility and acting prowess through a legendary Hollywood career that spanned more than five decades. Often compared in the 1950s to Marlon Brando and James Dean, with whom he studied at New York’s Actors Studio, Newman became famous for playing a series of charismatic renegades in films such as The Hustler (1961), Hud (1963), Cool Hand Luke (1967), and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). He alternated roles as a good-time maverick who made defiance look easy with character portraits of desperate, hungry loners. Newman maintained his stylish stoicism in a series of later roles as aging hustlers, gangsters, and even a race car (Doc Hudson in Cars [2006]) with a voice and a certain physical grace that only deepened with age."
117270,"Hunter S. Thompson helped to found the New Journalism in the 1960s and 1970s by making himself a central figure in the often dangerous events that he covered, from outlaw motorcycle gangs to the fall of Saigon. The model for the Doonesbury cartoon character ""Duke,"" Thompson often carried a gun and made no secret of his prodigious use of alcohol and illegal narcotics to enhance his experiences and his ability to articulate them. Thompson’s drug use and his political views helped to make him a symbol of the counterculture, particularly when skewering his archenemy, President Richard Nixon. His personal style, however, drew from an earlier era of stoic poise: ""When the going gets weird,"" as he put it, ""the weird turn pro."" Later in life, describing his allegiance to a ""higher law,"" he called himself ""a road man for the lords of karma."""
117273,"I saw Patti read poetry alone. . . . I saw Patti, Lenny & Richard at Max’s Kansas City. . . . I rejoiced at her comeback performance after Fred ""Sonic"" Smith’s passing. . . . All that I love about rock & roll is embodied in Horses. When I listen, I hear the Shangri-Las in her girl-group vocals. Early Stones with Brian Jones in her swagger. . . . When she intones, ""Suddenly, Johnny gets the feeling, he’s surrounded by horses, horses, horses . . . do you know how to pony?"" it still makes my heart beat faster. Patti Smith is the original Riot Grrrl. The first woman, after Grace Slick, to not be a ""my man done left me"" victim. . . . She set the bar high.   —Katherine Miller-McCarthy, rock critic, 2005   She was skinny, quick-witted, alternated between stand-up patter and bardic intonations, and had the hypnotic emotional sway of a chanteuse . . . sexy in an androgynous way. . . . She seemed both entirely new and somehow long-anticipated.   —Luc Sante, author, 2012"
117275,"Bonnie Raitt is a singer-songwriter, guitarist, bandleader, and activist. She was a singular female icon in the 1970s: part hippie, part wanderer, part artist, part earth mother, part one-of-the-boys-in-the-band. She was the first white blueswoman to find her own voice and slide-guitar style, having apprenticed with the likes of Mississippi Fred McDowell in Boston. Raitt’s sound brings together folk ballads, classic women’s blues, country songwriting, Delta blues, and rock and roll. As a singer she hits the blue notes and bends them with heartbreaking nuance, echoing her precise slide-guitar solos. Her leather jacket and iconic mane of red hair project an old-school, no-frills authenticity: she stands still and rocks the stage with just her voice, her guitar, and the band. Raitt recorded a dozen albums over twenty years before achieving commercial success in 1989 with the hit album Nick of Time. She is still on the road half the year and contributes her time and music to many political causes."
117278,"Actress and activist Susan Sarandon started her film career as a self-declared ""hippie chick"" in Joe (1970) and The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), then charted an independent course through five decades of films. Sarandon’s mix of wide-eyed wonder and relaxed resilience marks her singular film persona, captured here by Brigitte Lacombe. Her cool sensuality runs through her roles in Pretty Baby (1978) and Atlantic City (1980)—both directed by Louis Malle—and her tough-mama turns in Bull Durham (1988) and Thelma & Louise (1991). She has often explored women’s sexuality openly on screen, from her lesbian scene in The Hunger (1983) to the class struggle of White Palace (1990). Over the past generation, Sarandon has brought together her acting and social activism, narrating various documentaries on political issues and earning an Oscar for Dead Man Walking (1995). "
117279,"One of the most gifted playwrights of his generation, Sam Shepard made his reputation exploring the dark underbelly of the American family. In plays such as Curse of the Starving Class (1976), Buried Child (1979)—which won the Pulitzer Prize for drama—and True West (1981) he probed the fractures and loneliness that pervade individuals and their family relationships. Shepard grew up in a strict military family; he dropped out of college and became involved in the off-off-Broadway theater scene. Influenced by the counterculture, his plays grapple with sin and redemption through a brutal lyricism. Shepard has also enjoyed a prolific film career as an actor and screenwriter—for Paris, Texas (1985) and Fool For Love (1984), among others—while his rugged western looks and laconic style hark back to Gary Cooper. In 1983, the year of this portrait, he was nominated for an Academy Award for his role as the pilot Chuck Yeager in The Right Stuff."
117284,"Prince is a singer, songwriter, virtuoso guitarist, and funk master. His songs meld together James Brown, Jimi Hendrix, and P-Funk and also carry the melodic imagination of the Beatles, Miles Davis, and Joni Mitchell. Prince’s aesthetic is a heady, chaotic brew that he conducts as if from the eye of a sonic storm, peeling off guitar riffs to explode into the mix. His first club hits featured young urban characters seeking sexual redemption from alienation. In the 1980s he refined a pop sensibility informed by political consciousness, alternating party songs with social protest on 1999 (1982) and Sign o’ the Times (1987). Prince is a master of stagecraft, and his concerts alternate blasts of color, dance, and sound. In the 1990s, during a contract struggle, he legally changed his name to a symbol and withdrew into the studio. Over four decades, Prince has written many hits for other artists and put the Minneapolis music scene on the map."
117292,"Bruce Springsteen is the heroic poet/everyman of rock and roll. He revitalized popular music in the 1970s through a synthesis of soul, pop, Elvis, James Brown, Bob Dylan, and Woody Guthrie. His stunning live performances still take their cues from Brown’s soul revues: he has created a concert ritual that combines elements of religion, politics, and party music.　Raised in a factory town that he found oppressive, Springsteen was inspired by Top 40 radio’s messages of hope, rebellion, freedom, sex, and pleasure. ""Rock and roll came to my house where there seemed to be no way out,"" he once said. Springsteen has a legendary work ethic and considers his art a job of social leadership: his audience is a secular congregation to whom he offers affirmation and inspiration. In an era of constant personal reinvention, Springsteen still projects a unique sense of cultural cool even in deep middle age. In this portrait he prepares for a concert backstage with a certain relaxed intensity."
117522,"Leah Chase (born 1923) is reverentially referred to as the “Queen of Creole Cuisine.” In 1945, she married jazz musician Edgar “Dooky” Chase Jr. and joined the family restaurant business in New Orleans. By the 1960s, Dooky Chase’s Restaurant was famous for Leah’s recipes and also served as a gathering spot for civil rights activists, including Martin Luther King Jr., who would join local leaders for strategy sessions over meals upstairs. Native New Orleans artist Gustave Blache made a series of small portraits documenting Leah Chase in the kitchen. Influenced by photojournalism as well as nineteenth-century artists Gustave Courbet and Edgar Degas, Blache’s intimate genre scenes capture Chase’s tireless work ethic. Remembering her working-class background, she reflected on her life, “If you work hard, you can get what you are going after.” "
117533,"Born Brno, Czech Republic (formerly Brünn, Austria-Hungary)  The composer of dynamic scores for such Hollywood classics as Captain Blood (1935) and King’s Row (1942), Eric Korngold initially won fame in Europe as a musical prodigy who completed his first major work at the age of eleven and premiered his critically acclaimed opera Die tote Stadt (1920) at twenty-three. In 1934, at the request of director Max Reinhart, Korngold traveled to Hollywood to adapt Felix Mendelssohn’s music for the film version of A Midsummer’s Night Dream (1935). Dividing his time between Europe and Hollywood, he created music for several more films and earned an Academy Award with his score for Anthony Adverse (1936). After Nazi Germany’s Anschluss in 1938 made it unsafe for him to remain in Austria, Korngold settled permanently in Hollywood, where his work for the Warner Brothers Studio soon included the Oscar-winning score for The Adventures of Robin Hood."
117535,"Born St. Louis, Missouri  In 1969, graphic designer Milton Glaser produced this poster advertising Dick Gregory’s comedy album for the Poppy label, The Light Side: The Dark Side. Gregory had begun his career as a standup comedian in the early 1960s in Chicago, part of an emerging generation of black comedians who drew on current events and racial issues for material. An appearance on The Tonight Show made him nationally famous. At the same time Gregory became an activist in the civil rights and anti-Vietnam movements and ran unsuccessfully for president in 1968. Gregory has remained an author and activist, often going on hunger strikes to show his commitment to various causes.   In an era when collecting decorative posters turned into “postermania,” Glaser produced a distinctive image with quirky stylization, bold, unexpected colors in the flesh tones, and a bifurcated, light-dark reference to the title."
117538,"   All the President’s Men  The Watergate scandal and President Richard Nixon’s subsequent resignation spawned a slew of books ranging from contemporary history to tell-all memoirs by the participants in the wide-ranging affair. In 1974 Bob Woodward turned the results of his and Carl Bernstein’s reporting for the Washington Post into All the President’s Men. The book was constructed as a detective story, the diligent reporter/heroes peeling back the layers of misdirection and obfuscation to establish the links between the White House and the original Watergate burglars. Robert Redford (born 1937) bought the rights to the book, and the film version appeared in 1976, directed by Alan J. Pakula. In their portrayal of Woodward and Bernstein, Redford (right) and Dustin Hoffman (born 1937) helped make journalism a glamorous profession for a time."
117543,"   Born Shaker Heights, Ohio  Paul Newman is one of the most iconic figures in American film and popular culture. His career was long, successful, and well-honored; he wore his fame lightly, with a grace that only complemented his charisma. His brooding good looks made him a natural for roles in productions like Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1958), for which he was nominated for an Oscar. His career never really had any down periods, as he appeared in a string of consistently excellent films. Newman finally won a Best Actor Oscar in 1986 for reprising his 1961 role as Fast Eddie Felsen in The Color of Money. The award was regarded as overdue recognition for an actor so consistently excellent that he had been taken for granted. Newman also was a successful race-car driver, operated a gourmet food brand for charity, and had a legendarily long marriage to fellow actor Joanne Woodward."
117546,"The voice of Aretha Franklin—unmistakably familiar for its depth, range, and emotional power—has shaped American soul and pop music since her first commercial success in the late 1960s. Merging her childhood interests in gospel singing—both of her parents were gospel singers and her father was a renowned preacher—with jazz, rhythm and blues, and pop music, Franklin came to be known as “Lady Soul,” belting out a string of early number one hits including “Respect” (1967) and “Since You’ve Been Gone” (1968). Considered to be one of the greatest singers of all time, Franklin is the winner of eighteen Grammy Awards and was the first woman to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1987).   In this poster, legendary graphic designer Milton Glaser conveys the creative energy of Franklin’s performances, using his characteristic kaleidoscope palette and innovative geometric forms.      La voz de Aretha Franklin —inconfundiblemente familiar por su profundidad, registro y poder emotivo— ha moldeado la música soul y pop estadounidense desde su primer éxito comercial a fines de la década de 1960. Su padre y su madre eran cantantes de góspel, y su padre un predicador célebre, por lo cual tuvo desde niña interés en el canto religioso góspel, que luego fusionó con jazz, rhythm and blues y música pop, llegando a ser conocida como la “Dama del Soul”. Desde el inicio de su carrera, lanzó una serie de éxitos que ocuparon el primer lugar en las listas, tales como “Respect” (1967) y “Since You’ve Been Gone” (1968). Considerada una de las cantantes más importantes de todos los tiempos, Franklin ha recibido dieciocho premios Grammy y fue la primera mujer incorporada al Salón de la Fama del Rock and Roll (1987).   En este cartel, el legendario diseñador gráfico Milton Glaser transmite la energía creativa de las actuaciones de Franklin utilizando la paleta caleidoscópica y las innovadoras formas geométricas que lo caracterizan"
117549,"The legacy of Walt Whitman was to ensure that American verse would be democratic in tone and subject. But this did not mean that poets ranging in style from Robert Frost to William Carlos Williams were not engaged with questions of form and difficulty. (By midcentury, there was a tendency toward a casualness of diction and subject, which masked the poet’s serious intention.) Robert Creeley was part of a generation influential in creating a more conversational, populist poetics. He identified himself with Ezra Pound and Charles Olson, but the linkage is not quite exact: he was more accessible than they were, and his work was none the weaker for that.  The title of R. B. Kitaj’s portrait of his friend comes from Creeley’s first important book, For Love (1962)."
117550,"Charles Olson closely mirrored Ezra Pound in the scope and conception of his work. He constructed a huge poetic edifice centered around a fictional everyman character (who lived in Gloucester, Massachusetts) called ""Maximus,"" through whom streamed a voice that was both vernacular and mythic. Again, like Pound, Olson was distrustful of modern life and history, viewed progress as a swindle, and thought that rationalism was an impediment to authentic self-expression. He called modern life the ""pejorocracy,"" as in ""love is not easy / but how shall you know, / New England, now / that pejorocracy is here."" The Maximus Poems (1953) sprawled across the page in a torrent of words and images, a personal poetic vision that one is stunned into admiring but that is so idiosyncratic that it is hard to comprehend, let alone encompass."
117551,"Born Villa Grove, Illinois   Twentieth-century American poet Ed Dorn broke boundaries by capturing provocative intersections between poetry and political engagement. While studying at Black Mountain College in North Carolina, he worked closely with poets Charles Olson, Robert Creeley, and Robert Duncan. Dorn’s most well known work was the five-volume epic poem Gunslinger. Stemming from a project documenting Indian reservations, the work can be understood as a reflection on the state of the American West in the 1960s. In Gunslinger, Dorn cleverly mixes the jargon of junkies, Westerners, and scientists to reflect the jumble of contemporary American speech.  R. B. Kitjai’s 1966 portrait of Dorn captures the poet’s distinct individuality. Committing to exploring the relationship between image and language, Kitaj became involved with contemporary writers, befriending many influential poets."
117626,"Born Krakow, Poland     Helena Rubinstein triumphed in a male-dominated business world, working methodically toward her goals. She first made her reputation through the specialized treatments she offered to women at her exclusive salons, but she amassed her fortune in the 1920s by selling mass-produced cosmetics internationally. Her legendary career paved the way for other entrepreneurial women. Mexican artist Roberto Montenegro here captures her dynamic personality and dramatic flair. He depicts Rubinstein wearing a specially designed necklace made by William Spratling, who created a center for Mexican jewelry in Taxco during the 1930s. Rubinstein wrote in her autobiography, “Although I no longer need the added courage that handsome jewelry once gave me (it was not easy being a hard-working woman in a man’s world many years ago), I am aware that the wearing of exotic jewelry has become . . . a mark of my identity.”"
117628,"Born Krakow, Poland  Entrepreneur Helena Rubinstein built her fortune in cosmetics, opening her first shop in Melbourne, Australia, in 1902. The quick growth of her business inspired her to open salons around the world, including London, Paris, and New York City. She decorated the salons as a mix of public and private spaces, with modern art and furnishings from her own vast art collections. Her African sculpture collection was one of the largest privately held collections, and she also commissioned more than twenty portraits of herself.   Rubinstein’s successful marketing of her products’ image and highlighting of celebrity clientele created cachet for her brand. She projected the appearance of a successful, elegant, modern, and refined hostess. A variation of this etching by Paul César Helleu was used in advertisements for her beauty salons and products. Helleu created this portrait in a typically 1920s style, with the feathered embellishment and bobbed hair."
117631,"Born Cheshire, Connecticut  One of the most popular members of the second generation of the Hudson River School of American landscape painters, artist and engraver John Frederick Kensett was much admired for his keen observations of nature, his refined compositions, and his sensitive rendering of light. Elected to full membership in the prestigious National Academy in 1849, he later helped to found New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art. During the Civil War, Kensett chaired the Art Committee of the New York Metropolitan Fair, which raised funds that enabled the United States Sanitary Commission to provide much-needed relief for sick and wounded soldiers."
117632,"Born Norfolk, England  An influential British politician, Charles Townshend served from 1766 to 1767 as chancellor of the exchequer, in which capacity he oversaw the government’s finances. Seeking to offset a reduction in the British land tax, which he supported, Townshend championed a series of levies on imported goods aimed at the American colonies. Adopted in 1767, the Townshend Acts were met with hostility: colonists resisted taxation by a Parliament in which they had no representation. The Boston Massacre (1770), fueled by popular anger against the British government, helped bring about the partial repeal of the acts. But a duty on tea remained, leading to the Boston Tea Party of 1773, which helped set in motion the broad resistance that would bring about the American Revolution. Townsend is pictured here in an engraving by the Irish artist John Dixon, created after a painted portrait by Joshua Reynolds."
117664,"Born in England, Denise Levertov became a major American poet, noted for her impassioned commitment to poetry that served political and humanitarian causes. Her background was multinational and multiethnic, and she was ever-conscious of her sense of having a universal identity on which to base her appeals against injustice. At first, her writing showed the influence of T. S. Eliot, and she wrote in the tradition of midcentury English modernism, with attention to formal structure. In America (she immigrated in 1947), her poetry got more fluid when she became part of the avant-garde Black Mountain School. She published consistently but came into her own in the 1960s and 1970s, when she became a poetic voice for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. "
117674,"Born Yorkshire, England  Richard Bache married Benjamin Franklin’s only daughter, Sarah, in 1767, and the couple lived in Franklin’s home. Although he was in debt at the time, which worried Franklin, Bache proved his mettle to his father-in-law when he became director of Robert Morris’s Bank of North America. Bache was well known during the Revolutionary War, serving as postmaster general from 1776 to 1782. He also served on the Pennsylvania Board of War and helped lead the ""conservative"" movement, which overturned the ""radical"" Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776.  After Franklin’s death, Sarah and Richard Bache traveled to England, where they met John Hoppner—one of the most respected portraitists at the time—through mutual friends. Hoppner, whose work was copied by American artists, including Rembrandt Peale and Thomas Sully, painted this portrait and a pendant of Sarah, which is now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art."
117693,"For the past decade, the Williams sisters have been dominant figures in professional tennis. Serena Williams has been ranked number one in singles on six separate occasions, the first time in July 2002. As of spring 2013, she has won thirty-one Grand Slam titles, including thirteen doubles championships with her sister Venus, and four Olympic gold medals. Venus Williams has been ranked number one on three separate occasions, the first in February 2002. She has won twenty-two Grand Slam titles and has won forty-four career singles titles, including five Wimbledon titles and an Olympic gold medal.  Annie Leibovitz’s double portrait of the sisters in 1998 was taken just before each broke through as a Grand Slam singles champion. The following year Serena would win her first U.S. Open, and two years later Venus would take her first win at Wimbledon in women’s singles. "
117704,"Born Boston, Massachusetts  Samuel Adams played a critical role in Revolutionary politics, inciting opposition among his fellow Bostonians to the Sugar Act (1764), the Stamp Act (1765), and the Townshend Acts (1767). He also played a leading role in the legendary Boston Tea Party (1773). With his cousin John Adams and James Bowdoin, Adams co-authored the Massachusetts Constitution (1780), which appears here; it became a model for the American Constitution. In the background is Boston’s Faneuil Hall, the site of many stirring speeches by Adams. A member of the Continental Congress (1774–81), Adams signed the Declaration of Independence. He served as governor of Massachusetts from 1794 to 1797, the year in which George Graham produced this celebratory print, based on a 1795 painting by John Johnston. The painting was lost to fire only a few years later, further enhancing the importance of this lifetime depiction of Adams."
117708,"Americans responded to the death of George Washington on December 14, 1799, with an outpouring of oratorical and pictorial tributes. One of the more elaborate mourning prints was this engraving by John James Barralet, called The Apotheosis of Washington in the press and viewed by subscribers around December 19. Drawing on classical, Christian, military, and federal symbolism, Barralet depicted Washington rising from his tomb, assisted by Father Time and Immortality. Mourning at his feet, near the military symbols of helmet, sword, and armor, are an eagle, an allegorical figure of America with her liberty cap, and a sorrowful Native American. The figures of Faith, Hope, and Charity grieve in the background.  Barralet’s image was enormously popular, frequently copied on American canvases, needlework patterns, English transfer-printed creamware, and Chinese reverse painting on glass. The plate was reengraved several times because of high demand; Benjamin Tanner published this last state as the Commemoration of Washington in 1816.     Los estadounidenses reaccionaron a la muerte de George Washington el 14 de diciembre de 1799 con una efusión de homenajes verbales y pictóricos. Una de las imágenes de duelo más elaboradas fue este grabado de John James Barralet, titulado en la prensa La apoteosis de Washington y visto por los lectores hacia el 19 de diciembre. Recurriendo a simbolismos clásicos, cristianos, militares y federales, Barralet representó a Washington levantándose de su tumba, asistido por el Padre Tiempo y la Inmortalidad. A sus pies, cerca de los símbolos militares (casco, espada y armadura), están un águila (figura alegórica de América con su gorro frigio) y un afligido indígena americano. Las figuras de la Fe, la Esperanza y la Caridad se lamentan en segundo plano.  La imagen de Barralet gozó de una popularidad enorme y fue copiada con frecuencia en lienzos, bordados, cerámica inglesa decorada por calco y pinturas en vidrio según la técnica china. La plancha se volvió a grabar varias veces debido a la alta demanda; Benjamin Tanner imprimió el grabado en este último estado con el nombre de Conmemoración de Washington en 1816."
117816,"Born Rocky River, Ohio     Under George Steinbrenner’s thirty-seven-year tenure as owner of the New York Yankees, the team flourished, winning seven world championships and eleven pennants. Despite that success, Steinbrenner was a controversial figure because his brash and sometimes illegal behavior consistently put him in the headlines, even over the achievements of his team and players. Heir to a Great Lakes shipping company, Steinbrenner acquired the Yankees in 1973 and quickly demonstrated an inability to distance himself from the team’s daily business, earning himself the nickname “The Boss.” The Yankees underwent nineteen managerial changes during his ownership, just one illustration of his hands-on style.              David Levine’s caricature humorously points out both Steinbrenner’s inability to remain unobtrusive as well as his shady money dealings, with a bag of money weighing down the bat he is holding."
117945,"Born Tucson, Arizona     In 1965, when New York City’s Madison Avenue was the epicenter of American advertising, David N. Martin and business partner George Woltz broke the “Mad Men” mold by founding their advertising venture in Richmond, Virginia. Originally known as Martin and Woltz (it was renamed the Martin Agency in 1975), the business developed rapidly into one of the nation’s largest advertising concerns. Early successes included a marketing campaign for Colonial Williamsburg illustrated by Norman Rockwell. But it was the company’s 1969 promotion of Virginia tourism with the memorable tagline “Virginia is for Lovers” that propelled the firm into the advertising industry’s upper ranks.

118370,"Audre Lorde’s poetry is animated by her deep anger against the oppression of women. Poetry was a way for her, as a young woman coming out as a lesbian, to speak with her own voice. It gave her the power to address society, advocating cultural and political change. Poems are not political slogans, of course, and it is only by rhetorical balance that poetry, however incendiary the subject, can occur. As Lorde put it in her white-hot poem ""Power,"" about a police killing: ""unless I learn to use the difference between poetry and rhetoric / my power too will run corrupt as poisonous mold."" Like many politically engaged women writers, Lorde used her poetry as a way of writing her way out from under a language corrupted by the abuses of history, toward a new poetics—and a new politics."
118393,"Through much of 1864, with the Civil War in an apparent stalemate, Abraham Lincoln did not expect to win reelection. In September, however, came news of General Sherman’s conquest of Atlanta and then General Sheridan’s victories in the Shenandoah Valley. Lincoln, appearing as a victorious commander-in-chief, won easily in November. On March 4, 1865, the president delivered his second inaugural address, which looked toward peace ""with malice toward none."" Lincoln was shot on April 14 and died the next day."
118394,"When antidraft rioters took to the streets of New York on July 12, 1863, William Jones was among the first of the city’s free black residents to fall victim to the mob’s murderous rampage.  Sparked by anger over a draft lottery instituted as part of the federal Conscription Act and fueled by incendiary, anti-emancipation rhetoric, hostile mobs first attacked and torched the office where the lottery had taken place. The rioters then turned their fury on New York’s free black population. After looting and burning the Colored Orphan Asylum, where 233 children barely escaped with their lives, roving mobs proceeded to attack African Americans in their homes and on the street. By the time police and military units quelled the rioting, at least twelve persons of color had been killed, including William Jones, who lost his life when he was beaten and hanged by rioters, who then set fire to his body."
118432,"Born Savannah, Georgia     During her relatively short life (she was chronically ill with lupus), Flannery O’Connor created a distinctive voice as a writer of novels and short fiction; she is especially important for the quality of personal and religious redemption that animates her writing, a product of her Catholicism.  After college in Georgia she attended the famous writing program at the University of Iowa (1945–47), drawing on her thesis for her first published short story and novel, Wise Blood (1952). Her first collection of stories was A Good Man Is Hard to Find (1955); her second, Everything That Rises Must Converge, was published posthumously in 1965. Despite her spare output, O’Connor is considered a master at the craft of American writing.  Created by Atlanta-based photographer Joseph Reshower, this portrait appeared on the book jacket for O’Connor’s The Complete Stories. Published after the author’s death, the anthology received the National Book Award in 1972."
118516,"Born Burlington, Vermont     Grace Goodhue graduated from the University of Vermont in 1902, then trained at the Clarke Institute for the Deaf in Northampton, Massachusetts. There she met Calvin Coolidge, whom she married in 1905; they had two sons. As first lady, her warmth and charm balanced her husband’s stern public personality. Although President Coolidge, reacting to the previous administration’s scandals, shielded his family from the press, the first lady found channels to exert her influence. She once gave a five-minute speech in sign language at a luncheon for newspaperwomen, reinforcing her advocacy for the education of the deaf. She also undertook a remodeling of the White House."
118536,"The first black regiment to be organized in a northern state, the 54th Massachusetts Colored Regiment included recruits from twenty-five states as well as Canada. In late May 1863, under the leadership of its white commander, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw, the 54th was ordered to the South Carolina coast in preparation for action aimed at taking the city of Charleston. Called upon to lead the Union assault on Fort Wagner, the heavily fortified Confederate bastion that guarded Charleston’s main shipping channel, the 54th spearheaded the bold attack that began at dusk on July 18, 1863. Despite withering Confederate fire that decimated their ranks and killed Colonel Shaw, the men of the 54th bravely mounted two assaults before they were driven back by the fort’s defenders. Although a defeat for Union forces, the admirable performance of the 54th laid to rest any lingering doubts about the fitness for battle of African American soldiers. "
118626,"The most controversial comedian of his day, Lenny Bruce used humor as a form of confrontation, shocking audiences with his caustic social commentary. He was known as the ""hipster comic"" and the ""sickest of the sick,"" frequently hounded by the police for obscene language and for his satires of religion and the justice system. Bruce studied acting under the GI Bill, and he got his start performing in burlesque clubs in New York City, developing a loyal following among younger audiences. His free-form, often rambling act set the standard for a new outlaw style of comedy. Yet his irreverence toward authority had real-life consequences. At times nightclubs refused to book him, and in 1963 he was banned from entering Great Britain. Bruce died in 1966 at the age of forty from a heroin overdose. Fellow comedian Dick Gregory once said of his influence: ""he’s to show business what Einstein was to science."""
118648,"As a journalist, novelist, essayist, and screenwriter, Joan Didion has been one of the key chroniclers of American life since 1965. A co-creator of New Journalism with Norman Mailer and Tom Wolfe, she became an instant role model for California women in the 1960s. Petite and yet powerfully demure, Didion displays a self-possession that belies her size: ""My only advantage as a reporter is that I am so physically small, so temperamentally unobtrusive, that people tend to forget my presence runs counter to their best interests."" Her prose is sparse and precise, as if ""sculpted from dry ice,"" the author Michael Cunningham once said, and her style is indebted to the California noir tradition of Raymond Chandler. Her essay collections capture the essence of decades: Slouching towards Bethlehem (1968), The White Album (1979), Miami (1987), and Political Fictions (2001)."
118696,"Born New York City  Alex Katz’s stylistic hallmarks—the influence of billboard advertising and the cropping of subjects to dramatic effect in particular—could not have been better suited for his portrait of the larger-than-life personality of Bella Abzug. An irascible lawyer and congresswoman, Abzug wore big hats and spoke loudly for the causes she believed in, which encompassed everything from feminism to civil rights. Asked to portray a politician of his liking, Katz picked Abzug as his first choice, and he made this portrait after observing the activist at her office. In a career that spanned more than forty years, Abzug fearlessly threw herself into many of the country’s most difficult issues, from Vietnam and McCarthyism to equal rights for gays and lesbians. With its flat planes of color and the banner-like lettering of Abzug’s first name, Katz’s image captures the political nature of Abzug’s persona. "
118778,"Born Harlem, New York City     The son of Jamaican immigrants, retired four-star general Colin L. Powell decided on a military career while at City College of New York. He served in Vietnam, earning a Purple Heart and Bronze Star. A White House Fellowship brought him to the attention of Caspar Weinberger, who made Powell his aide upon becoming President Reagan’s secretary of defense. While there, Powell helped to coordinate the invasion of Granada and bombing of Libya in 1986. Powell became national security advisor in 1987 and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1991 and helped plan Operation Desert Storm. There, he enunciated what became known as the “Powell doctrine” of using “decisive force” to maximize success and minimize casualties, a reformulation of strategy resulting from the army’s unhappiness with the way in which the United States fought the Vietnam War. In 2001 President George W. Bush appointed Powell to be the first African American secretary of state.                  After visiting a number of sites relevant to Powell’s career, artist Ronald Sherr placed him in front of Theodore Roosevelt Hall at National War College at Fort McNair in Washington."
118784,"Born Mount Airy, North Carolina     As the star of The Andy Griffith Show (1960–68) and Matlock (1986–95), Andy Griffith established himself as one of network television’s most beloved personalities. He first gained notice on the big screen starring in Elia Kazan’s A Face in the Crowd (1957) and then in No Time for Sergeants (1958), but it was his role as the sheriff of the mythical North Carolina town of Mayberry that won him national popularity. When The Andy Griffith Show debuted on CBS in the fall of 1960, it quickly became Monday night’s most popular television program. Before the show’s second season, Griffith embarked by train from Hollywood on a two-week cross-country tour to “meet people” and promote the show. Photographer Art Shay captured this image of Griffith in his Sheriff Andy Taylor uniform as the actor leaned out of the train during a whistle stop in Chicago.   "
118785,"Born St. Joseph, Missouri  Artist Elizabeth Peyton, long drawn to painting controversial rock stars, uses soft grays and a generous brushstroke to highlight rapper Eminem’s fine features and strong tattoos. He assesses the viewer with a look that is at once steely-eyed and alluring. Eminem (born Marshall Mathers) has made a Grammy-winning career out of blurring boundaries—between white and black America, obscenity and vulnerability, despair and fantasy. Bullied as a child growing up in Detroit, Eminem thrived in rap battle competitions. In 1997 his first album, The Slim Shady LP, caught the attention of legendary rapper and impresario Dr. Dre. His second, The Marshall Mathers LP, went diamond, selling more than ten million copies despite its controversial lyrics. His 2002 autobiographical movie, 8 Mile, led to an Academy Award for the song “Lose Yourself.” Plagued by convictions for carrying concealed weapons, drug addictions, and a troubled family life, Eminem remains one of the most influential rappers of all time.    Em (Blue)  Eminem  nacido en 1972  Nacido en St. Joseph, Misuri     La artista Elizabeth Peyton, quien ha demostrado su gusto por pintar estrellas de rock controversiales, utiliza aquí grises suaves y una pincelada generosa para resaltar los finos rasgos del rapero Eminem y sus impactantes tatuajes. El modelo sondea al público con ojos fríos y a la vez seductores. Eminem (nacido Marshall Mathers), ganador de numerosos premios Grammy, ha hecho una carrera a base de traspasar fronteras: fronteras entre la América blanca y la negra, entre la obscenidad y la vulnerabilidad, entre la desilusión y la fantasía. Víctima de acoso escolar durante su niñez en Detroit, Eminem comenzó a destacarse en las competencias de improvisación de rap. En 1997 su primer disco, The Slim Shady LP, llamó la atención del legendario rapero y empresario Dr. Dre. Su segundo disco, The Marshall Mathers LP, alcanzó la categoría de disco de diamante al vender más de diez millones de copias a pesar de sus controversiales letras. En 2002 protagonizó la película autobiográfica 8 Mile, que ganó un Oscar por la canción “Lose Yourself”. Su vigencia ha quedado demostrada en su exitosa gira “Monster” junto a Rihanna y en la distinción de ser, en 2014, el primer rapero que se ha presentado como atracción principal en el estadio Wembley de Londres.

118787,"Born National City, California     California native John Baldessari is a leading conceptual artist and dedicated educator, teaching art for more than thirty years in all levels of the California school system. After famously cremating his early paintings in the 1970s, Baldessari expanded his work from painting to other mediums, most notably photographs and film. Using found images from old Hollywood movies or filming language games and chance experiments (such as throwing a ball), he emphasizes the randomness of the creative process.   This large work by Alphonse van Woerkom uses detailed crosshatching to wonderful effect, particularly for the artist’s skin and hair. He also captures the essence of Baldessari’s stature (six foot, seven inches) by allowing the forms to swell to the edges of the paper. In 2013, the California Institute of the Arts opened the John Baldessari Art Studio Building, acknowledging the artist’s generosity and his love of teaching.    John Baldessari  nacido en 1931  Nacido en National City, California     El californiano John Baldessari es un prominente artista conceptual y un educador comprometido que ha enseñado arte durante más de treinta años en todos los niveles del sistema educativo de California. Luego de su famoso gesto de cremar sus pinturas tempranas en la década de los setenta, Baldessari extendió su quehacer a otros medios fuera de la pintura, sobre todo la fotografía y el cine. Ya sea que se valga de imágenes encontradas en viejas películas de Hollywood o que filme juegos de lenguaje y experimentos fortuitos (como lanzar una pelota), en todo enfatiza el carácter aleatorio del proceso creativo.  En esta obra de gran formato, Alphonse van Woerkom obtiene excelentes efectos a base de tramas de rayas cruzadas, sobre todo en la piel y el pelo del artista. También capta la esencia de la estatura de Baldessari (seis pies con siete pulgadas) al permitir que las formas se extiendan hacia los bordes del papel. En 2013, el California Institute of the Arts inauguró el edificio John Baldessari Art Studio, en reconocimiento de la generosidad del artista y su amor por la enseñanza.

Her music is generally R&B, but also includes pop, electropop, funk, hip-hop, and soul. The Recording Industry of America has recognized her as the Top Certified Artist of the 2000s. As of 2013, Beyoncé was the most-nominated woman in Grammy Award history, winning seventeen awards. She has also won twelve MTV Video Music Awards, a Billboard Millennium Award, and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.  An electrifying performer, she is known for highly choreographed dance routines that are as eye-popping as her costumes.

118793,"Born Palo Alto, California  Prize-winning writer Julie Otsuka posed for Philip Grausman when she was an undergraduate at Yale University and Grausman was on the faculty. Memories of growing up in California and hearing stories of her grandfather’s arrest after Pearl Harbor and the subsequent internment of her grandmother, uncle, and mother led Otsuka to write novels charting the experience of Japanese Americans. She has commented on the link between the “visual” characters that populate her novels and her training as an artist. Grausman’s graceful lines and delicate modeling capture a contemplative view of Otsuka, who describes her writing as “deeply internal.”"
118842,"Born Portland, Oregon  Jazz bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding electrified the Grammy Awards in 2011 by winning honors as Best New Artist. She was inspired as a child by Yo-Yo Ma and played several different stringed instruments before settling on the bass when she was in high school. She released her first album, Junjo, in 2006. Her fourth release, Radio Music Society, received high critical marks at its release in March 2012. Spalding’s musical roots reflect her cultural diversity—her father is African American; her mother Welsh, Native American, and Hispanic—and she sings in English, Spanish, and Portuguese.  Sandrine Lee’s photograph shows the musician in an old railroad station in Connecticut. Spalding has emphasized in interviews that music does not only happen in recording studios and concert halls, but also in more intimate, everyday spaces, as captured here."
118901,"Born Thomas Greene Wiggins, the blind son of two slaves owned by Colonel James Bethune, “Blind Tom” became famous as a musical savant at a young age. Bethune presented Wiggins throughout Georgia before hiring him out to tour across the country. Wiggins played for President James Buchanan in 1860; the Bethunes also offered his talents to the Confederacy during the Civil War. After emancipation, Bethune convinced Wiggins’s parents to appoint him Tom’s legal guardian. Wiggins earned a fortune for his guardians and remained under the care of Bethune family members for the rest of his life.  He was known not only as a skilled performer—he could sing in multiple languages and play a piece of music after hearing it once—but also as a composer of more than one hundred piano and vocal compositions. This portrait appears on the cover of his composition entitled “The Oliver Gallop,” named after Perry Oliver, one of his promoters.     Thomas Greene Wiggins, el hijo ciego de dos esclavos propiedad del coronel James Bethune, apodado “El Ciego Tom”, se volvió famoso como savant musical desde pequeño.

118924,"Born Bay City, Michigan  Before she became a cultural icon, Madonna studied with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. But by the early 1980s, she had embraced pop choreography, and the rise of MTV would make her a superstar.  The “Material Girl” used the razzle-dazzle of music videos to transform pop concerts into dance spectacles. Because videos used lip-synching, performers could concentrate on showmanship, and Madonna’s pyrotechnical extravaganzas were unsurpassed. She popularized the use of the headset microphone to allow greater movement and used choreography to continually push conventional boundaries. She was also the first performer to use her concert tours as reenactments of her music videos. In 2003 MTV named her “The Greatest Music Video Star Ever” for her innovative contributions to that art form.  The chart-topping single “Vogue” was featured in the 1990 film Dick Tracy. "
118939,"Born Indiana, Pennsylvania     Renowned for her luminous soprano and dynamic stage presence, Renée Fleming is among the world’s most popular opera and concert artists. After winning the prestigious Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions (1988), Fleming appeared with several major opera companies at home and abroad before making her critically acclaimed Metropolitan Opera debut in 1991 as the Countess in Mozart’s The Marriage of Figaro. Rather than confining herself to a small range of roles, she has built a diverse repertoire of more than fifty operas over the course of her career. Known as “the people’s diva,” Fleming is a far cry from the prima donnas of old. Although this glamorous image shows her on stage basking in the spotlight, the four-time Grammy winner has frequently ventured beyond the confines of the opera house. She released the indie-rock album Dark Hope (2010), and in 2014 became the first operatic performer to sing the national anthem at the Super Bowl.    Renée Fleming  nacida en 1959  Nacida en Indiana, Pensilvania     Célebre por su luminosa voz de soprano y dinámica presencia escénica, Renée Fleming es una de las cantantes de ópera y concierto más populares. A raíz de ganar las prestigiosas audiciones del Metropolitan Opera National Council (1988), comenzó a presentarse con importantes compañías de ópera en Estados Unidos y el exterior, hasta que en 1991 hizo su aclamado debut con la Metropolitan Opera en el papel de la Condesa en Las bodas de Fígaro, de Mozart. En vez de limitarse a pocos roles, ha desarrollado un amplio repertorio de más de cincuenta óperas a lo largo de su carrera. Conocida como “la diva de la gente”, Fleming dista de ser una prima donna al estilo de antaño. Si bien esta glamorosa foto la muestra en el escenario, feliz a la luz de los reflectores, esta ganadora de cuatro premios Grammy a menudo incursiona fuera de la sala de ópera.

118955,"Born San Diego, California  Shaun White, aka “The Flying Tomato” (for his long red hair), is a professional “X Games” athlete, specializing in both skate- and snowboarding. Raised in Vermont and Southern California, White has won two Olympic gold medals in the snowboard halfpipe in successive winter games (2006, 2010). He has also been a multiple medalist in other national and international boarding competitions. Having overcome a heart defect as an infant, White started skateboarding at an early age and was discovered by the modern pioneer of the genre, Tony Hawk. Hawk mentored White’s sports and business careers, helping him obtain his first endorsement as well as professional contracts in the burgeoning skate and ski industries. White is clearly Hawk’s successor as the face of alternative games, not only because of his skill on the boards but also for his infectious, effervescent personality."
118956,"Following in a long line of distinguished actors known for playing villains, Benicio Del Toro has now crafted a persona as an ethical rebel loner in the tradition of film noir. For shaping his acting style, Del Toro credits Robert Mitchum and Jack Nicholson as important influences. After a string of small parts, his breakout performance as a mumbling petty criminal in The Usual Suspects (1995) propelled him to Hollywood stardom. Yet it was his portrayal of a small-town cop seeking peace amid the U,S,–Mexican drug wars in Traffic (2000) that won him an Academy Award for best supporting actor. Del Toro’s quiet intensity and sense of purpose in that role served as an ethical counterweight to the film’s rampant violence and corruption. Acclaimed for his roles in independent films such as 21 Grams (2003) and Sin City (2005), Del Toro won the best actor award at Cannes for his portrayal of Che Guevara in the four-hour epic biopic Che (2008)."
118957,"Born Decatur, Georgia  One of the founders of the post-punk rock band R.E.M., Michael Stipe was born into an army family that moved frequently. He returned to his birth state of Georgia in 1978 to attend the university in Athens but dropped out after he and guitarist Peter Buck formed a band. R.E.M. came together in 1980; although the name describes a deep sleep state that mirrors the band’s dreamlike compositions, Stipe claims he chose it randomly from a dictionary. The band’s debut album, Murmur, came out in 1983 and was named Rolling Stone’s album of the year. Thereafter R.E.M. released albums regularly—including their best-selling Out of Time (1991) and Automatic for the People (1992)—and toured until the band’s dissolution in 2011. A charismatic performer, Stipe’s vocal style became sharper and clearer as the band evolved from its stream-of-consciousness roots to a more direct approach. "
118962,"   Born Montgomery, Alabama    Nat ""King"" Cole first made his name in pop music primarily as a pianist with the King Cole jazz trio that he formed in 1939, and some experts think that his most significant contribution to music was a keyboard technique that influenced a number of other noted musicians. But by 1950, the public at large was coming to know Cole as the crooner whose relaxed manner went hand-in-glove with his caressing voice. As hits such as ""Mona Lisa"" and ""Unforgettable"" followed one another, he became one of America’s favorite entertainers, and in the fall of 1956 he became the first African American to host a network television show. Cole was sometimes faulted for not being more outspoken in the civil rights cause, but his broad popular appeal was in itself a contribution to the struggle against racism. "
118974,"Born St. Louis, Missouri  One of America’s most important writers and poets, Maya Angelou (born Marguerite Ann Johnson) wrote a series of seven autobiographical novels that are an indelible record of resistance and achievement by African Americans, particularly African American women. Angelou had a difficult and endangered childhood, shuttling back and forth between relatives in the North and South. She suffered from economic hardship and sexual abuse, which she documented in her first book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), and in subsequent volumes. Her subject was always her own life, and her autobiographies are not necessarily strictly factual or literally “true,” but rather a retelling of emotional truths. A politically engaged writer, Angelou was also a poet; she read her poem “On the Pulse of the Morning” at President Bill Clinton’s 1993 inauguration."
118993,"Born St. Louis Park, Minnesota     A caricaturist who used exaggeration and wit to brilliant effect, David Levine perhaps met his match in depicting the screenwriting/directing team of Joel and Ethan Coen, brothers who have created a body of work that is idiosyncratic, satiric, and influenced by the film noir tradition. With unnaturally large heads and connected by a film strip, the Academy Award–winning pair, although naked, look out at us with a fierce seriousness, a combination suggesting the bizarre sense of humor found in their films. Born to parents who were professors, they began making movies as children in the mid-1960s.  The Coen brothers’ early comedies about murder, Fargo (1996), and a pot-smoking philosopher, The Big Lebowski (1998)—and later psychological portraits, such as No Country for Old Men (2007)—are critically acclaimed for writing and direction, as well as superb performances by such actors as Jeff Bridges and Frances McDormand. Their most recent film, Inside Llewyn Davis (2013), won the Cannes grand prize.    Joel Coen  nacido en 1954  Ethan Coen  nacido 1957  Nacidos en St. Louis Park, Minnesota     Como caricaturista, David Levine utilizaba la exageración y el ingenio con brillantes resultados, y en esto quizás encontró a sus almas gemelas cuando le tocó dibujar a los hermanos Joel y Ethan Cohen, el famoso binomio guionista/director que ha creado un cuerpo de obras idiosincráticas, satíricas e influenciadas por la tradición del film noir. Con cabezas enormes y unidos por una cinta de película, este dúo ganador de varios Oscars nos mira con gran seriedad a pesar de estar completamente desnudos, un contraste que sugiere el extraño humor que encontramos en sus películas.

118994,"Born Minneapolis, Minnesota     A prolific, fastidious observer of the everyday and a conjurer of eccentrics, Anne Tyler has written nearly twenty novels over the span of five decades, her most well-known arguably being The Accidental Tourist (1985). In a 1976 review in The New Yorker, John Updike—an author similarly dedicated to the travails of the everyman—proclaimed her writing “wickedly good.” In this illustration accompanying a review of Tyler’s The Amateur Marriage (2004), David Levine shows the writer in her typical topknot, using a magnifying glass to analyze bride and groom figurines atop a wedding cake. The magnifying glass is an apt metaphor for Tyler’s writing style: rich with minute details that allow us to inhabit the small, ordinary moments of her characters. Also alluding to her penchant for the mild-mannered, Levine shows Tyler smiling at the viewer, despite her quasi-scientific task at hand. The Pulitzer Prize–winning writer recently completed what she says is her final novel, A Spool of Blue Thread (2015).    Anne Tyler  nacida en 1941  Nacida en Mineápolis, Minnesota     Prolífica y minuciosa observadora de lo cotidiano, fabuladora de lo excéntrico, Anne Tyler ha escrito una veintena de novelas a lo largo de cinco décadas, siendo quizás la más famosa The Accidental Tourist (1985). En una reseña de 1976 en The New Yorker, John Updike, autor también dedicado a la gesta del hombre común, proclamó que Tyler tenía una prosa “endiabladamente buena”. En esta ilustración que acompañó una reseña de The Amateur Marriage (2004), David Levine nos muestra a la autora con su típico moño, lupa en mano para analizar las figurillas del novio y la novia sobre un pastel de bodas. La lupa es una metáfora muy a tono con el estilo literario de Tyler, repleto de detalles que nos permiten habitar los pequeños instantes del día a día de sus personajes. Levine también alude a su preferencia por los personajes amables y la muestra sonriendo al espectador, a pesar del carácter cuasi científico de la tarea que la ocupa. Tyler, ganadora del premio Pulitzer, ha terminado recientemente la que dice será su última novela, A Spool of Blue Thread (2015).     David Levine (1926–2009)  Tinta sobre grafito en papel, 2004"
118997,"Born London, England     A signal voice of the Indian American immigrant experience, Jhumpa Lahiri won the Pulitzer Prize with her debut short-story collection, The Interpreter of Maladies (1999), which catapulted her into the public eye. Born in London to Bengali parents, Lahiri moved to Rhode Island at age two. During her childhood, she was acutely aware of her unique background and sought solace in reading. It was as an adult, while obtaining a doctorate in literature, that she realized the expressive outlet that writing offered and changed course to pursue a literary career.  David Levine’s caricature of Lahiri, accompanying a book review of Unaccustomed Earth (2008), emphasizes her cerebral personality. Her intellect is the star here. At the same time, by showing her in traditional dress, seated on the floor with a computer, Levine suggests the dual Western/Eastern identity that Lahiri has explored in written form. Her most recent novel, The Lowlands (2013), was a finalist for the National Book Award.    Jhumpa Lahiri  nacida en 1967  Nacida en Londres, Inglaterra     Voz señera de la experiencia del inmigrante indo-americano, Jhumpa Lahiri ganó el premio Pulitzer con su primera colección de cuentos, titulada The Interpreter of Maladies (1999), que la lanzó a la luz pública. Nacida en Londres de padres bengalíes, Lahiri fue a vivir a Rhode Island cuando tenía dos años. Demasiado consciente de su peculiar trasfondo cuando era niña, buscó refugio en la lectura. Pero fue ya de adulta, cuando estudiaba su doctorado en literatura, que se dio cuenta del poder de la escritura como medio de expresión y cambió su rumbo para proseguir una carrera como escritora.  La caricatura hecha por David Levine para acompañar una reseña del libro Unaccustomed Earth (2008) de Lahiri enfatiza su personalidad cerebral. Aquí la estrella es su intelecto. Al mismo tiempo, al presentarla en atuendo tradicional sentada en el piso con una computadora, Levine sugiere la dualidad identitaria Oriente/Occidente que Lahiri ha explorado en sus escritos. Su novela más reciente, The Lowlands (2013), fue finalista del Premio Nacional del Libro.     David Levine (1926–2009)  Tinta sobre grafito en papel, 2003"
119015,"On May 25, 1961—three weeks after the United States sent its first astronaut into suborbital flight—President John F. Kennedy issued an audacious challenge. Speaking before a joint session of Congress he declared, “This nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before the decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.” Eight years later, the crew of Apollo XI—astronauts Michael Collins (born 1930), Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin (born 1930) and Neil Armstrong (1930–2012)—fulfilled Kennedy’s challenge. On July 20, 1969, while Collins orbited the moon in the Command Module, mission commander Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Aldrin descended to the lunar surface. A short time later, Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon, followed shortly by Aldrin. The two later rejoined Collins in the Command Module and returned safely to earth with their Pacific splashdown on July 24, 1969."
119017,"During the 1940s, few could hope to match Ingrid Bergman’s popularity at the box office. Bergman was already a star in her native Sweden when she came to the United States in 1939 to make her Hollywood film debut in Intermezzo. She immediately captivated American audiences, who responded warmly to her luminous, natural beauty and the empathy she exuded on screen. Perhaps best remembered for her performance opposite Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca (1942), Bergman enjoyed a string of early successes, including Gaslight (for which she won the Academy Award for Best Actress in 1944), The Bells of St. Mary’s (1945), and Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound (1945) and Notorious (1946). Ostracized in 1950 when her much-publicized extramarital affair with Italian director Roberto Rossellini produced a child, Bergman did not resume her American film career until 1956, when her performance in Anastasia earned her another Oscar.  Karsh created this portrait on assignment for Life magazine in Hollywood."
119018,"Humphrey Bogart may have lacked the handsome features of a typical matinee idol, but that did not stop him from becoming one of the screen’s most memorable leading men. In 1935 he vaulted from Broadway to Hollywood on the strength of his performance as the brooding killer Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. Bogart re-created that role on film and went on to play assorted tough guys for Warner Brothers before his work in High Sierra and The Maltese Falcon (both released in 1941) revealed his capacity to portray characters whose toughness was tempered by a deep-seated vulnerability. Bogart perfected this dual persona in classics such as Casablanca (1942) with Ingrid Bergman and To Have and Have Not (1944) with Lauren Bacall. Honored with the Academy Award for his performance in The African Queen (1951), Bogart also earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of the demented Captain Queeg in The Caine Mutiny (1954)."
119020,"An innovative leader in the treatment of heart disease, surgeon Michael DeBakey helped inaugurate “a new era in cardiovascular surgery.” He was still in medical school when he designed a pump for use in blood transfusions; it later proved critical to the development of the heart-lung machines that made open-heart surgery possible. DeBakey also pioneered the use of Dacron fabric for vascular grafts and tubing. In the 1960s he led efforts to develop a mechanical pump—known as a ventricular assist device (VAD)—to support patients with failing heart function. Among the first to perform coronary bypasses, DeBakey made history in 1968 when he and his team transplanted four organs from a single donor to four different recipients. Known for his exacting standards, DeBakey was intolerant of assistants who made mistakes. “If you were on the operating table,” he asked, “would you want a perfectionist or someone who cared little for detail?”"
119021,"Cartoonist Walt Disney created a sensation in 1928 when he introduced Mickey Mouse to moviegoers in Steamboat Willie, the first animated short film to feature synchronized sound. The overnight success of the plucky rodent (whose voice was supplied by Walt himself) laid the foundation for Disney’s subsequent ventures. Besides the Mickey Mouse cartoons that became a staple of movie houses, Disney produced such popular animated shorts as The Three Little Pigs (1933). Gambling that a full-length animated feature could succeed with audiences, he put all his resources into such a project. The result was the 1937 release of the groundbreaking Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Disney would eventually create a family entertainment empire that included live action as well as classic animated films, television, and the Disneyland and Disney World theme parks.  Advised that Disneyland was Walt Disney’s “most cherished project,” Karsh made a special trip to the recently opened theme park before photographing its creator."
119024,"Clark Gable’s good looks, rough-edged masculinity, and roguish charm proved irresistible to moviegoers, who flocked to his films. Gable began his career on the stage and played bit parts in silent movies before making his debut in talking pictures in 1931. Initially cast in supporting roles, Gable quickly achieved leading-man status at MGM, where he appeared opposite box office favorites such as Jean Harlow, Joan Crawford, and Jeanette MacDonald in films that included Red Dust (1932), Dancing Lady (1933), and San Francisco (1936). On loan to Columbia Pictures in 1934, Gable won the Academy Award for his delightful performance in the Frank Capra comedy It Happened One Night. His most memorable role came several years later, when he starred as Rhett Butler in the Civil War epic Gone with the Wind (1939). During World War II, Gable enlisted in the Army Air Forces, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross for his service."
119026,"The undisputed “master of suspense,” London-born Alfred Hitchcock began his career in the British film industry in 1920, advancing rapidly from title artist to art director before making his directorial debut with The Pleasure Garden in 1925. During a highly creative period from 1934 to 1938, Hitchcock directed a string of stellar films, including The 39 Steps (1935) and The Lady Vanishes (1938), which caught the attention of American movie executives. Hitchcock signed a contract with famed producer David O. Selznick in 1939 and moved to Hollywood, where his first American project, Rebecca, captured the Best Picture Oscar in 1940. Throughout the decades that followed, Hitchcock’s films—from Notorious (1946) to Rear Window (1954) to Psycho (1960)—set new standards both for suspense and cinematic innovation. He also enjoyed success in the emerging medium of television with the long-running weekly series Alfred Hitchcock Presents, which premiered in 1955—the year that Hitchcock became an American citizen."
119028,"A man constantly on the move, Martin Luther King was most often photographed in action by those covering the events of the civil-rights movement. This likeness by renowned portraitist Yousuf Karsh is a different kind of image—a formal portrait that utilizes pose and lighting rather than environment to identify King as a leader and a visionary. Karsh made the photograph in August 1962, when King returned to Atlanta following the prolonged and dispiriting struggle for desegregation in Albany, Georgia. With very little time to work, Karsh photographed his subject in the only space available—a corner of King’s Ebenezer Baptist Church. Recalling the circumstances of that sitting, Karsh noted, ""Nowhere could [King] relax when constantly beset by friends and aides wishing him well, commiserating on his difficulties, congratulating him on his return, and planning new strategy."""
119030,"On March 3, 1923, the modern news magazine was born when Henry Luce and Briton Hadden released the first issue of Time. A highly readable weekly digest of news, opinion, and public interest stories, the magazine struck a chord with readers and laid the foundation for Luce’s future success. With Hadden’s death in 1929, Luce gained majority control of Time Inc. and proceeded with plans for a second publication. In February 1930 he defied conventional wisdom by launching a business magazine, Fortune, in the wake of the devastating stock market crash of 1929. An even more ambitious venture lay ahead in 1936, when Luce introduced Life, the first American magazine to embrace the concept of reporting news through photographic essays. The phenomenal success of Luce’s publishing empire, which grew to include Sports Illustrated (1954), made him one of the nation’s most influential media moguls."
119031,"On stage and in the movies, the Marx Brothers entertained audiences with their madcap escapades and gleefully irreverent assaults on authority. A family act that originated in vaudeville, the Marx Brothers—Groucho, Harpo, Chico, and straight man Zeppo (who would leave the ensemble in 1933)—scored their first Broadway success in the 1924 production I’ll Say She Is. The hit shows that followed—The Cocoanuts and Animal Crackers—inaugurated the brothers’ talking pictures career when both musical comedies were adapted for the screen. Moviegoers savored the antics of Groucho, the greasepaint-mustachioed punster; laughed at the hijinks of Harpo, the mute, harp-playing mischief maker; and delighted in the comic ramblings of Chico, the pseudo-Italian immigrant. With memorable performances in classics such as Duck Soup (1933) and A Night at the Opera (1935), the Marx Brothers upended convention and invigorated American comedy.  Karsh created this portrait in Hollywood while on assignment for Life magazine."
119032,"A towering figure in the history of broadcasting, Edward R. Murrow achieved international acclaim, first as a radio news correspondent and later as a pioneer in the emerging medium of television. Murrow began his career with the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) in 1935 and was assigned to head the radio network’s European bureau in London in 1937. When war engulfed Europe and Hitler’s bombs rained down on Britain, Murrow remained at his London post. He assembled a superb roster of war correspondents for CBS and brought the conflict into American living rooms with his own vivid eyewitness reports that kept listeners glued to their radios. After the war, Murrow transitioned to television with See It Now—his groundbreaking documentary series that featured both in-depth reporting and news analysis. It was via the program’s March 9, 1954, broadcast that Murrow helped to discredit Senator Joseph McCarthy’s anti-Communist campaign by exposing the senator’s unsavory tactics."
119033,"Robert Oppenheimer was the obvious choice to lead the principal laboratory of the Manhattan Project—the United States’s secret effort to develop an atomic bomb during World War II. A brilliant physicist, Oppenheimer was known for his ability to build trust and foster collaboration—skills that proved vital in forging successful working relationships between the project’s scientists and the military. A little more than two years after he took charge of the laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico, the first atomic bomb was exploded at a test site near Alamogordo on July 16, 1945. After the war, Oppenheimer supported an unsuccessful initiative to place atomic energy under international control. His opposition to U.S. development of the hydrogen bomb—which put him at odds with the Atomic Energy Commission—was one of the contributing factors in the loss of his security clearance in 1954. Thereafter, Oppenheimer was barred from further work on nuclear projects. "
119035,"One of the most influential architects to emerge in the decades following World War II, I. M. Pei is recognized throughout the world for his striking, high-modernist designs. Drawn to the United States to study architecture in 1935, Pei earned his undergraduate degree from MIT and later completed graduate work at Harvard. After first directing the architectural division of a large real-estate concern, Pei founded his own architecture firm in 1955, one year after becoming a U.S. citizen. As his reputation grew, important projects—such as the 1964 commission for the John F. Kennedy Memorial Library—came his way. Pei went on to create such iconic structures as the critically acclaimed East Wing of the National Gallery of Art (1978) and the distinctive glass pyramid that forms the entrance to the Louvre (1988). He has received many major awards, including the coveted Pritzker Prize (1983)."
119036,"As the nation’s first lady, Eleanor Roosevelt rapidly expanded her role from hostess to advocate and emerged as a vital force in her husband Franklin’s administration. She took public stands on issues ranging from exploitive labor practices to civil rights, but more important, she often urged her husband toward measures he might otherwise have avoided. When the challenges of World War II drew the president’s attention from domestic affairs, she continued to be a strong voice for the New Deal’s social welfare policies. The activism that characterized Eleanor Roosevelt’s years as first lady did not end with her departure from the White House. As a U.S. delegate to the United Nations (1945–53), she was instrumental in formulating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and securing its ratification by the General Assembly in 1948.  Eleanor Roosevelt’s hands were seldom still, and Karsh captured their expressive qualities in this portrait. "
119039,"One of the nation’s foremost men of letters, John Updike chronicled postwar suburban life and middle-class angst in a plethora of works that included the acclaimed novel Rabbit, Run (1960) and its multiple sequels—two of which were awarded Pulitzer Prizes. Written in a prose style notable for its lyricism, wit, and penchant for minute detail, Updike’s Rabbit novels trace the restless existence of Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, a former small-town basketball star whose troubled life plays out against the history-making events that shaped the latter decades of the twentieth century. An astonishingly prolific and multifaceted writer, Updike was widely regarded as “the spirit of the New Yorker”—the magazine that launched his career and long served as a primary outlet for his poetry, essays, criticism, and masterful short stories.  When Karsh photographed Updike at home in the seaside town of Beverly Farms, Massachusetts, the writer “playfully spoke of the spirits abiding in older houses and older rooms.”"
119041,"Playwright Tennessee Williams took American theater into new territory with powerful dramas that explored themes of sexuality, violence, and what Williams described as “the destructive impact of society on the sensitive, nonconformist individual.” He drew heavily on memories of his unhappy youth and dysfunctional family in crafting such works as The Glass Menagerie (1945), his first Broadway success. Two years later, he won the Pulitzer Prize for A Streetcar Named Desire (1947) and earned a second Pulitzer with Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (1955)—both of which were made into popular films. His last major play, The Night of the Iguana, opened in 1961. Williams continued to write, but his later efforts never approached the success of his earlier works; the final decades of his life were marred by depression, alcohol, and drugs.  Karsh observed that Williams’s demeanor “reminded me of various characters made by his pen—ordinary-looking men hiding an unsuspected fury.” "
119043,"In the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, industrial designer Russel Wright introduced modernism to countless American households with tableware, pottery, furniture, and home accessories that combined style and functionality with affordability. Wright began his career designing theatrical sets but turned to industrial design in the early 1930s when he created and marketed a series of handsome spun-aluminum serving pieces. In 1935 he unveiled his enormously successful “Modern Living” line of mass-produced furniture, which was notable for its solid maple construction and its clean, contemporary look. In keeping with his belief that housewares should reflect the growing informality of everyday living and entertaining, Wright debuted his colorful “Modern American” ceramic dinnerware in 1939 and later introduced his highly durable “Casual China” (1946) for home use. In 1951 Wright and his wife published Mary and Russel Wright’s Guide to Easier Living, a book to help readers adapt to changing lifestyles in postwar America."
119044,"Known throughout the fashion industry as “a designer’s designer,” Geoffrey Beene earned an appreciative following and numerous awards for his chic, superbly tailored creations. Beene planned to pursue a medical career but dropped out of college after realizing that he preferred sketching evening gowns to studying anatomy. When a job in the display department of a high-end clothing store in Los Angeles convinced him that his future lay in fashion, Beene moved to New York City in 1947 to study design. After further training in Paris, he returned to New York in 1949 and worked for a number of fashion houses before establishing his own label in 1963. Beene not only set new standards in American couture with his minimalist designs and imaginative mixing of fabrics; he became one of the first American designers to produce a successful line of ready-to-wear clothing when he launched his sporty “Beene Bag” line in 1971."
119045,"In 1963, when Katharine Graham succeeded her late husband as president of her family’s media company and its flagship newspaper, the Washington Post, she faced innumerable challenges. Women executives were still a rarity in corporate America, and Graham harbored grave doubts about her ability to captain the Washington Post Company. She would prove more than equal to the task; under her guidance the Post was transformed from a local news source into one of the world’s most respected newspapers. Working closely with executive editor Ben Bradlee (whom she brought on board in 1965), Graham took a bold stand for press freedom in 1971 by publishing the Pentagon Papers, a classified account of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. The following year, the Post launched the investigative reporting that ultimately exposed the Nixon administration’s culpability in the Watergate scandal and earned the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize (1973). Graham later received a Pulitzer for her memoir, Personal History (1998). "
119047,"Albert Einstein transformed the world of physics with his groundbreaking theory of relativity, and in 1921 he received the Nobel Prize for “his services to theoretical physics” and “his discovery of the law of photoelectric effect.” The German-born physicist was visiting the United States when Hitler and the Nazis came to power in his homeland in 1933. Einstein never returned to Germany. Instead, he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey—the newly established academic institution that would become a major center for research in theoretical physics. In residence at the institute for the remainder of his life, Einstein continued to publish, work on the interpretation of quantum theory, and wrestle without success on his unified field theory. He became a U.S. citizen in 1940.  Karsh relished the opportunity to photograph Einstein, whose face, “in all its rough grandeur, invited and challenged the camera.”"
119048,"Internationally acclaimed contralto Marian Anderson became a powerful symbol in the American struggle for racial equality in the spring of 1939, when the Daughters of the American Revolution barred her from performing at Washington’s Constitution Hall. Responding to the D.A.R.’s actions, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt renounced her membership in the organization and helped make it possible for Anderson to perform instead at the Lincoln Memorial before a crowd of 75,000. One of the twentieth century’s most outstanding singers, Anderson was admired for the rich timbre and exceptional range of her voice, as well as for the deep feeling with which she sang. Long in demand as a concert artist both at home and abroad, Anderson became the first African American to sing at New York’s Metropolitan Opera on January 7, 1955.   In photographing Anderson, Karsh captured the quiet dignity that was an essential part of her character."
119049,"Decades before makeovers and day spas were commonplace, Elizabeth Arden built a beauty and cosmetics business that became a lucrative global enterprise. In 1909 Canadian-born Florence Graham opened a beauty salon in New York City under the name “Elizabeth Arden.” At a time when most “respectable” women were hesitant to use cosmetics, Arden made such products acceptable by introducing them as part of the beauty regimen she offered to the well-heeled clients who patronized her Fifth Avenue establishment. She soon expanded her business by developing a signature line of highly profitable beauty products, which were sold in her growing empire of red-doored salons and marketed widely through drug and department stores. Admonishing women to “Hold fast to life and youth,” Arden included exercise programs and nutritional advice among her salon services and also created several full-fledged spa retreats. One of her generation’s most successful entrepreneurs, Arden retained sole ownership of her business until her death."
119054,"Born Omaha, Nebraska  Warren Buffett is one of the most successful contemporary businessmen and investors; he is regularly listed as one of the wealthiest people in the world because of the success of his investment firm, Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett is known for his patience and belief in long-term value investing. He is also personally frugal and modest, befitting a man who made his stake in the business world by saving nearly $10,000 by 1950, when he was twenty. Buffett started out in the insurance industry but branched out into investment partnerships, which he then consolidated into Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett acquired this textile firm in 1962 but sold the manufacturing plant to concentrate on investments only. Buffett has pledged to give most of his immense wealth to philanthropy in his will."
119061,"With his development of the first safe and effective vaccine against polio, virologist Jonas Salk became a hero to millions. In the early 1940s, Salk and esteemed fellow scientist Thomas Francis Jr. revolutionized immunology with their killed-virus vaccine for influenza, which produced protective antibodies without exposing recipients to the live virus itself. Spurred by the success of the influenza vaccine, Salk began working in 1947 to produce a vaccine for polio, a viral infection capable of killing or severely crippling its victims, especially young children. With crucial support from what is now the March of Dimes, he initiated experiments with killed-virus vaccines, reporting positive results in 1953. An extensive field trial followed, and on April 12, 1955, it was announced to the public that Salk’s polio vaccine had proven effective, powerful, and safe—an achievement hailed by the American Medical Association as “one of the greatest events in the history of medicine.”"
119062,"Writer and activist Elie Wiesel has dedicated his life to ensuring that the Holocaust and its victims are never forgotten. A survivor of the concentration camps that claimed the lives of his parents and younger sister, Wiesel vowed not to speak of the Holocaust for a decade after the war. He broke his silence at the urging of French writer and Nobel laureate François Mauriac. In 1960, Night—Wiesel’s powerful memoir recounting the horrors of the Nazi death camps—was published in English. He has since written more than thirty books, while also serving as a vocal advocate for human rights throughout the world. Honored with the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, Wiesel declared, “I have tried to keep memory alive. . . . I have tried to fight those who would forget. Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices.”  Wiesel’s book-lined study served as the setting for this portrait."
119068,"Jacqueline Kennedy brought grace and style to her role as first lady and inspired the nation and the world with her courage and dignity in the aftermath of her husband’s assassination. Jacqueline Bouvier was working as an “inquiring camera girl” for the Washington Times-Herald when she began dating Congressman John F. Kennedy in 1952. That November, Kennedy won a Senate seat, and the couple married the following year. They welcomed daughter Caroline’s arrival in 1957, and in 1960, shortly after her husband’s election as president, Jacqueline Kennedy gave birth to John Jr. Just thirty-one when she became first lady, she won admiration for her efforts to make the White House a showplace for the nation’s history and culture. After President Kennedy was killed in 1963, she remained the focus of intense public interest. Married to Aristotle Onassis in 1968 and widowed in 1975, she subsequently built a successful career in publishing."
119070,"In 1947 Jackie Robinson forever changed professional sports by becoming the first African American player in major league baseball. A trailblazer for equal opportunity, Robinson endured torrents of abuse in his first season with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Some of his own teammates mounted an abortive effort to have him dropped from the roster, while opponents and spectators alike taunted, heckled, and harassed him. Robinson steeled himself and responded with electrifying play that carried the Dodgers to a National League championship and earned him honors as Rookie of the Year. One of the top draws in baseball during ten memorable seasons, Robinson led the Dodgers to six pennants and one World Series title. He also paved the way for black major leaguers such as Willie Mays and Hank Aaron and remained a staunch advocate for civil rights after retiring from the game."
119073,"Harland Sanders perfected his signature fried chicken in 1939 while operating a gas station, motel, and roadside café in rural Corbin, Kentucky. Traditional fried chicken took as long as thirty minutes to cook, but Sanders discovered he could produce a juicy, flavorful product in as little as eight to nine minutes by using one of the newly introduced pressure cookers. His distinctive chicken remained the café’s principal attraction until 1956, when Sanders sold the business after learning that a new interstate highway would bypass Corbin by seven miles. Armed with pressure cookers and his secret blend of “eleven herbs and spices,” the sixty-six-year-old Sanders took to the road to build a franchise network for his unique “Kentucky Fried Chicken.” He met with phenomenal success. In 1964, when Sanders sold the majority of his holdings for $2 million, there were 900 Kentucky Fried Chicken outlets in the United States, Canada, England, and Japan."
119074,"Broadcasting industry leader David Sarnoff learned Morse code when he was fifteen and later became an operator with the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America. In April 1912, while managing a Marconi station in New York City, Sarnoff received telegraphed reports of the Titanic’s sinking and broke the news to the press. Appointed general manager of the newly formed Radio Corporation of America (RCA) in 1921, he convinced the company to develop and manufacture a “radio music box” for home use. Sales of RCA radios reached $83.5 million in 1924, and two years later Sarnoff launched the National Broadcasting Company (NBC)—the first nationwide radio network. An early believer in the feasibility of broadcasting images as well as sound, he committed RCA to developing this technology. At the opening of the 1939 New York World’s Fair, Sarnoff—now RCA’s president—ushered in the television era with the first public demonstration of the new medium."
119075,"Isamu Noguchi garnered international acclaim as a versatile sculptor who created evocative works in media ranging from stone and steel to clay and paper. The son of a Japanese father and an American mother, Noguchi addressed his dual ethnicity through art that was informed by both Eastern and Western aesthetic traditions. He embraced abstraction in response to the pure forms of modernist sculptor Constantin Brancusi, but until the early 1940s, Noguchi was best known for his figurative portrait sculpture. In 1935 he created the first of many striking stage sets for dancer-choreographer Martha Graham and later produced a mammoth stainless steel relief for the Associated Press Building in Rockefeller Center (1938). During World War II, Noguchi spent six months in a Japanese American relocation camp. In the postwar period, his work grew to include landscape design, while his sculpture ranged from the monumental to delicate, lantern-like forms.”"
119078,"As Chief Justice of the United States (1953–69), Earl Warren played a pivotal role in crafting a series of landmark rulings by the Supreme Court during a period of tremendous social change. A former Republican vice-presidential candidate (1948), California governor (1943–53), and attorney general (1939–43), Warren was named to the Court by President Dwight Eisenhower and joined that body as it wrestled with Brown v. Board of Education. The justices were deeply divided over the case, which challenged the constitutionality of public school segregation. But Warren brought them together to forge a unanimous opinion which held that “in the field of public education, the doctrine of ‘separate but equal’ has no place.” In subsequent ground-breaking rulings, the Warren Court struck down race-based restrictions to voting (1965), marriage (1967), and housing (1968); it also barred state-sanctioned prayer in public schools (1961) and enumerated the “Miranda rights” of those under arrest (1966). "
119080,"An influential figure in relations between the United States and Nationalist China for many years, Madame Chiang Kai-shek rose to international prominence in the 1930s. The daughter of one of mainland China’s most prosperous families, Soong Mei-ling became that nation’s first lady in 1928 when her husband, Nationalist Party member General Chiang Kai-shek, claimed China’s leadership. In 1937, as Chiang’s Nationalists fought Mao Zedong’s Communists for control of the government, Japanese forces attacked China. During the conflagration that followed, American-educated Madame Chiang proved instrumental in securing vital Western support for China, including a $500 million loan from the United States in 1942. After the Communists came to power in post–World War II China (1949), Madame Chiang remained her husband’s interlocutor with the West as he led the rival Republic of China in Taiwan. Following Chiang Kai-shek’s death in 1975, Madame Chiang moved to the United States, where she remained until her death."
119085,"Georgia O’Keeffe joined the ranks of America’s leading modernists in 1916 with her first exhibition at 291, the New York gallery of celebrated photographer and arts impresario Alfred Stieglitz. Inspired by the avant-garde theories of artist and teacher Arthur Wesley Dow—who championed the expressive use of line, color, and tonality—the classically schooled O’Keeffe readily abandoned realism for the creative possibilities of abstraction. Her career flourished under the mentorship of Stieglitz, who introduced the public to her evocative paintings in annual exhibitions from 1923 to 1946. After marrying Stieglitz in 1924, O’Keeffe maintained a strong level of personal and artistic independence. Beginning in 1929, she lived and worked for extended periods in New Mexico, where she settled permanently after Stieglitz’s death in 1946. It was there that she created many of her most iconic works.  O’Keeffe’s austere adobe home in Abiquiu, New Mexico, provided the setting for Karsh’s profile study of the artist."
119086,"A titan of the industrial labor movement, John L. Lewis captained the powerful United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) for forty turbulent years (1920–60). Still in his teens when he began work as a coal miner, Lewis joined the UMWA and rose steadily through its ranks. By the time he was elected president, the union was the largest in the American Federation of Labor (AFL). The first decade of his leadership proved difficult as overproduction of coal triggered plummeting wages and job losses for miners. But Lewis turned the tide in 1933 by influencing labor codes in the New Deal’s National Recovery Administration to benefit coal workers. In 1935, after the AFL resisted his push to organize blue-collar workers by industry rather than craft, the ever-combative Lewis formed what became the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and led its bitter but successful struggles to unionize the steel and automotive industries."
119088,"Paul Robeson united great talent with a commitment to justice in a career that won him recognition and respect throughout the world. Educated at Rutgers University—where he was class valedictorian and a two-time football All-American—and Columbia Law School, Robeson sought greater opportunity than the legal profession then offered African Americans. In 1924 he established his acting career with starring roles in Eugene O’Neill’s The Emperor Jones and All God’s Chillun Got Wings. He also earned international acclaim later that decade for his concert performances of African American spirituals. For more than thirty years, Robeson traveled throughout the United States and Europe, appearing on stage, in film, and in concert. Speaking out against racial and economic injustice throughout his career, he often faced hostility as a consequence of his political views, especially in the years following World War II.   Karsh remarked that Robeson’s “mobility of expression made him a fascinating subject.”"
119089,"When Muhammad Ali proclaimed “I am the greatest,” his words rang true. Only twenty-two years old when he stunned the boxing world by upsetting heavyweight champion Sonny Liston in 1964, Ali (born Cassius Clay) would become the first three-time winner of the heavyweight crown. A consummate showman whose braggadocio and rhyming banter captivated the public, the fleet-footed and graceful Ali was mesmerizing as he confounded opponents with his unorthodox boxing style. Ali was also a potent force beyond the ring. In 1967 he became a symbol of conscience to many when he was convicted of draft evasion and stripped of his title after refusing military induction on the basis of his religious beliefs. The Supreme Court later overturned the conviction, and Ali battled back in the ring to regain the heavyweight title in 1974.  Karsh photographed Ali for Look magazine as part of a series focusing on young people."
119090,"Taking office in 1933 against the bleak backdrop of the Great Depression, Franklin Roosevelt (1882–1945) responded quickly to this economic disaster with a host of regulatory and welfare measures that redefined the government’s role in American life. Among conservatives, the new federal involvement in matters traditionally left to the private sector was seen as a betrayal of American ideals. But in other quarters, Roosevelt’s activism inspired an unwavering popularity that led to his election to an unprecedented four terms.  During a state visit to Canada in July 1936, Roosevelt delivered an address and met for talks with Baron Tweedsmuir, governor general of Canada, and Canadian prime minister Mackenzie King. When the three men, accompanied by Roosevelt’s eldest son, posed stiffly for a group portrait on the terrace of the Citadel in Quebec City, Karsh pretended to click the shutter. Almost immediately, the quartet relaxed and it was only then that Karsh snapped this picture."
119093,"A strikingly original architect, Frank Lloyd Wright designed a number of the twentieth century’s most distinctive and memorable buildings. Wright first attracted notice for residential designs whose open floor plans, horizontal orientation, regional building materials, and careful site integration reflected his commitment to “organic architecture.” This concept found its finest expression in Fallingwater (1939), the woodland retreat in Pennsylvania that Wright cantilevered over a rushing waterfall. He also earned acclaim for his highly innovative commercial buildings, from Tokyo’s Imperial Hotel (1922) to the Johnson Wax offices in Racine, Wisconsin (1939). In the wake of such successes came many others, including Wright’s “Usonian” experiments to create modestly priced housing without sacrificing aesthetic excellence.   During his portrait sitting with Karsh, Wright talked about a variety of subjects, including the designs he was then working on for an inverted spiral structure that would become the home of New York’s Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. "
119094,"Medical writer and historian Estrellita Nachbar was serving as editor to Dr. Walter C. Alvarez, the esteemed physician, author, and syndicated medical columnist, when she was introduced to Yousuf Karsh during his portrait sitting with her colleague and mentor. Karsh found Estrellita “fascinating” from the moment they met, and after a long-distance courtship the two were married in 1962. With her vivacity and keen intellect, Estrellita brought fresh focus and energy to her husband’s life and work. He, in turn, encouraged her to continue her own rewarding career—one fueled by her combined passions for art and medical history. Her work ranged from collaborating with doctors to write books that communicated complex medical concepts in engaging and accessible prose to curating an exhibition of work by physician-artists. Always her husband’s greatest supporter, she now honors his memory through a host of philanthropic initiatives in the arts.  Karsh created this serene portrait of Estrellita on her fortieth birthday."
119096,"Destined to become one of the screen’s most glamorous and enduring stars, Joan Crawford was dancing in the chorus of a Broadway revue when an MGM talent scout discovered her in 1924. She began her movie career with appearances in a number of minor silent films before soaring to stardom in 1928 with her exuberant tabletop performance of the Charleston in Our Dancing Daughters. Crawford successfully navigated the changeover to talking pictures and starred throughout the 1930s with many of Hollywood’s top leading men, including Fred Astaire and Clark Gable. Initially cast as a glamour girl by MGM, she moved to Warner Brothers in 1943, where she fought successfully for more serious and challenging parts. Crawford soon gained respect as an accomplished actress and was honored with the Academy Award in 1945 for her moving portrayal of the title character in the popular melodrama Mildred Pierce."
119098,"A luminous beauty whose film career spanned just six years (1951–56), Grace Kelly left an indelible legacy with her performances in eleven motion pictures, many of which remain Hollywood classics. After her 1951 film debut in a minor role, she received wide notice for her performance opposite Gary Cooper in High Noon (1952). A year later, Kelly garnered her first Academy Award nomination for her work in Mogambo (1953). In 1954 she starred in four major releases, including the Alfred Hitchcock thrillers Dial M for Murder and Rear Window, and the drama The Country Girl, for which she won the Best Actress Oscar. Kelly scored additional hits with To Catch a Thief (1955) and the musical High Society (1956) before ending her Hollywood career to marry Monaco’s Prince Rainier in April 1956.  When Grace Kelly posed for Karsh’s camera, she was recently engaged and about to begin her new life as Monaco’s Princess Grace."
119099,"Choreographer Jerome Robbins moved seamlessly between the worlds of ballet and Broadway musicals, infusing each with his energy, talent, and imagination. After dancing in several Broadway shows, Robbins joined the new Ballet Theatre (later American Ballet Theatre) in 1940 but felt constrained by its Russian-dominated repertory. Eager to bring an American sensibility to the company, he collaborated with composer Leonard Bernstein to create Fancy Free (1944)—a vibrant ballet about three sailors enjoying shore leave in New York. This critically acclaimed work launched Robbins’s career in choreography and was adapted for Broadway as the highly successful musical On the Town. With subsequent hits such as The King and I (1951), West Side Story (1957), and Fiddler on the Roof (1964), Robbins secured his reputation as one of musical theater’s great innovators. He also created significant works for George Balanchine’s New York City Ballet during a long and fruitful association with that company."
119100,"A seminal figure in the evolution of modern American dance, Martha Graham rejected   literal imagery in favor of abstraction, and introduced powerful new forms of expressive movement filled with tension and emotion. In a quest to give “visible substance to things felt,” Graham created more than 180 works, including the groundbreaking Lamentation (1930), in which the dancer—encased in a tube of stretchable fabric—sought to embody grief itself through dramatic, angular gestures. Equally memorable was Graham’s Appalachian Spring (1944), choreographed to music created expressly for her by Aaron Copland. As founder and director of the Martha Graham Dance Company, Graham also trained the next wave of modern dancers, choreographers, and teachers, among them Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor.  When posing for Karsh’s camera, Graham was seated on a stool in her low-ceilinged New York apartment but “seemed to be dancing as if she had the space of a great stage around her.”"
119103,"Born Cheraw, South Carolina  Jazz trumpeter, composer, and bandleader John Birks “Dizzy” Gillespie first gained fame in the early 1940s, but his talent and staying power were such that he was still a dynamic presence on the music scene six decades later. Gillespie was barely out of his teens when he joined Cab Calloway’s legendary big band in 1939, yet the maturity of his playing was already undeniable. His solos enlivened many of Calloway’s recordings, and Gillespie’s innovative arrangements laid the groundwork for his future experiments in rhythm and composition. After meeting jazz saxophonist Charlie Parker in Kansas City in 1940, Gillespie joined Parker, pianist Thelonious Monk, and other young musicians in freewheeling jam sessions that spawned a new, energetic form of jazz known as bebop. Emerging rapidly as one of bebop’s greatest practitioners, Gillespie also played a pivotal role in introducing Afro-Cuban jazz to worldwide audiences. He toured extensively and was hailed as modern jazz’s most ebullient ambassador."
119105,"During a lifetime of service, Helen Keller demonstrated to the world that disabilities were not insurmountable barriers to achievement. After illness claimed her sight and hearing in early childhood, Keller overcame those challenges with the aid of Anne Sullivan, her dedicated teacher and companion. She mastered manual sign language and braille and also developed her ability to speak. When Keller graduated with honors from Radcliffe College in 1904, she had already published a best-seller—The Story of My Life (1902). Committed to the principles of equality and opportunity, Keller was active in reform movements and was an early supporter of the NAACP. Her most rewarding work, however, was advocating for those with disabilities. In 1924 she became the official spokesperson for the American Foundation for the Blind and later lobbied successfully to include a clause in the Social Security Act of 1935 that made the blind eligible for grant assistance. "
119192,"Born Paris, France  In 1936 Diana Vreeland became fashion editor of Harper’s Bazaar and began to make that magazine a sounding-board for contemporary American identity. ""Pizzazz"" was a favorite word, and everything she did reflected that sense of verve. Every month she wrote a column called ""Why Don’t You . . ."" in which she suggested such outlandish ideas as, ""Why don’t you . . . wash your blond child’s hair in dead champagne, as they do in France? . . . have a furry elk-hide trunk for the back of your car?"" She saw her duty as instructive: ""Most people haven’t got a point of view; they need to have it given to them."" In 1941 Vreeland herself modeled for photographer Louise Dahl-Wolfe during an Arizona photo shoot, posing in front of an abandoned movie set in an old Western town."
119275,"Justin Timberlake rose to prominence at a young age as a member of NSYNC during the era of packaged boy bands but has since emerged as a distinctive singer in his own right. His first solo album, Justified (2002), was successful worldwide, and its follow-ups, FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006) and The 20/20 Experience (2013), earned him critical acclaim as a musician for his skill at combining various styles. He has also become known as an actor, particularly for roles in The Social Network (2010) and Inside Llewyn Davis (2013).   Peggy Sirota captured this composite portrait of Timberlake for the “Most Stylish Men in America” issue of GQ in March 2009. He wears a T-shirt from his William Rast clothing line and a fedora, one of his signature styles. Timberlake is also a skilled dancer, which is suggested by the gestural quality of the poses in this photograph.  Justin Timberlake alcanzó prominencia a temprana edad como integrante de NSYNC en la época de los grupos de jovencitos cantantes “pre-empacados”, pero desde entonces se ha destacado como un cantante con individualidad propia. Su primer álbum como solista, Justified (2002), fue un éxito mundial, y con FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006) y The 20/20 Experience (2013) logró impresionar a los críticos como músico por su talento para combinar estilos diversos. También se ha dado a conocer como actor, sobre todo por sus papeles en las películas The Social Network (2010) y Inside Llewyn Davis (2013).  Peggy Sirota tomó este retrato compuesto de Timberlake para la edición de “los hombres con más estilo en Norteamérica” de la revista GQ, en marzo de 2009. Aquí lleva una camiseta de su línea de ropa William Rast y un sombrero de fieltro, uno de sus estilos característicos. Timberlake también es un diestro bailarín, como lo sugiere la gestualidad de las poses en esta fotografía."
119278,"Born in Los Chavez, New Mexico  Born to a family with deep Southwestern roots, Dennis Chavez was the first native-born Hispanic elected to the U.S. Senate. Although his schooling was cut short by his need to help support his family, he took night courses and worked for the city of Albuquerque as an engineer and later as a newspaper editor and translator. A job as a Spanish interpreter for a New Mexican politician led him to a job in Washington and a law degree from Georgetown. He entered the New Mexico legislature and was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1930, serving two terms. Chavez was appointed and then won a special election to the Senate in 1936; he won the 1940 election and served until he died. He was a solid, responsible senator who paid particular attention to his state and its people.  New York’s Puerto Rican community presented this portrait to Chavez to commemorate his twenty-fifth anniversary in the Senate."
119791,"Born Oxford, Massachusetts  Clara Barton considered herself foremost a relief worker, whose efforts to aid those in need consumed most of her adult life. Yet she is remembered best as a Civil War nurse and as the founder of the American Red Cross. During the war, Barton realized her true calling of service by organizing and distributing supplies to Union soldiers and visiting the fields of battle as an independent nurse. At war’s end, she organized a missing soldiers office, answering thousands of inquiries from bereaved families about their loved ones. When she closed the office in 1867, she had identified the fate of some 22,000 men. Later, after attending a European meeting of the International Red Cross, Barton returned home and worked to found the American Red Cross in 1881. She served as its first president for the next twenty-three years. "
119792,"Born Bellevue, Nebraska  An important advocate of Native American rights, Susette LaFlesche Tibbles was raised on the Omaha reservation in Nebraska. She worked as a teacher before becoming involved in a study of social conditions among the Plains tribes. She was accompanied in this work by Thomas Tibbles, a newspaper editor whom she married in 1887. Galvanized by the terrible conditions she observed, “Bright Eyes,” as she came to be known, served as an expert witness and worked as an interpreter in court cases that Native peoples brought against the federal government. She also received widespread fame as an orator, speaking out about the lack of rights afforded tribes."
119793,"Born Joseph Saddler and raised in the Bronx, in a family with a big record collection, the young Flash became an expert and innovative DJ at New York’s dance and nightclubs; he pioneered the use of two turntables, sampling and “scratching” the needle back and forth on the vinyl. In the 1970s he fronted several pioneering rap and hip-hop ensembles, taking the name Grandmaster Flash. Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five was formed in 1979. Among their hits was “The Message” (1982), which abandoned dance beats for a grim tour of inner-city life, a shift in tone adopted by other hip-hop artists.  Flash poses here with Talking Heads and Tom Tom Club bassist Tina Weymouth. Flash sampled Tom Tom Club’s “Genius of Love” on “It’s Nasty,” and this was their first meeting. Note the now comically oversized boom boxes, a fixture of 1970s urban culture."
121054,"At the beginning of the 1950s, artist Helen Frankenthaler drew inspiration from Jackson Pollock’s radical drip painting technique to develop her own unorthodox mode of applying paint to canvas. Like Pollock, she began by spreading a sheet of unprimed cotton duck on the floor of her studio. But instead of dripping or flinging paint across its surface, she thinned her pigments to create washes that soaked into the canvas and formed translucent veils and glowing blocks of color. Frankenthaler’s first work to feature this technique—Mountains and Sea (1952)—was a revelation for the Washington-based painter Morris Louis, who later described it as “the bridge between Pollock and what was possible.” Those who followed Frankenthaler’s lead and adopted her soak-stain technique became part of the emerging movement known as color field painting, which flourished into the 1960s. Speaking of her work Frankenthaler observed, “Every canvas is a journey all its own.”"
121056,"In the course of his musical career, Aaron Copland distinguished himself as a conductor, teacher, and critic. But his greatest accomplishments by far were in the field of composing. Long regarded as the dean of American composers, Copland received his training in Paris. His grounding in European music, however, did not diminish his interest in exploring the musical styles and traditions of his own country. In fact, his compositions drew much of their inspiration from American sources, ranging from jazz to cowboy ballads to New England hymns. Copland’s prodigious output included operas, ballets, choral pieces, film scores, and symphonies. Among his best-known works are Appalachian Spring (1943), a ballet commissioned for Martha Graham’s dance company, and his Third Symphony (1944–46), which conductor Serge Koussevitsky called the “greatest American symphony.”  Karsh responded warmly to Copland, observing, “There was about him a certain candour and friendliness that endeared him to me at once.”"
121057,"A transformative force in the American labor movement, Cesar Chavez dedicated his life to the struggle to secure fair wages and decent working conditions for the nation’s agricultural workers. Chavez had toiled as a migrant in his youth and was well acquainted with the hardships endured by seasonal laborers—many of them Mexican or Mexican American—who followed the harvest on farms throughout California and the Southwest. In 1962, he partnered with activist Dolores Huerta to co-found the forerunner of the United Farm Workers of America (UFW)—the first successful farm workers’ union in the nation. In 1965 Chavez initiated a massive boycott of California grapes in a campaign that continued for five years and ended in victory when grape- growers agreed to accept unionized field workers.  Photographed at his headquarters in California, Chavez stands in a doorway bordered by Aztec eagles—the UFW’s symbol, which Chavez helped to design."
121060,"A superb salesman with keen entrepreneurial instincts, International Business Machines (IBM) chief Thomas J. Watson built his company into a blue-chip powerhouse. Watson honed his executive skills with the National Cash Register Company before moving to the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company in 1913. Assuming CTR’s presidency a year later, he initiated a major expansion and launched a dynamic research and development program to engineer the next generation of tabulating devices. As Watson grew the company—which changed its name to IBM in 1924—he fostered a corporate culture in which customer service was paramount, and well-trained, highly motivated employees received good pay, job security, and generous benefits. Under Watson’s leadership, IBM helped usher in the computer age in 1944 by financing and building the Harvard Mark 1—the first automatic digital calculator in the United States and the largest electromechanical calculator ever produced.  Watson is pictured beneath the sign proclaiming IBM’s motivational mantra, “THINK.”"
121061,"Artist and cultural provocateur Andy Warhol reveled in pushing the boundaries of art-making by producing works that challenged traditional conceptions of fine art. Following his success in the 1950s as a graphic artist specializing in advertising and illustration, Warhol shifted his focus to representational painting and printmaking in the 1960s. Utilizing photo-based techniques mastered in his commercial work, he appropriated imagery from consumer and popular culture—from soup cans to film stills—to create many of Pop Art’s most iconic works. Intrigued by the concept of mechanized art production, Warhol dubbed his New York studio “The Factory” and immersed himself in serial projects that reflected his fascination with celebrity and featured pioneering work in film and video.  During the session with Karsh that yielded this portrait, Warhol turned the tables by snapping pictures of the photographer. “I know how my paintings will look,” Warhol remarked, “but photographs are always a surprise to me.”"
121062,"From the earliest years of her career, singer and activist Joan Baez has maintained an unwavering commitment to social, political, and humanitarian causes. A vital force in the folk music revival of the 1950s and 1960s, Baez was in her teens when she began singing and playing the guitar in Boston-area coffeehouses. Her performances at the 1959 and 1960 Newport Folk Festivals won her legions of fans and were followed by the release of a series of immensely popular recordings. Baez’s immersion in the civil rights movement was reflected in her growing repertoire of protest songs, and in 1963 she performed at the March on Washington. Strongly opposed to the Vietnam War, Baez participated in numerous antiwar protests. Jailed for “disturbing the peace,” she later explained that she was “trying to disturb the war.”   Baez came to this portrait session directly from Stanford University, where she had helped defuse tensions that threatened to spark an antiwar riot. "
121085,"Born New York City  Called “the King of Latin Soul,” Joe Bataan was born to an African American mother and Filipino father and raised in Spanish Harlem. He began his musical career singing do-wop on street corners in the 1950s. By the late 1960s, he had developed a style that combined Latin music with rhythm and blues. With his first hit song, “Gypsy Woman,” recorded in 1967 for La Fania Records, he became the first artist to be credited with creating Latin soul music, a blend of mambo and pop with R&B and Latin jazz. When Latin soul faded in the 1970s, he joined the Disco mania and had a big 1979 hit with “Rap-O, Clap-O,” the first rap Disco hit. In this publicity image from 1965, Bataan appears seated but commanding, surrounded by his Latin Swingers band. "
121188,"Born Kosciusko, Mississippi      Artist Mickalene Thomas created a double portrait of Oprah Winfrey and Condoleeza Rice to emphasize how both African American women overcame obstacles throughout their lives. For Winfrey, she uses her characteristic rhinestones to highlight the multimedia mogul’s megawatt smile and verve. Winfrey’s confident gaze telegraphs her knack for connecting with others, be they celebrities or ordinary citizens.  Winfrey catapulted to fame in 1986 with her self-named talk show, a daily telecast that ran for twenty-five years, winning multiple awards. Building on the devotion of viewers everywhere, she turned to recommending books, promoting self-help, and creating HARPO studios, a magazine, and a television network. Born to an impoverished single mother, Winfrey has become an influential media leader and philanthropist. She has also given acclaimed performances in The Color Purple (1985) and Lee Daniels’ The Butler (2013). Awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2013, Winfrey recently produced Selma, a movie about the life of Martin Luther King Jr.    When Ends Meet—Oprah Winfrey  Oprah Winfrey nacida en 1954  Nacida en Kosciusko, Misisipi      La artista Mickalene Thomas hizo un doble retrato de Oprah Winfrey y Condoleeza Rice para enfatizar cómo ambas afroamericanas han superado obstáculos a lo largo de sus vidas.

121246,"Born Birmingham, Alabama     Condoleezza Rice began her political career as National Security Advisor in 2001 for George W. Bush’s first administration. When Bush was reelected, Rice was appointed the secretary of state, the first African American woman in the position. With a doctorate in political science, specializing in Russia, Rice was an integral voice in Washington and abroad on global geopolitics. Artist Mickalene Thomas created this work as a pendant to her Oprah Winfrey portrait—a powerful pairing of two accomplished African American women. Thomas depicts Rice as a focused, determined thinker, the subtle, hard gleam of the rhinestones suggesting the intensity of her sitter. After her distinguished career in the government, Rice has returned to Stanford University—she was previously a professor and then provost there—to teach political science and serve as a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. She remains vocal in the Republican Party, endorsing political candidates and commenting on matters of national security.

121303,"Born Charles County, Maryland  A key part of the antislavery movement was that African Americans began to speak for themselves, providing direct testimony about life under slavery. With his wife and four children, Josiah Henson was able to escape from bondage in 1830, settling in Canada. He became a minister, was active in the Underground Railroad, and published a memoir, The Life of Josiah Henson, Formerly a Slave, Narrated by Himself (1849). Harriet Beecher Stowe drew on the memoir for Uncle Tom’s Cabin, and her saintly character Uncle Tom may have been modeled on Henson; during a tour of England, where this portrait was taken, Henson was called “Uncle Tom” by the newspapers."
121304,"Born Oldham County, Kentucky   The son of a Kentucky slave-owner, D. W. Griffith is best remembered for Birth of a Nation (1915), which depicted the Reconstruction-era South as terrorized by carpetbaggers and freed slaves, with the Ku Klux Klan as the savior of womanhood. Griffith used quotes from Woodrow Wilson’s 1903 History of the American People to support his story. Wilson screened the film at the White House—the first time a full-length movie was thus honored. Notwithstanding protests led by a nascent NAACP and bans in several cities because of fears about white on black riots and lynchings, Birth of a Nation was immensely popular, reflecting the dismal state of race relations in America. To this day it is praised for its technical virtuosity and epic quality, along with its intensely personal stories of individuals caught up in historic events. Griffith enhanced many of the era’s new film techniques and integrated them within powerful spectacle and narrative, making him one of the pioneers of modern film. "
121305,"Born Long Beach, New Jersey  In the early 1970s, Bruce Springsteen honed his musical chops in north Jersey bars and roadhouses, writing songs and creating a sound that became the anthem for disaffected suburban and working-class Americans. Springsteen’s populism, in songs like “Born to Run” and “10th Avenue Freezeout,” caught the romanticism of rock and roll but also a deep vein of populism in the dignity and respect his music paid to the lives and aspirations of ordinary Americans. Initially dismissed as derivative of Bob Dylan or Van Morrison, Springsteen created music that merged lyrical introspection with a powerhouse sound that made his concerts an ecstatic experience. Simultaneously, Time and Newsweek covers in 1975 vaulted “The Boss” and his E Street Band to national attention. Springsteen continues to be a powerful presence both in the American songbook and as a performer.   This Annie Leibovitz photograph was used as a poster for Springsteen’s “Born in the U.S.A” concert tour in 1984."
121307,"Get out the vote effort in Baltimore, Maryland, October 31, 1964  In the weeks leading up to the 1964 presidential election, King crisscrossed the country urging African Americans to exercise the voting rights guaranteed to them by the Civil Rights Act and to go to the polls in large numbers. Although King stopped short of formally endorsing Lyndon Johnson’s candidacy, he argued that a victory by Republican challenger Barry Goldwater—who had voted against the civil rights legislation—would pose ""a threat to freedom."" Besides spotlighting the presidential contest, King spoke out on local ballot initiatives affecting civil rights. When discussing the impact of his recently announced Nobel Prize, King told a Baltimore audience, ""It helps . . . to know that the tide of world opinion is on our side."" Afterward, as he rode through the city in an open-air motorcade, exuberant bystanders surged toward his car, eager to greet him and reach for his hand."
121311,"Born New York City  Called “the matriarch in modern cancer genetics,” Dr. Janet Rowley was only one of six women in her graduating class at the University of Chicago medical school in 1948—an institution to which she returned as a full professor nearly thirty years later. After examining DNA replication of chromosomes throughout the 1960s—a period when the field was still developing—she observed that acute myeloid leukemia patients shared two specific chromosomes that had broken off and exchanged ends, what is now known as blood cancer chromosomal translocation. In recognition of this landmark discovery, Rowley was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1999, followed by the Presidential Medal of Freedom.  For her portrait, Rowley commissioned Jon Friedman, who made this oil sketch during an initial sitting. Rather than showcasing her scientific acumen during these sessions, Rowley presented herself informally—just after a morning swim."
121312,"Born New York City     Maxine Singer’s achievements in science are newsworthy, but she has eluded the public eye. A pioneering molecular biologist, Singer has also been in the forefront of crafting ethical and safety guidelines for genetic engineering and is a staunch public advocate for science. She began her career at the National Institute of Arthritis, Metabolism, and Digestive Diseases in 1958 and moved to the National Cancer Institute in 1974, where she was recognized for her research in recombinant DNA. She led the Carnegie Institution from 1988 to 2002, earning the National Medal of Science in 1992. Singer is renowned not only for her research but also for promoting science education in public schools and equal access for women and minorities in scientific fields.  Commissioned by the Carnegie Institution to make a painted portrait of Singer, artist Jon Friedman worked closely with her during the photo shoot. Capturing in this sketch the immediacy of a moment, he implies the impact of her intense focus.      Maxine Singer  nacida en 1931  Nacida en la ciudad de Nueva York     Los logros de Maxine Singer en las ciencias son dignos de primeras planas, pero ella esquiva la atención del público. Singer no solo ha sido pionera de la biología molecular, sino una líder en la elaboración de pautas éticas y de seguridad para el ámbito de la ingeniería genética, además de tenaz defensora pública de las ciencias. Comenzó su carrera en 1958 en el Instituto Nacional de Artritis, Metabolismo y Enfermedades Digestivas y se trasladó en 1974 al Instituto Nacional del Cáncer, donde fue reconocida por su investigación sobre el ADN recombinante. Dirigió el Instituto Carnegie desde 1988 hasta 2002, y recibió la Medalla Nacional de las Ciencias en 1992. Singer es famosa no solo por sus investigaciones sino por promover la enseñanza de ciencias en las escuelas públicas y el acceso equitativo para las mujeres y las minorías en los campos científicos.  El Instituto Carnegie le comisionó a Jon Friedman un retrato pintado de Singer y él trabajó de cerca con ella durante la sesión de fotos. Al captar en este boceto la inmediatez de un momento, el artista evoca la impactante intensidad de esta mujer.      Jon R.

121316,"Born London, England  In recalling her father’s warning that a writing life was not a secure one, Jhumpa Lahiri wrote, “I listen to him, and at the same time I have learned not to listen, to wander to the edge of the precipice and leap.” Her first book, Interpreter of Maladies, won the Pulitzer Prize in 2000. As a child growing up in Rhode Island, Lahiri remembers the important role that books and stories played in her visual and psychic landscape. Her father, a librarian and later a professor, filled the house with books. Her grandfather’s vibrant storytelling on her first visit to India contributed to a passion for reading. Later, novels became a way of “trespassing” on the American culture that was foreign to her immigrant parents.   Artist Raymond Elman chose to portray Lahiri in by the sea in Cape Cod, a setting that he describes as “universal.”"
121319,"“Hammering” Hank Aaron is one of the greatest baseball players in major league history. He was scouted at sixteen and played in the Negro leagues before signing with the Milwaukee (later Atlanta) Braves, for whom he debuted in 1954. A perennial All-Star and the league MVP in 1957, Aaron was remarkably consistent: in a twenty-three-year major-league career he never hit more than fifty homers in a season but always ranked near the top of the hitting statistics. A compact six-footer, Aaron generated tremendous bat speed with his extraordinary reflexes. In 1974 he broke Babe Ruth’s record of 714 career home runs; Aaron’s chase of Ruth’s record was widely celebrated as a sign of racial progress in the New South. Elected to the Hall of Fame in 1982, Aaron has had an estimable post-baseball career doing charitable and civic work in Atlanta and Milwaukee.  Hank Aaron, apodado “el Martillo”, es uno de los jugadores más importantes en la historia de las grandes ligas de béisbol. Fue reclutado a los dieciséis años y jugó en las ligas afroamericanas antes de firmar contrato con los Bravos de Milwaukee (luego de Atlanta), equipo con el cual debutó en 1954. Perenne Jugador Estrella y nombrado Jugador Más Valioso de la liga en 1957, Aaron fue notablemente constante: en su carrera de veintitrés años en las grandes ligas, nunca bateó más de cincuenta jonrones en una temporada, pero siempre ocupó las posiciones más altas en las estadísticas de bateo. De constitución compacta y seis pies de estatura, Aaron generaba una velocidad de bateo tremenda con sus reflejos extraordinarios. En 1974, rompió el récord de Babe Ruth de 714 jonrones en su carrera; el desafío al récord de Babe Ruth fue muy celebrado como signo del progreso racial en el “nuevo sur” de EE.UU. Instalado en el Salón de la Fama en 1982, luego de dejar el béisbol, Aaron se ha dedicado a una admirable carrera de obras caritativas y cívicas en Atlanta y Milwaukee."
121328,"Anita O’Day was a jazz singer whose streetwise style shifted the idea of the ""girl singer"" to the postwar ""hip chick."" Raised during the Great Depression and toughened by poverty, O’Day broke into show business by winning walk-a-thons and dance contests. The star vocalist of Gene Krupa’s band, O’Day rebelled against gender norms: she created a professional look for women (a black sports jacket and short skirt) and broke the color line by singing with the trumpeter Roy Eldridge. ""Anita . . . says what she thinks, wears what she pleases, and behaves as she prefers to behave,"" one reporter noted in 1946. Like many of her male counterparts in jazz, she also became a heroin addict. Despite two short prison stints for marijuana and heroin possession, O’Day released several excellent albums in the 1950s and stole the show at the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival with her slow, iconic version of ""Sweet Georgia Brown."" In 1981 she published High Times, Hard Times, a brutally honest memoir of jazz and addiction."

121341,"This engraving of a crucial event in the War of 1812 pictures not one hero but two: the USS Constitution—nicknamed “Old Ironsides” because of her strength in deflecting the cannonballs of the British—and the ship’s commander, Isaac Hull (1773–1843), in the pendant portrait below. First commissioned as a naval lieutenant in 1798, Hull was an experienced officer by the start of the war. Spotting the British frigate Guerrière in the North Atlantic on August 19, 1812, Hull maneuvered his ship alongside it and ordered every starboard gun to fire. His agile and fearless leadership paid off: the Guerrière was destroyed. It was the first American victory over a British frigate and the first good news of the war.   Hull’s portrait—along with a detailed narration of the battle and the majestic depiction of the Constitution—memorializes the significance of the navy in America’s “second” war for independence."
121352,"   Born Odessa, Russia  Art dealer Bella Fishko founded the Forum Gallery in New York City in 1961, which she managed until 1988 when she retired, succeeded by her son. The gallery, long a mainstay of the art world, was known for its representation of leading figurative artists even during an era when portraiture and figuration was considered by some critics to be out of fashion for progressive artists. Fishko gave Gregory Gillespie, the artist of this image, his first solo exhibition at the Forum Gallery. Gillespie surrounds the slightly frightening likeness with his own diminutive portrait and some of his own paintings. As one critic noted, Gillespie ""is not simply a Surrealist, a Hyperrealist, or a Photorealist; rather, he is himself an assemblage, taking elements from everywhere and transforming them in his deeply personal way."""
121380,"Born Fullersburg, Illinois  In the 1890s, Loie Fuller’s genius was to create an electrifying style of dance that harnessed technology with the emerging physical culture movement. She became famous for her Serpentine Dance, an undulating performance enacted amid dazzling visual staging.   For this dance, Fuller clothed herself in a voluminous, transparent costume consisting of 500 yards of thin China silk and bathed herself in multicolored stage lighting of her own design. Critics reported that the dance regularly swept audiences “into an emotional frenzy” that required twenty or more encores.  Touring made her internationally famous, and consumers everywhere lined up to buy Loie Fuller hats, shoes, and petticoats. She became a star of the Folies Bergère, and her Fire Dance sparked a sensation at the Paris Exposition Universelle in 1900.  A modern dance pioneer, Loie Fuller paved the way for such other women dancers as Isadora Duncan."
121387,"The jazz drummer and bandleader Gene Krupa once remarked about his career: ""I succeeded in doing two things. I made the drummer a high-priced guy and I was able to project enough so that people were drawn to jazz."" A pioneering virtuoso whose long and exuberant solos became his signature, he transformed the drummer from a band’s timekeeper to a featured performer. He studied for the priesthood but dropped out to pursue a career in music and joined Benny Goodman’s new big band in 1934. Krupa’s exuberant showmanship and tousled, boyish persona made him a wartime matinee idol, and he broke with Goodman. The Gene Krupa Band had many hits in the 1940s and jump-started the careers of the singer Anita O’Day and the trumpeter Roy Eldridge. Lionized in the movie The Gene Krupa Story (1959), he also started a national chain of drum schools."
121389,"Despite his slight stature, the martial arts expert Bruce Lee became legendary for his fluid style and skill, and especially his one-inch punch. Having established his own martial arts school in 1963, Lee encouraged his students (including Steve McQueen) to master psychological control alongside physical discipline, exemplifying a belief that philosophical understanding cultivated an internal strength and calm that worked hand in hand with physical skill. This style, called Jeet Kune Do, led to a tough but relaxed, even understated presentation that played well on television and film as a version of ""grace under pressure."" After making several martial arts movies in Hong Kong, Lee starred in the first Hollywood–Hong Kong coproduction, The Big Boss (1971). His films popularized martial arts, especially among African American youths, who related to a nonwhite hero who fought established powers while remaining calm and in control. Tupac Shakur and other hip-hop artists have been fans of Lee, and ""kung fu"" references remain prevalent in rap and throughout popular culture."
121390,"Marvin Gaye brought political consciousness and sexual healing to the Motown sound as a soul singer and songwriter. Raised by an abusive father, Gaye first found his voice in gospel and doo-wop groups. While working as a session drummer for Motown, he crafted a vocal style indebted to Frank Sinatra and the black church but with a three-octave range. Whether swinging a raspy gospel tenor or a lover-man falsetto, Gaye expressed both sweetness and grit in the same note. After a series of hit duets for Motown, he rebelled against the label’s apolitical stance and released What’s Going On (1971)—an album of dense Afro-Latin rhythms, black pride and protest, and ambient sounds. In his last decade, he alternated albums of social protest with song cycles of sex and seduction while coping with substance abuse and personal troubles. Rolling Stone ranks Marvin Gaye as number six on its list of greatest singers and number eighteen on its list of greatest artists."
121391,"Nearly two decades after his death, Tupac Shakur remains one of the most magnetic and best-selling rappers in music. A figure of great strength and vulnerability, Shakur wrote songs that probed the difficult circumstances experienced by many inner-city black youths. Repeatedly condemned for his explicit, violent, and at times misogynistic lyrics, he reveled in his outlaw status and became a part of the ""thug life"" that his music portrayed. Shakur’s eight-month incarceration for a sexual assault in 1993 coincided with his emergence as a crossover success. Though he glorified being a ""playa"" in baggy jeans, he was critical of hip-hop’s excesses and wrote poignantly about political and social injustice. Shakur was killed in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996 at the age of twenty-five. Like that of his contemporary Kurt Cobain, his life seemed like a constant struggle between his art, his cultural politics, and the demands of fame."

Raised in Vermont and Southern California, White has won two Olympic gold medals in the snowboard half-pipe in successive winter games (2006, 2010). He has also been a multiple medalist in other national and international boarding competitions. Having overcome a heart defect as an infant, White started skateboarding at an early age and was discovered by the modern pioneer of the sport, Tony Hawk. White is clearly Hawk’s successor as the face of alternative games, not only because of his skill on the boards but also for his infectious, effervescent personality.    Shaun White  nacido en 1986  Nacido en San Diego, California     Shaun White, alias “El Tomate Volador” (por su largo cabello rojo, que ahora se ha cortado), es un atleta de deportes extremos que se especializa en patineta y tabla de nieve (snowboarding). White, criado entre Vermont y el sur de California, ha ganado dos medallas de oro consecutivas en las Olimpiadas de Invierno (2006, 2010) en pista de medio tubo. También ha sido múltiple medallista en otras competencias nacionales e internacionales. Habiendo superado una afección cardiaca en su infancia, White empezó a practicar el snowboarding desde temprano y fue descubierto por el pionero moderno de ese deporte, Tony Hawk.

A three-time MVP and nine-time All-Star, Pujols already has more than 500 home runs while also hitting for a career average of .317. Pujols, a big man, is the prototype for the power-hitting first baseman/designated hitter. After the 2011 season, and despite his success with the Cardinals, Pujols chose to sign with the Angels for ten years and $254 million dollars—a deal that was widely criticized for being too much for a slugger in the second half of his career. In sports, the numbers count: performance in the arena defines them.    Albert Pujols  nacido en 1980  Nacido en Santo Domingo, República Dominicana     Primero con los Cardenales de St. Louis (2001–11), con quienes ganó dos títulos de la Serie Mundial, y luego con los Angelinos de Los Ángeles (2012–presente), Albert Pujols ha probado ser uno de los más temidos bateadores en el mundo del béisbol. Premiado tres veces como jugador más valioso y elegido nueve veces para el Juego de Estrellas de las Grandes Ligas, Pujols ya tiene en su haber más de 500 jonrones con un promedio de bateo de .317. Es un hombre corpulento, prototipo de la potencia que se espera de un primera base o un bateador designado. Al final de la temporada 2011, y a pesar de su éxito con los Cardenales, Pujols decidió firmar un contrato de diez años con los Angelinos por $254 millones, acuerdo que fue muy criticado por considerarse demasiado cuantioso para un bateador ya en la segunda mitad de su carrera.

James was seemingly set in Miami; he had promised the team on his arrival in 2010, “not one, not two, not three, not four. . .” titles. Leaving Miami broke up the so-called “dream team” of James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh, but it helped restore James’s image, which had been tarnished by the televised orchestration of his decision to “take his talents to South Beach” in 2010. When Vogue pictured him on a 2008 cover as King Kong holding model Gisele Bündchen, the image raised troubling questions of racial insensitivity. James is the dominant ballplayer of his time and capable of breathtaking feats on the hardwood. He is a four-time league MVP and a two-time MVP in the NBA finals.

As the older sibling, Venus had the weight of being first, not least in asserting the way that the sisters play: powerful and with an all-out athleticism that is ferocious to watch. Although the sisters are uncomfortable playing each other, theirs is one of the transcendent rivalries of sports. The Williams sisters have monopolized the major trophies in recent tennis history; Venus trails only Serena in titles won on the women’s tour. Venus has won nine Grand Slam tournaments, an Olympic Gold Medal (2000), and numerous doubles titles playing with her sister.

He has won three NBA championships, one as the star of the Heat team by himself in 2006—he was named finals MVP—and two with his former teammate LeBron James. A shooting guard, Wade has the ability to be a high-volume scorer—he led the league in 2008–9—and he is also an adept at adjusting his playing to those around him. After being the focal point of his 2006 team, he adapted to the subordinate role of becoming Robin to James’s Batman. Wade always looks like he’s working hard on the court, a contrast to the athleticism of James. Wade is a ten-time All-Star, and he also won a gold medal in the Beijing Olympic games (2008).

At the Beijing Olympics (2008) he took home a staggering eight gold medals. His career total is eighteen gold medals, double the number of the next-highest winner. Although past his peak, Phelps still won four golds and two silvers in the 2012 London games, and he is aiming for a place in the pool in the 2016 games in Brazil. Phelps, even more than most athletes because he is nearly invisible in the water, is present to us in his record-breaking domination of the pool but remains a mysterious, elusive persona.

121421,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania     Kobe Bryant’s father was the well-traveled basketball player Joe “Jellybean” Bryant. Kobe, who was named after the expensive Japanese steak, spent some of his youth in Europe, where his father played professionally. Drafted out of high school in Philadelphia, Bryant has spent his entire career with the Los Angeles Lakers. He was the next NBA superstar after Michael Jordan: a five-time NBA champion; the league MVP in 2008; and a sixteen-time All-Star—he once scored eighty-one points in a game. Bryant, not unlike Jordan, can be a difficult teammate. Extremely emotive, Bryant dominates the court not just with his play but also with a ferocious scowl that he directs toward teammates, opponents, and the audience.

Kobe Bryant  nacido en 1978  Nacido en Filadelfia, Pensilvania     El padre de Kobe Bryant es el baloncelista y gran viajero Joe “Jellybean” Bryant. Kobe, quien comparte su nombre con una costosa carne japonesa, pasó parte de su juventud en Europa, donde su padre jugaba profesionalmente. El joven Bryant fue reclutado como profesional al terminar la escuela superior en Filadelfia, y ha permanecido con los Lakers de Los Ángeles toda su carrera. Fue la gran estrella de la NBA después de Michael Jordan: cinco veces campeón de la NBA, jugador más valioso de la liga en 2008 y All Star dieciséis veces (una vez anotó ochenta y un puntos en un juego). Igual que Jordan, Bryant puede ser difícil como compañero de equipo. Es demasiado emotivo y domina la cancha no solo con su juego sino con un gesto feroz que dirige lo mismo a sus compañeros que a los adversarios y al público. A Bryant se le acusó de agresión sexual en Colorado (2003–4); la demanda fue retirada más tarde y se alcanzó un acuerdo fuera del tribunal con la demandante.

121422,"Born Saginaw, Michigan     Serena Williams and her older sister, Venus, were trained on the public tennis courts of Compton, California, by their father to become tennis champions. Both sisters have more than fulfilled his expectations, becoming two of the greatest players of all time as well as stamping an African American presence on the sport. As of October 2015, Serena Williams is the number-one ranked woman player in the world. She has won twenty-one Grand Slam singles titles, including six Wimbledon Championships and the 2014 U.S. Open. Serena has a serve that is rivaled in the women’s game only by her sister’s, and both rely on their power and court coverage to aggressively pressure their opponents. The Williams sisters’ powerful, fierce personas, coupled with their dominant abilities, allow them an extra level of psychological advantage over their opponents.     Serena Williams  nacida en 1981  Nacida en Saginaw, Míchigan     Serena Williams y su hermana mayor, Venus, aprendieron a jugar tenis con su padre en las canchas públicas de Compton, California, aspirando a convertirse en campeonas. Las expectativas se han cumplido con creces, pues ambas están entre las mejores tenistas de todos los tiempos y han hecho sentir la presencia afroamericana en ese deporte. A enero de 2015, Serena Williams está clasificada como jugadora número uno en el mundo. Ha ganado diecinueve títulos individuales del Grand Slam, incluidos cinco en los torneos de Wimbledon y el U.S. Open 2014. Su saque no tiene rival en el ámbito femenino, a excepción del de su hermana, y ambas explotan su fuerza y alcance en la cancha para ejercer una presión contundente sobre sus adversarias. Las Williams cultivan una imagen poderosa y fiera que, unida a sus capacidades superiores, les da una ventaja psicológica sobre sus oponentes.

121446,"Born Carlsbad, California     As a performer and entrepreneur, Tony Hawk is the single most important figure in the modern history of skateboarding and the X Games. The development of sticky, adhesive skateboard wheels allowed athletes to do many more tricks and maneuvers with the board than had been possible with the first, hard compound wheels in the 1960s. Skateboarding appealed particularly to boys who took an edgy stance against mainstream team sports. Hawk gravitated to it because he needed to burn off energy as a hyperactive child. He quickly became adept, turning professional at age fourteen; he won the national skateboarding world championship twelve years straight and was the first competitor to complete a number of tricks, including two-and-a-half revolutions in midair (a “900”). A lanky, amiable presence with floppy hair and an oversize helmet, Hawk is transformed as he launches himself and his board into the air. He retired in 1999 but continues to do exhibitions, appear on TV and in movies, and market his line of equipment and clothing for X Gamers.    Tony Hawk  nacido en 1968  Nacido en Carlsbad, California     Como atleta y como empresario, Tony Hawk es sin duda la figura más importante en la historia moderna de la patineta y los deportes extremos. El invento de ruedas de superficie adhesiva para las patinetas permitió a los atletas realizar muchos más trucos y piruetas que con las ruedas duras fabricadas en los años sesenta. La patineta atraía sobre todo a los chicos que querían desafiar los deportes tradicionales de equipo. Hawk se acercó a ella porque era un niño hiperactivo y necesitaba quemar energía. Pronto se hizo experto, y a los catorce años ya era profesional. Ganó las competencias mundiales de la National Skateboard Association durante doce años consecutivos y fue el primero en realizar con éxito varias piruetas, entre ellas la llamada “900” (dos vueltas y media en el aire). Desgarbado y afable, con su cabellera lacia y un casco demasiado grande, Hawk se transforma cuando se lanza al aire con su patineta. En 1999 se retiró, pero sigue participando en eventos de exhibición, programas de televisión y películas, además de mercadear su línea de equipo y ropa para deportes extremos.

121447,"Born Vallejo, California     One of the dominant drivers on the NASCAR circuit, four-time Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon is part of the new breed of drivers who broke into stock car racing in the 1990s. Personable, media-savvy, and a Californian, Gordon is at odds with the sport’s “good-old-boy” roots in the South; his persona as a quiet, humble “boy next door” is at odds with the rough-and-tumble personalities prized by racing’s fans. He especially drew the ire of Dale Earnhardt’s supporters, who regarded him as inauthentic and “middle class.” But Gordon’s skill on the track is undeniable, winning him respect, if not affection. He has more than ninety victories on the NASCAR circuit, racing the powerful Hendrick Motorsports team’s number twenty-four car. He is a strong contender for a fifth title as the 2014 NASCAR season concludes    Jeff Gordon  nacido en 1971  Nacido en Vallejo, California     Una de las más destacadas figuras en el circuito de la NASCAR y cuatro veces ganador de la Copa Winston, Jeff Gordon pertenece a la nueva cosecha de conductores que irrumpieron en la escena de las carreras de stock cars en la década de 1990. Afable, conocedor de los medios y californiano, Gordon no concuerda con las raíces típicamente sureñas de este deporte; su imagen de chico normal, callado y humilde no va con las personalidades alborotosas y más agresivas que los fanáticos de las carreras adoran. En particular, enfureció a los seguidores de Dale Earnhardt, que lo consideraban poco auténtico y “burgués”. Pero el talento de Gordon en la pista es innegable y le ha ganado respecto, si no afecto. Tiene en su haber más de noventa victorias en el circuito NASCAR al timón del auto número veinticuatro del poderoso equipo Hendrick Motorsports.

121607,"The actor and comedian Bill Murray　seemed to arrive fully formed on Saturday Night Live in the 1970s—a confident rebel oddball born of Catholic school, a huge Chicago family, and the 1960s that added up to an alternative blueprint for American manhood. On film, it was as if he was bioengineered to tweak and threaten American institutions: summer camp, country clubs, the army. His persona had few precedents beyond, perhaps, Bugs Bunny—another creature with few natural advantages who survived on sheer wit and self-possession. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Murray turned inward in Zen-tinged ""self-improvement"" comedies like　Scrooged (1988) and Groundhog Day　(1993). He was introduced to a third generation as the melancholy muse for young filmmakers, including Wes Anderson, Sofia Coppola, and Jim Jarmusch. His latest, strangest transformation remains in effect: he is a kind of perpetual wandering performance artist, popping up at birthday parties, kickball games, golf tournaments, and karaoke booths and in zombie films, wherever the wind and his fancy take him."
121681,"Born Hoboken, New Jersey  Singer-actor Frank Sinatra, one of the most dominant American entertainers of the twentieth century, was a teen idol crooner in his twenties and a critical success in his thirties. After launching an Oscar-winning film career, reviving his reputation as a singer after a slump, and gaining “rat pack” celebrity, he was, by age fifty, a cultural icon. Ed Sorel’s drawing of Sinatra, depicting the singer at a peak moment of popularity and influence, appeared on the cover of the April 1966 issue of Esquire magazine. It accompanied Gay Talese’s article, “Frank Sinatra Has a Cold,” a celebrated example of “New Journalism” that described the extensive entourage that enabled his recordings and his concert, nightclub, radio, television, and film appearances. “A Sinatra with a cold,” Talese argued, “can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond.”"
121719,"Born Rapallo, Italy  Italian confectioner Domingo Ghirardelli established himself as a chocolate merchant in Lima, Peru, before immigrating to California in 1849, during the early days of the gold rush. He tried his hand at mining but quickly realized that selling provisions to those working the gold fields would be far more lucrative. The overwhelming success of his first general store in Stockton, California, prompted Ghirardelli to open a second location in San Francisco. Fires destroyed both establishments in 1851, but the resilient businessman quickly rebuilt. In 1852 he launched the manufacturing and retail enterprise that would become the Ghirardelli Chocolate Company. One of only two chocolate manufacturers in the United States before the Civil War, Ghirardelli dominated the western market. In 1867 his company revolutionized the industry by introducing the world’s first nonperishable ground chocolate for beverages and baking. By 1885 Ghirardelli was importing more than 450,000 pounds of cocoa beans per year. "
121720,"Born Lima, Peru  At the time of her 1847 marriage to Domingo Ghirardelli in Lima, Peru, Carmen Alvarado Martin was a young widow with an infant daughter. When Domingo sailed to California to seek his fortune in 1849, Carmen initially remained behind. But in 1853, accompanied by her daughter and the couple’s two children, Carmen joined her husband in San Francisco. The family first made its home above Ghirardelli’s confectionary on Portsmouth Square and later resided above the business’s new location on Jackson Street. In 1859 Domingo built a substantial residence in the East Bay community of Oakland, where the Ghirardelli family grew to include eight children. Although Carmen spoke no English, she settled happily in a diverse community where Spanish speakers were plentiful.  Both Carmen Ghirardelli’s photograph and that of her husband were enhanced in the studio with ink and watercolor to heighten their visual impact. "
121765,"Fayard Nicholas 1914–2006  Born Mobile, Alabama  Harold Nicholas 1921–2000  Born Winston-Salem, North Carolina  The Nicholas Brothers have been called the greatest tap dancers of all time. They created a sensation at the Cotton Club when Harold was eleven and Fayard eighteen. In 1936 they debuted on Broadway in the Ziegfeld Follies, directed by Vincente Minnelli and choreographed by George Balanchine. The next year Balanchine worked with them in the Rodgers and Hart hit musical Babes in Arms.  Their movies—including Kid Millions, The Big Broadcast, Down Argentine Way (shown in this photograph), Stormy Weather, and The Pirate—record their electrifying dance style. Sometimes called “flash-act acrobatic dancing,” their tap was a dazzling hybrid that fused African American vernacular dance with ballet, and jazz dance with improvised acrobatics. Fayard Nicholas explained, “My brother and I used our whole bodies, our hands, our personalities. We tried to make it classic.”"
121766,"Born Lancaster, Pennsylvania  An 1841 graduate of West Point, John F. Reynolds earned battlefield promotions during the Mexican American War for his bravery at Monterrey and Buena Vista. He subsequently saw duty at garrisons throughout the nation and twice commanded overland expeditions to Salt Lake City, including a campaign against the Mormons in 1858. During the Civil War, Reynolds distinguished himself as a corps commander in the Army of the Potomac. Captured in June 1862 and held at Libby Prison in Richmond, he was later released in a prisoner exchange. On July 1, 1863, while leading his troops into action at Gettysburg, Reynolds was felled by Confederate fire."
121776,"Conclusion of the march from Selma to Montgomery, March 25, 1965  (left to right): Ralph Abernathy, James Forman, Martin Luther King Jr., Jesse L. Douglas, John Lewis  King launched a major initiative in January 1965 to register black voters in Selma, Alabama, and later called for a fifty-mile protest march from Selma to Montgomery. He was conducting Sunday services in Atlanta on March 7 as marchers crossed Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge and were confronted by state troopers and local lawmen. When the protesters did not retreat, they were tear-gassed and savagely attacked. Returning immediately to Selma, King led a second march to the bridge on March 9 but turned back rather than violate a federal restraining order. After a federal judge issued a decision permitting the march to proceed, King and other civil rights leaders led the triumphant Selma-to-Montgomery march that reached Alabama’s capital on March 25. The events of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Selma galvanized support for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which passed both Houses of Congress and was signed into law by President Johnson on August 6, 1965."
121786,"Born Memphis, Tennessee  Handsome, lanky, and blessed with an immediately recognizable voice, Morgan Freeman is one of the most distinguished contemporary actors of both stage and screen. He won early plaudits in the plays Coriolanus (1980) and Driving Miss Daisy; he reprised his role in the latter in the 1989 movie adaptation. Freeman’s transition to film was seamless—he has also worked in television—and he was nominated several times for an Academy Award before winning an Oscar for his role in Million Dollar Baby (2004). Freeman works almost constantly, and among his more notable roles are as an African American soldier in the Civil War drama Glory (1989) and as the convict “Red” in the cult classic The Shawshank Redemption (1994), in which he also provides the narration. Freeman’s great pipes have made him a sought-after narrator of cartoons and documentaries. In 2007 he achieved a longtime dream by making a bio-pic about Nelson Mandela."
121787,"Born New York City  Most stories about the Armory Show play down Walter Pach’s significant role, focusing mainly on his involvement as an agent for the European artists in the exhibition. As an art critic, historian, lecturer, agent, and champion of modernism, Pach was a driving force behind the pivotal 1913 show, along with Walt Kuhn and Arthur B. Davies. Pach’s presence in the transatlantic contemporary art world—with one foot in the United States and the other in Paris between 1903 and 1913—shaped the arc of the show. During this time, he befriended influential artists and thinkers, including the French cubist painter and printmaker Jacques Villon, who was the younger brother of Marcel Duchamp. In his sensitive ink-and-pencil sketch, Villon captures an introspective man who considered himself primarily an artist. The drawing is a study for Villon’s oil portrait of Pach, now in the collection of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. "
121790,"At the start of the Revolutionary War, almost any fictitious image could pass as a portrait of an American hero. But George Washington (1732–1799), as commander-in-chief, warranted extra efforts. Engraver John Norman, producing a utilitarian broadside almanac, featured an authentic likeness of the general, elaborately framed by patriotic and military symbols. He based his portrait on the work of Charles Willson Peale, who had made paintings, prints, and miniatures of Washington from life. Surrounding the portrait are swags, palm branches, cannons, banners, and the seal of Pennsylvania, along with twin allegorical figures of fame blowing their trumpets and a well-recognized symbol of colonial resistance, the rattlesnake. This rare almanac actually played an important role in disseminating Washington’s likeness. The Peale-derived head, often accompanied by these military banners and cannons, was copied repeatedly for inexpensive almanacs and children’s primers throughout the two terms of Washington’s presidency.

In Yellow Deb, Red Deb, Silver Deb, and Blue Deb, she models her self-portrait on Warhol’s screenprints of celebrities surrounded by resplendently colored backgrounds. While in some respects the self-portraits closely imitate Warhol’s 1964 print of Elizabeth Taylor, Kass’s subtle shifts change the meaning to reflect her own themes: her gender, Jewishness, and sexuality.

121933,"Michael Jackson (1958–2009) was only eleven years old in January 1970 when “I Want You Back”—the Jackson 5’s first Motown Records single—reached number one on both the pop and R&B charts. The junior member of the ensemble consisting of his brothers Tito (born 1953), Marlon (born 1957), Jackie (born 1951), and Jermaine Jackson (born 1954), Michael quickly emerged as the group’s lead performer with incandescent vocals and dance moves that were extraordinary for one so young. Fueled by Michael’s talent, the Jackson 5 scored a string of hits with their next three singles—“ABC,” “The Love You Save,” and “I’ll Be There”—which topped the charts in rapid succession. After releasing his first solo recording “Got to Be There” in 1971, Michael continued to perform with the Jackson 5 for several more years before leaving the group to pursue a phenomenally successful career as a singer, songwriter, and performer."

A joint initiative of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) and Al Raby’s Chicago-based Coordinating Council of Community Organizations (CCCO), the ""Chicago Plan"" called for a multiphased grassroots effort ""to bring about the unconditional surrender of forces dedicated to the creation and maintenance of slums."" At the end of January, King moved into a squalid Chicago tenement that served as his home during what proved to be a difficult and largely unsuccessful campaign. Efforts aimed at ghetto housing reform were thwarted by Mayor Richard Daley, who claimed his city was already addressing the problem. That summer, when King led marches through white suburban neighborhoods to press for fair housing, those demonstrations met with fierce and often violent opposition."
121959,"Born Hanley, Staffordshire, England  Al Hirschfeld’s vibrant portrait depicts Goddard Lieberson, a pianist and composer who served as president of Columbia Records for nearly two decades. Earlier in his career, Lieberson shepherded Columbia’s introduction of long-playing recordings (LPs), which transformed the public consumption of music. Championing such contemporary composers as Arnold Schoenberg, Igor Stravinsky, and Charles Ives, he worked with major orchestras and conductors to build Columbia’s classical repertoire. One of Lieberson’s greatest legacies was the Broadway cast recording. Cast albums of such shows as My Fair Lady (1956) and West Side Story (1957) sold millions of copies.  Hirschfeld’s caricatures, playwright Arthur Miller once noted, “make you feel that he has found a wit in your miserable features that may yet lend you a style and a dash you were never aware of in yourself.” The artist, who knew Lieberson well and drew record covers for Columbia, evokes the revolving vinyl in the portrait’s spiraling eyes."

Webb showed an early talent for drumming despite being constrained from infancy by a deformed spine that hunched his back and restricted his growth. (His adult height barely exceeded four feet.) He acquired his first drum set by the age of twelve and progressed rapidly from street musician to dance band drummer. In 1926, after settling in Harlem, Webb launched his career as a bandleader. Within a year he and his orchestra were performing at the Savoy Ballroom, where they would vanquish formidable rivals such as Benny Goodman in the Savoy’s storied battles of the bands.

As a young man he played in a combo with Ray Charles and toured internationally with Dizzy Gillespie. In 1964 he became the first African American executive at a white-owned record company and also created his first score for a major Hollywood film, The Pawnbroker. He has since composed for dozens of motion pictures, including In the Heat of the Night (1967) and The Color Purple (1985). His skill as a producer resulted in hit albums for musicians ranging from Frank Sinatra to Michael Jackson, with whom Jones collaborated on the mega-hit album Thriller (1982).  Known for his dynamic images of musicians, Chuck Stewart photographed Quincy Jones during a rehearsal in New York City where Jones was working as the arranger for the Broadway musical Free and Easy (1959)."
121997,"Born Tuskegee, Alabama  As a boycott of Montgomery, Alabama’s racially segregated buses entered its third month, Rosa Parks was arrested for the second time. One of 115 black Montgomerians—including Martin Luther King Jr.—to be indicted by the county grand jury on charges of violating a 1921 Alabama law prohibiting boycotts, Parks was taken into custody and jailed on February 22, 1956. Although the Montgomery Improvement Association quickly posted Parks’s bail, this wire service photo of the dignified seamstress being fingerprinted by Deputy Sheriff D. H. Lackey appeared the next day on the front page of the New York Times and ran in countless newspapers across the nation."
122026,"Born New York City  Marvin Hamlisch is credited with writing some of the most celebrated music in movie and stage history, including motion picture scores for The Way We Were (1974), The Sting (1974), The Spy Who Loved Me (1977), Ordinary People (1980), and Sophie’s Choice (1982). He was the winner of multiple Oscars and Grammy Awards, and his 1975 musical A Chorus Line earned both a Tony Award and a Pulitzer Prize. London portrait artist Richard Stone made studies of the composer from life in the year before Hamlisch’s death, with sittings in London, Los Angeles, and New York City. The artist recalls meetings filled with music and laughter. In the portrait, Hamlisch holds the music for his poignant “What I Did For Love” from A Chorus Line."
122175,"In the song ""Stay Away"" from Nirvana’s 1991 album Nevermind, the band’s front man, Kurt Cobain, sings, ""Monkey see, monkey do / . . . I’d rather be dead than cool."" Led by Cobain’s wailing voice and his explosive guitar chords, Nevermind was arguably the most influential album of its time, selling more than ten million copies during the band’s short life. Yet Cobain, like Bob Dylan, was a reluctant rock star who felt much ambivalence about the band’s success and great discomfort with the attention of fans and the media. A product of the Pacific Northwest punk scene, he wore thrift-store plaid shirts and torn jeans and sought to distance himself from the packaged stadium rockers of the previous decade. Louder, faster, and often darker, Seattle grunge, as exemplified by Nirvana, also proved widely popular. Three years after Nevermind’s release, at the age of twenty-seven, Cobain—addicted to heroin—killed himself with a shotgun."
122641,"Born East Lansing, Michigan     More than just a feat of software engineering, the Google search engine has been transformative for Internet users everywhere. Co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page met as doctoral students in computer science at Stanford University. After developing algorithms that could find information easily on the Web, they created Google in 1997. Currently, the company is expanding from its search engine roots into robots and wearable technology.  In this commissioned work, artist Luke DuBois wryly uses a search engine to create an innovative, born-digital portrait of the camera-shy engineers—a nod to how most of us find images today of celebrities, spotlight seekers, and the reticent alike. The upper screen shows clips of interviews with Brin and Page that were found using Google search. The lower screen contains the real-time search results of words that Brin and Page used during the interviews. Because the search results will constantly change in Google, so will the words displayed, making this a dynamic, generative work, and turning the sitters into their own technology—invisible yet ubiquitous.    Sergey Brin  nacido en 1973  Nacido en Moscú, Rusia  Larry Page  nacido en 1973  Nacido en East Lansing, Míchigan     Más que una proeza de ingeniería informática, el motor de búsqueda Google ha sido un recurso transformador para los usuarios del Internet en todo el mundo. Sus fundadores, Sergey Brin y Larry Page, se conocieron cuando estudiaban sus doctorados en ciencias informáticas en la Universidad de Stanford. Luego de desarrollar algoritmos para encontrar información fácilmente en la web, crearon Google en 1997. Al presente la compañía se ha diversificado hacia las áreas de robótica y tecnología para prendas de vestir.  En esta obra comisionada, el artista Luke DuBois utiliza, no sin ironía, un motor de búsqueda para crear un novedoso retrato originado digitalmente de ambos ingenieros, quienes sienten timidez ante la cámara. Se trata de una apropiada alusión a la manera en que la mayoría de nosotros buscamos hoy en día imágenes de celebridades y aspirantes a la fama, e incluso de aquellos que no desean la atención pública. La parte superior de la pantalla muestra clips de entrevistas con Brin y Page encontradas mediante búsqueda en Google. La parte inferior contiene los resultados de búsquedas en tiempo real de palabras que Brin y Page utilizan durante las entrevistas. Dado que los resultados de la búsqueda cambiarán constantemente en Google, las palabras mostradas también cambiarán, haciendo de este retrato una obra dinámica y generativa que convierte a sus sujetos en la tecnología que ellos mismos crearon: invisible y sin embargo ubicua.

122668,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania     In 2011, at age forty-six, Bernard Hopkins claimed the Ring’s light-heavyweight title, becoming the oldest professional boxer in history to win a world championship. Hopkins’s early years were troubled ones, however. He amassed a lengthy criminal record as a youth and was just seventeen when he began serving an eighteen-year prison sentence in 1982. By the time he was paroled in 1988, Hopkins was determined to turn his life around. He converted to Islam, swore off alcohol and drugs, and turned his focus to boxing. After losing his first professional bout, Hopkins rebounded with twenty-one consecutive victories and adopted the nickname “Executioner”— the persona he projects in this portrait. He took the International Boxing Federation’s middleweight title in 1995 and defended it successfully for a record-setting ten years. Moving up to the light-heavyweight class in 2006, Hopkins consistently dominated that division until November 2014, when he was dethroned at the age of forty-nine.     Bernard Hopkins  nacido en 1965  Nacido en Filadelfia, Pensilvania     En 2011, a los cuarenta y seis años, Bernard Hopkins reclamó el título de campeón de peso semicompleto otorgado por la revista The Ring, convirtiéndose en el boxeador profesional de más edad que ha ganado un campeonato mundial en la historia del deporte. No obstante, los años de juventud de Hopkins habían sido problemáticos. Amasó un largo historial criminal en su adolescencia y con solo diecisiete años ingresó en la cárcel para cumplir una sentencia de dieciocho años en 1982. Cuando logró la libertad bajo palabra en 1988, Hopkins estaba decidido a cambiar de vida. Se convirtió al islamismo, se alejó del alcohol y las drogas y se concentró en el boxeo. Luego de perder su primer encuentro profesional, se recuperó con veintiuna victorias consecutivas y adoptó el apodo de “Executioner” (Verdugo). Esa es la imagen que proyecta en este retrato. En 1995 ganó el título de peso mediano de la International Boxing Federation y lo defendió con éxito durante un período récord de diez años. En 2006 ascendió a la categoría de peso semicompleto y dominó en esa división hasta noviembre de 2014, cuando fue destronado a la edad de cuarenta y nueve años.

122688,"Born Helena, Montana  Hollywood legend Gary Cooper began his film career in the mid-1920s as an extra and bit player, but soon advanced to leading roles when studio executives recognized his on-screen charisma. Cooper’s lanky good looks, easygoing acting style, and sympathetic portrayals of everyman characters in such films as A Farewell to Arms (1932), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936), and Pride of the Yankees (1942) endeared him to legions of fans. Cooper won his first Academy Award for his moving performance as a World War I hero in Sergeant York (1941) and took home a second Oscar for his stellar work in the classic western High Noon (1952).  George Hoyingen-Heune made a series of photographs of Cooper while on assignment in Hollywood for Vanity Fair. When the magazine published one of the portraits in its September 1934 issue, the caption noted that Cooper’s “tautly modeled face represents, to thousands of women, the epitome of cinema sex appeal.”"

122864,"Born Bayonne, New Jersey     Jon Friedman’s sketch of former congressman Barney Frank is one of a series of studies made in preparation for the oil portrait commissioned by the U.S. House of Representatives. Rather than having a formal sitting, Friedman followed Frank around Washington and Boston to capture his dynamic engagement with his audience.  Frank began his political career by leaving a Harvard doctoral program in 1968 to work as Boston mayor Kevin White’s chief assistant. Soon after, Frank won a seat in the Massachusetts state legislature and introduced the state’s first two gay rights bills. Frank was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1980. Apart from his sharp tongue and wit, he is famous for being the first member of Congress to voluntarily come out as a gay man. Frank also cosponsored the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, designed to reform the financial services industry.      Barney Frank  nacido en 1940  Nacido en Bayonne, Nueva Jersey     Jon Friedman hizo este boceto del congresista Barney Frank como parte de una serie de estudios preparatorios para el retrato al óleo que le comisionó la Cámara de Representantes de EE.UU. En vez de hacerlo posar en sesiones formales, Friedman siguió a Frank en sus actividades en Washington y Boston para captar el dinamismo de sus interacciones con el público.  Frank comenzó su carrera política en1968, cuando abandonó sus estudios doctorales en Harvard para trabajar como asistente del alcalde de Boston, Kevin White. Poco después ganó una banca en la legislatura de Massachusetts y presentó los primeros dos proyectos de ley pro derechos gays en el estado. Fue elegido a la Cámara de Representantes del país en 1980. Aparte de su discurso ingenioso y mordaz, es famoso por ser el primer miembro del Congreso que se declaró gay voluntariamente.

122869,"Born Brattleboro, Vermont  Richard Morris Hunt, who trained at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, was one of the most distinguished architects in late nineteenth-century America. As founder of the American Institute of Architects, he played a critical role in establishing higher standards for training in his profession. Hunt was at the height of his career when he met French sculptor Jean Gautherin in 1886. During that pivotal year Hunt designed a variety of notable buildings around the state of New York. This bust is signed and dated by Gautherin and inscribed “F. Barbedienne,” for Ferdinand Barbedienne, the French metalworker, manufacturer, and established bronze founder. "
123011,"Born Caroline County, Virginia  In 1963 Richard and Mildred Loving went to court to challenge the Virginia law that made their interracial marriage a crime. After marrying in Washington, D.C., in 1958, the couple returned to live in Virginia, where they were jailed for violating the state’s Racial Integrity Act. The Lovings pleaded guilty but received suspended sentences, contingent upon their leaving the state and not returning together for twenty-five years. They moved to Washington but longed to be reunited with their families in Virginia. In 1963, with the help of lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, the couple sought to have their convictions and sentences set aside. When the trial judge in Virginia upheld the judgment against them and pronounced the Lovings guilty of “a most serious crime,” the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear their case. On June 12, 1967, the Court issued a unanimous opinion that state laws prohibiting interracial marriage were unconstitutional."
123197,"Born London, England  Actress Laura Keene had become a major theatrical attraction in New York City since her arrival in the United States in 1852. By the start of the Civil War, she had also demonstrated a remarkable aptitude for business, becoming the country’s first female theater manager. Our American Cousin was one of her long-running successes, which she brought to the nation’s capital in the spring of 1865. She was playing the lead role in that production the night that President Lincoln was assassinated at Ford’s Theatre.  This image shows Keene about the time she became a theater manager in 1855."
123303,"Born Santa Barbara, California     Pop star Katy Perry (born Katheryn Hudson) collaborated with New York City–based painter Will Cotton on the design of the world featured in her video for “California Gurls.” Cotton’s work, which draws on art-historical sources to explore consumer culture, caught Perry’s eye. The artist felt an affinity for Perry as well, describing her as just the kind of subject he wanted to paint: “She’s over-the-top, she’s very sugary, saccharine.” Here Cotton presents her as “Queen Katy of Candyland” in a dress constructed by designer Cynthia Rowley. Perry’s cheeky pose, wry expression, and her flawless appearance, amplified by the velvet quality of the painted surface, playfully hint at the paradoxes she straddles. Crafty and self-aware, she acknowledges that “everything I do is always with a wink.” The provocative teenage icon, chart-topping singer, and savvy businesswoman began her career singing gospel music as the daughter of Pentecostal pastors. She is the only artist after Michael Jackson to produce five number-one hits from a single album, in this case Teenage Dream (2010).    Katy Perry  nacida en 1984  Nacida en Santa Bárbara, California     La estrella pop Katy Perry (nacida Katheryn Hudson) colaboró con Will Cotton, pintor radicado en Nueva York, en el diseño del extraño mundo en que se desarrolla su video “California Gurls”. Perry quedó impresionada con el trabajo de Cotton, quien utiliza referencias de la historia del arte para explorar la cultura del consumo. A su vez, el artista sentía afinidad con Perry, a quien describió como el tipo exacto de modelo que deseaba pintar: “Es exagerada, azucarada, melosa”. Aquí Cotton la presenta como la “Reina Katy del País de los Dulces” con un vestido confeccionado por la diseñadora Cynthia Rowley. La pose jocosa de Perry, su expresión irónica y su apariencia impecable, enfatizada por la textura aterciopelada de la superficie pintada, apuntan con humor a las paradojas entre las cuales navega la cantante. Astuta y consciente de sus habilidades, Perry reconoce que “todo lo que hago es siempre con un guiño”. La icónica cantante se encuentra en el tope de las listas de éxitos y es una sagaz mujer de negocios, aunque su carrera comenzó en la música religiosa, pues es hija de pastores pentecostales. Es la única artista, después de Michael Jackson, que ha llegado al primer lugar de las listas de Billboard con cinco sencillos de un mismo disco, en este caso Teenage Dream (2010).

123309,"Born Grand Rapids, Michigan  Widely regarded as one of the best boxers in the sport today, Floyd Mayweather Jr. has amassed an impressive record of victories since joining pro boxing’s ranks in 1996—the same year he won a bronze medal at the Olympics in Atlanta. He began his professional career as a super featherweight and won his first world championship in 1998 at 130 pounds. Working his way up through the weight divisions, Mayweather has captured world titles in five different weight classes and now boxes in the welterweight category. His legendary dominance has made him one of boxing’s premier draws, and he regularly tops the list of the world’s highest-paid athletes. Beyond the ring, however, Mayweather has a tarnished reputation. Charged with domestic violence on several occasions, he has received punishments ranging from community service to jail time but has never faced sanctions from his sport. In this image Mayweather’s gaze conveys a wary defiance.    Nacido en Grand Rapids, Míchigan  Considerado uno de los mejores boxeadores de hoy, Floyd Mayweather Jr. ha acumulado un impresionante historial de victorias desde que ingresó a las filas del boxeo profesional en 1996, mismo año en que ganó medalla de bronce en las Olimpiadas de Atlanta. Comenzó su carrera como peso superpluma y ganó su primer campeonato mundial en 1998, pesando 130 libras. Continuó escalando las divisiones de peso y ha logrado títulos mundiales en cinco categorías; ahora boxea en peso wélter. Su legendario dominio en el ring lo ha convertido en una de las principales atracciones de la taquilla boxística y suele encabezar la lista de los atletas mejor pagados del mundo. No obstante, fuera del cuadrilátero tiene una reputación dudosa. Se le ha acusado de violencia doméstica en varias ocasiones y ha recibido castigos que van desde servicio comunitario hasta cárcel, pero nunca ha sido sancionado por las autoridades de su deporte. En esta imagen, su mirada comunica un desafío receloso."
123343,"Time magazine’s May 24, 1968, cover by Roy Lichtenstein featured Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy. According to Time publisher James R. Shipley, what Lichtenstein liked most about Kennedy was his “lively, upstart quality, and Pop-heroic proportions as part of a legend.” Hanging nearby are the four sheets of acetate in black, cyan, magenta, and yellow that the printer used to produce the cover; they eventually faded to tamer colors. This copy of the magazine is closer to the bold primary hues of red, yellow, and blue that Lichtenstein intended, although the blue here has turned to purple. "
123358,"Born St. Louis, Missouri  One of America’s most important writers and poets, Maya Angelou wrote a series of seven autobiographical novels that are an indelible record of resistance and achievement by African Americans, particularly African American women. Angelou had a difficult and endangered childhood, shuttling back and forth between relatives in the North and South. She suffered from economic hardship and sexual abuse, which she documented in her first book, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), and in subsequent volumes. Her subject was always her own life, and her autobiographies are not necessarily strictly factual or literally “true,” but rather a retelling of emotional truths. A politically engaged writer, Angelou was also a poet; she read her poem “On the Pulse of the Morning” at President Bill Clinton’s 1993 inauguration."
123360,"Born Los Angeles, California  Choreographer-director Busby Berkeley infused classic Hollywood musicals with kaleidoscopic dance sequences that were sheer spectacle. In such films as 42nd Street, Gold Diggers of 1933, and Footlight Parade—all released in 1933—Berkeley staged extravagant production numbers, deploying battalions of chorus girls to create fantastic, ever-changing geometric formations. To capture the scope of his complex dance numbers for Gold Diggers of 1935, Berkeley employed a custom-built, monorail-mounted motion picture camera that enabled him to orchestrate overhead shots, zoom in for close-ups, or shoot whole patterns of dancers. Berkeley’s penchant for dazzling, over-the-top effects was a perfect antidote to the Great Depression: “I tried to help people get away from all the misery,” he explained. “I wanted to make people happy, if only for an hour.”  The original press caption for this photograph notes that Berkeley is seen “looking over some of the beautiful girls needed to make up the chorus of 100 for a forthcoming cinema.” "
123361,"In Memoriam  1925–2015    Born Itta Bena, Mississippi     Long acknowledged as the undisputed “King of the Blues,” guitarist B. B. King was a consummate musi­cian whose “vocal-like string bends” and distinctive left-hand vibrato influenced generations of blues players, as well as rock guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, and Carlos Santana. Born Riley B. King, he acquired the moniker B. B.—short for Blues Boy—while performing on a West Memphis radio station in the late 1940s. After his rendition of “Three O’Clock Blues” claimed the number-one spot on the R&B charts in 1951, King and his band embarked on their first nationwide tour. Thereafter, he main­tained an ambitious touring schedule, much to the delight of his legions of fans. In 1970 King scored a huge crossover hit with “The Thrill Is Gone,” which climbed both the R&B and pop music charts to earn him the first of fifteen Grammy Awards—more than any other blues artist."
123362,"Born Philadelphia, Pennsylvania  Renowned for making songs entirely her own, Billie Holiday once explained, “I hate straight singing. I have to change a tune to my own way of doing it. That's all I know.” Holiday was still in her teens when she began singing professionally in New York City in the early 1930s. Before long, she was performing in popular jazz venues in Harlem and recording with some of the era’s best musicians. Nicknamed “Lady Day” while touring with Count Basie in 1937, she became one of the first African American vocalists to headline an all-white band when she joined Artie Shaw’s Orchestra in 1938. A year later, during an engagement at Café Society in Greenwich Village, Holiday introduced “Strange Fruit,” the haunting indictment of southern lynching that would become one of her most iconic songs. Sadly, Holiday’s life was marred by struggles with drugs and alcohol, which contributed to her death at the age of forty-four."
123380,"Born Long Beach, California  The winner of thirty-nine Grand Slam singles, doubles, and mixed-doubles titles (including twenty Wimbledon crowns), tennis great Billie Jean King has long championed gender equity both on and off the court. King made her Wimbledon debut in 1961, and by 1966 she was tennis’s top-ranked American player. In 1968—the first year that Wimbledon opened competition to professionals as well as amateurs—King turned professional and captured the All-England singles and doubles titles. Frustrated that professional tennis staged few women’s matches and that the prize money women received was a fraction of that bestowed upon male players, King helped launch the Virginia Slims women’s tennis circuit in 1970. She became a founding member and first president of the Women’s Tennis Association in 1973. That year she struck a blow for women everywhere by trouncing former tennis champion and self-proclaimed male chauvinist Bobby Riggs in the match touted as the “Battle of Sexes.”"
123483,"Born Marcellus, New York                 An anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution, Erminnie Smith did pioneering research on American Indians. She studied mineralogy in Germany and branched out into ethnohistory, concentrating on the Iroquois. Observing and recording Iroquois rituals, she compiled a dictionary of their language and also   published Myths of the Iroquois (1883).   This bas-relief by nineteenth-century portrait sculptor William Rudolf O’Donovan was illustrated as the frontispiece of Echoes of the Aesthetic Society of Jersey City (1882), a compilation of literary and scientific texts that the Daughters of the Aesthetic Society of New Jersey published in honor of Smith, their founder. "
123516,"Born Omaha, Nebraska  Although born in the Midwest, renowned artist Ed Ruscha is now identified with a particularly Californian art aesthetic. He is especially known for his series of gas stations, works derived from Hollywood movies, and the incorporation of language into his imagery. Emerging as an artist in the early 1960s, Ruscha gave the burgeoning Pop movement a West Coast spin, with his slick styling, pop-culture subjects, glossy vernacular landscapes, and references to cars or films. Post-Pop, Ruscha gave more prominence to words and phrases and also experimented with photography and film.   Artist Don Bachardy has never made preliminary sketches, preferring the immediacy and tension of sustained looking and direct drawing. Bachardy found that such “eye contact” resulted in “a real exchange of energy” between two personalities at a particular moment, and he typically has his sitter sign and date each drawing."
123517,"Born Los Angeles, California  Keeping alive the tradition of figuration even in the midst of the vogue for abstraction, California artist Don Bachardy has contributed distinctively to twentieth-century portraiture. Bachardy studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles and then at the Slade School of Art in London; his first one-man exhibition took place in London in 1961. He has mastered a particular form of portrayal few can imitate: the large-scale, closely observed life portrait drawn with graphite or light ink washes. His usual practice was to start with the eyes and scale the rest of the picture around it. As one critic has written, Bachardy “seems to leap at his subject and wring from [him] every nuance of feature and gesture with swift discerning eye.” Along with portraits of friends and acquaintances, he has made many self-portraits, applying the same standards of intense observation to his own features."
123521,"Born Santa Monica, California  Despite the buffoonish top hat and suspenders, Burt Silverman’s life drawing of Bill Irwin for a New Yorker “Profiles” essay depicts the serious man behind the clown, highlighting his imaginative intelligence. Irwin has expanded the art of comic performance by merging traditional clowning costumes and tricks with the physical humor of vaudeville, the improvisation of street fair skits, mime, dance, and the fluid movements of silent film comics. Irwin studied at Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey’s Clown College and helped found a circus in San Francisco. Eventually, however, he branched out into a variety of acting and performance roles, including serious theater—he won a Tony for his appearance in Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?—one-man shows, television, music videos, and film.

In the 1970s he founded the Turner Broadcasting System; by 1980, in creating the cable news network CNN he not only reshaped the culture of television but also the modern communications industry. He is known for his outsized personality, his ownership of the Atlanta Braves, and for his prowess as a sailor who defended the America’s Cup in 1977. In 1997 he made a pledge of one billion dollars to the United Nations Foundation. Turner is deeply invested in the future sustainability of the planet, and the philanthropic efforts of the Turner Foundation are focused on environmental causes.  Turner is one of the largest individual landowners in North America.

123548,"Born Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii  The story of Opukahaia extends far beyond the pages of this small book. Orphaned during a Hawaiian civil war, Opukahaia made his way to the mainland, eventually settling in New Haven, Connecticut, where he was known as Henry Obookiah. Under Yale student Edwin Dwight’s tutelage, Opukahaia flourished—he created the first dictionary of the Hawaiian language, for example—and converted to Christianity. In 1815 Opukahaia began to preach in local churches, pleading for a special mission to his homeland. After Opukahaia’s premature death, Dwight published his memoirs, seen by many as the impetus for the first missionaries to the Pacific islands."

Lee is posed on the veranda of the house, flanked by his son George Washington Custis Lee (right) and Colonel Walter Taylor (left).   The portrait is a punctuation to Lee’s heralded career as the South’s greatest general and serves as a summing up of an exemplary military career. Yet the portrait also looks forward to the role that Lee would fulfill in the defeated South: as the noble, honorable soldier who did his duty as he saw it in fighting for his state instead of for the Union. In the postwar period, Lee became a transcendental figure for the South, standing above party politics and individual interests to become the embodiment of all that was valuable in the so-called “Lost Cause.”  Robert E. Lee y su personal     En abril de 1865, después de la rendición en Appomattox, Mathew Brady se dirigió a Richmond para tomar este retrato de Lee en la casa alquilada donde su familia había pasado la Guerra Civil. Lee está posando en la galería de la casa, acompañado de su hijo George Washington Custis Lee (derecha) y del coronel Walter Taylor (izquierda).                   El retrato está apuntado a la carrera anunciada de Lee como el general más grande del sur y funciona para resumir una carrera militar ejemplar. Sin embargo, el retrato también adelanta el rol que Lee desempeñaría en el sur derrotado: como el noble, honorable soldado que cumplió con su deber según como lo veía y peleó por su estado en lugar de por la Unión. El en periodo de posguerra, Lee se convirtió en una figura trascendental para el sur; al estar por encima de la política de partidos e intereses individuales, se convirtió en la personificación de todo los que era valorable en la llamada ""causa perdida"".

123748,"Peggy Bacon began her career as a painter but found early success with her satirical prints and drawings of friends and associates. Her work for magazines such as the New Yorker, Vanity Fair, and Fortune expanded from illustration to satirical caricature after the publication of her 1934 book, Off with Their Heads. In this book of caricatures, she describes herself as follows: “Pin headed, parsimoniously covered with thin dark hair, on a short, dumpy body. Small features, prominent nose, chipmunk teeth and no chin, conveying the sharp weak look of a little rodent.”  This pastel self-portrait demonstrates Bacon’s unforgiving eye—particularly through the cartoonish line of her head in profile. It also shows how biting Bacon’s caricature could be, applying to not only other prominent art figures of the 1930s, but also herself.     Peggy Bacon empezó su carrera como pintora, pero pronto logró éxito con sus grabados y dibujos satíricos de amigos y asociados. Su trabajo para revistas como The New Yorker, Vanity Fair y Fortune se extendió de la ilustración a la caricatura satírica luego de publicarse en 1934 su libro Off With Their Heads (Que les corten la cabeza). En este libro de caricaturas, se describe a sí misma así: “Cabeza de chorlito, cubierta frugalmente de cabello oscuro fino, sobre un cuerpo bajito y regordete. Facciones menudas, nariz prominente, dientes de ardilla y nada de mentón, con el aspecto picudo y débil de un pequeño roedor”.  Este autorretrato al pastel demuestra la mirada implacable de Bacon, especialmente en el trazo de su perfil, al estilo de un dibujo animado. También muestra lo incisivas que podían ser las caricaturas de Bacon, lo mismo aplicadas a otras figuras artísticas prominentes de los años treinta que a sí misma."

In 1941, he and his wife Irene made their first trip to Puerto Rico. It made such an impression on the couple that they moved there in 1946. The Delanos became central to the island’s cultural development, working with its government toward the establishment of a modern cultural apparatus for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, founded in 1952. A man of many talents, Delano became te director of the island’s first public broadcasting station. He also made films about the island, composed music scores for its orchestra and ballet, and made some of the most iconic and dignified images of its people over his four-decade stay there.  Portraiture has been central to multidisciplinary artist Antonio Martorell, who has since the late 1960s depicted some of Puerto Rico’s most prominent cultural and political figures.     Jack Delano, nacido en Ucrania y criado en Estados Unidos, fue contratado en 1940 por la Farm Security Administration (administración de protección agrícola creada para combatir la pobreza rural durante la Gran Depresión) para documentar la vida de los trabajadores en la costa este, Chicago y los territorios estadounidenses en el Caribe. En 1941, él y su esposa Irene hicieron su primer viaje a Puerto Rico. La isla les causó tal impresión que se mudaron a ella en 1946. Los Delano fueron figuras centrales para el desarrollo cultural de la isla y colaboraron con el gobierno en el establecimiento de una estructura administrativa moderna para la cultura en el Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, fundado en 1952. Hombre de muchos talentos, Delano fue director de la primera estación de radio y televisión pública de la isla. También hizo películas sobre la isla, compuso piezas musicales para orquesta y ballet, y creó algunas de las imágenes más icónicas y dignas de la gente puertorriqueña durante las cuatro décadas que vivió allí.

123786,"One of the first Latina authors to be published by a major U.S. press, Nicholasa Mohr was born to Puerto Rican parents who moved to New York at the height of the Great Depression. In 1973 Mohr published her first novel, Nilda, about a young girl coming of age in New York City during World War II while her mother was raising a family of six. The New York Times selected it Outstanding Book of the Year, launching Mohr’s literary career. Other works include the short story collection El Bronx Remembered (1975), the novel Felita (1979), and its sequel, Going Home (1986). Mohr’s books center on the experience of growing up Puerto Rican in the United States and are populated with resilient characters who endure hardship, pushing ahead for a better life.  Here, Antonio Martorell’s agile line captures Mohr’s vivacious personality, while recognizing her stature as a pillar of Nuyorican (New York–Puerto Rican) literature.     Nicholasa Mohr, una de las primeras autoras latinas cuya obra fue publicada por una editorial estadounidense importante, es hija de padres puertorriqueños que se mudaron a Nueva York en el apogeo de la Gran Depresión. En 1973 publicó su primera novela, Nilda, sobre una joven que llega a la adultez en la ciudad de Nueva York durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, mientras su madre cría a seis hijos. El New York Times lo seleccionó como Libro Sobresaliente del Año, lo cual lanzó la carrera literaria de Mohr. Entre sus demás obras se encuentra la colección de cuentos El Bronx Remembered (1975), la novela Felita (1979) y su secuela, Going Home (1986). Los libros de Mohr se centran en la vivencia de crecer como puertorriqueño en Estados Unidos y están poblados de personajes resilientes que hacen frente a situaciones adversas y se forjan una vida mejor.

She became one of the industry’s brightest and most versatile stars, excelling in music, theater, movies, and television. As a singer, Streisand rose to the top of the charts in the mid-1960s with multiple Grammys, and she is one the best-selling recording artists of all time. Streisand’s motion picture debut in Funny Girl (1968) earned her the Academy Award for Best Actress. She continued her on-screen career in such films as Hello, Dolly (1969), The Way We Were (1973), and A Star is Born (1976) before branching into producing and directing. In this consciously crafted comment on celebrity, Deb Kass celebrates Streisand’s solid gold accomplishments using an image from Funny Girl, in which the actress played Fanny Brice, another boundary-breaking female entertainer.    Gold Barbra  Barbra Streisand  nacida en 1942  Nacida en Brooklyn, Nueva York     Si bien aún goza de una posición privilegiada entre las figuras del entretenimiento, Barbra Streisand tenía apenas veintidós años cuando se adueñó de Broadway con el exitoso musical Funny Girl (1964). Se convirtió en una de las estrellas más brillantes y versátiles de la industria, destacándose en música, teatro, cine y televisión. Como cantante, Streisand ascendió al tope de las listas de éxitos a mediados de los años sesenta con múltiples premios Grammy, y sus discos están entre los de mayor venta de todos los tiempos. Su debut cinematográfico en Funny Girl (1968) le ganó el Oscar a la mejor actriz y prosiguió su carrera con filmes como Hello, Dolly (1969), The Way We Were (1973) y A Star Is Born (1976) antes de incursionar en el campo de la producción y la dirección.

Hunter-Gault and Holmes were suspended, ostensibly for their safety. They returned under a new court order, and as Hunter-Gault states, they were “determined as ever to stay the course.”  This portrait by Joseph Schwarz, an art professor who helped organize a faculty resolution to reinstate the suspended students, captures Hunter-Gault’s detached determination—a quality that helped see her through a tension-filled education at the University of Georgia, and to which she attributes her subsequent success.

123868,"Born Pusan, South Korea     One of the most prominent Asian American television actors, Daniel Dae Kim immigrated to the United States from South Korea as a young child. He earned a theater degree from Haverford College, which led him to pursue a career as a stage actor in New York City before returning to school. He graduated with an MFA from New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts in 1989. He then branched into film and television work, gaining notoriety for his role as Jin Kwon on the cult hit show Lost (2004–10). At the outset of the show, Kim’s character only spoke Korean. Over the course of several seasons, however, the character began to learn English, requiring Kim to act in both his native and adopted languages, which, he says, greatly improved his Korean.

123904,"Dennis Hopper and Peter Fonda’s low-budget counterculture film Easy Rider was a sensation when it was released in 1969. It also helped make B-movie actor Jack Nicholson (born 1937) into a star. Nicholson plays a small-town Louisiana lawyer who gets the main characters out of jail and then rides away with them in pursuit of the quintessential American dream—the freedom of the open road. He is killed in a savage beating when the trio is attacked by hostile locals. An unlikely hit, Easy Rider introduced Nicholson, and his trademark wise-guy smirk, to a national audience. Hollywood took notice, too: he caught the attention of directors like Stanley Kubrick and a year later received a Best Actor nomination for his role in Five Easy Pieces (1970)."
123905,"In July 1970, five years after the beginning of the grape strike, the UFW reached a landmark achievement when it signed contracts with twenty-three companies, including the extensive landowners Giumarra. Eighty-five percent of all table-grape growers in California were now under a union contract. The victory was short-lived, however, as the opposing Teamsters union started competing with the UFW in Salinas. Without the approval of its Salinas members, the Teamsters leadership signed contracts that favored the growers by granting small raises, but no fringe benefits, to the workers. As a result, the UFW revived the intensity of its boycott, launching new strikes. Relations between the unions grew tenser as the Teamsters hired strongmen to intimidate UFW picketers. In 1973, the Modesto-based Gallo Winery, the nation’s largest vintner and one of the first to have signed with the UFW in 1967, saw its contract expire and signed instead with the Teamsters. Chávez responded with a boycott of Gallo Wines.   ¡Únase al boicot! ¡No compre vinos Gallo!     En julio de 1970, a cinco años de iniciada la huelga de la uva, la UFW alcanzó un logro histórico al firmar contratos con veintitrés compañías, incluidos los grandes productores de Giumarra. El ochenta por ciento de los productores de uvas de mesa en California estaban ahora bajo convenios colectivos. Sin embargo, la victoria duró poco, porque el sindicato antagónico de los Tronquistas empezó a competir con la UFW en Salinas. Sin la aprobación de sus miembros de Salinas, los Tronquistas firmaron convenios que favorecían a los rancheros, ya que a pesar de que concedían a los trabajadores pequeños aumentos de sueldo, no ofrecían ningún beneficio marginal. A raíz de esto, la UFW intensificó su boicot con nuevas huelgas. Las relaciones entre los sindicatos se tornaron más tensas cuando los Tronquistas comenzaron a emplear matones para intimidar a los piqueteros de la UFW. En 1973, las bodegas Gallo, ubicadas en Modesto, que eran la productora de vinos más grande del país y una de las primeras que firmaron contratos con la UFW en 1967, decidió, al expirar el contrato, firmar con los Tronquistas.

Chicana artist Barbara Carrasco made this portrait in homage to Huerta. Carrasco became a supporter of the farm workers’ movement in the 1970s and served for decades as a volunteer staff artist for the UFW. Carrasco, who considers Huerta her mentor and a close friend, explained her motivations for this portrait: “There are so many icons of men, and icons of women painted by men, that I wanted (as a woman) to create an iconic image of Huerta to recognize her as an equal of César Chávez and, historically, the most important negotiator for the United Farm Workers.”      Dolores Huerta      Con su ejemplo como líder laboral y defensora de los derechos civiles, a la vez que desafió las reglas que restringían el papel de la mujer en sociedad, Huerta se convirtió en uno de los primeros símbolos del poder femenino para los movimientos chicano y feminista.   La artista chicana Barbara Carrasco realizó este retrato en homenaje a Huerta. Carrasco fue simpatizante del movimiento de los trabajadores agrícolas durante los años setenta y trabajó por varias décadas como artista voluntaria para la UFW. Considera a Huerta su mentora y amiga, y explicó así lo que la motivó a hacer este retrato: “Existen tantos iconos de hombres, e iconos de mujeres pintados por hombres, que quise [como mujer] crear una imagen icónica de Huerta para honrarla como figura a la altura de César Chávez y como la negociadora más importante en la historia de la Unión de Trabajadores Campesinos”.

Empezó trabajando en la oficina de correspondencia de la legendaria disquera Fania Records, pero rápidamente se destacó como compositor y vocalista para el percusionista estrella Ray Barretto y el pianista Larry Harlow. En 1978 lanzó, con el trombonista Willie Colón, el superexitoso álbum Siembra, en el cual figura su emblemática canción “Pedro Navaja”. En 1984, el grupo de Blades, Seis del Solar, grabó Buscando América, que recibió críticas elogiosas por su hábil integración de rock y jazz con el sonido latino y en el cual destacan sus típicas letras poéticas sobre la vida cotidiana y los temas sociales. Blades colaboró con Lou Reed, Elvis Costello y Sting en su álbum en inglés Nothing but the Truth (1988). El once veces ganador del premio Grammy también es actor y político. Fue candidato para la presidencia de Panamá en 1994.  El fotógrafo Máximo Colón viene documentando con avidez el ambiente musical latino en las calles y clubs de la ciudad de Nueva York desde la década de 1970.   "
123978,"   With a career spanning more than fifty years and forty albums, pianist Eddie Palmieri has been for decades a defining figure in the development of salsa and Latin jazz. Initiated in the instrument as a young boy, in 1955 he debuted in Johnny Seguí’s orchestra, a main staple of New York City’s legendary Palladium Ballroom. In 1961 he formed the band La Perfecta, pioneering a blend of Afro-Latin rhythms with American jazz along with a heavy frontline of trombones that replaced the traditional trumpets in Latin orchestras. His musical experimentation continued through the next decade and earned him the first of ten Grammy Awards for The Sun of Latin Music (1975). Palmieri’s music is at once cerebral and soulful, synthesizing his Puerto Rican heritage with jazz influences, including his brother Charlie Palmieri, as well as Thelonious Monk, Herbie Hancock, and McCoy Tyner. In this portrait, Máximo Colón captures the intensity of Palmieri’s incendiary solos.      Con una carrera que abarca más de cincuenta años y cuarenta discos, el pianista Eddie Palmieri ha sido durante décadas una figura decisiva en el desarrollo de los géneros de la salsa y el jazz latino. Empezó a tocar el piano desde muy joven y en 1955 debutó en la orquesta de Johnny Seguí, atracción del legendario Palladium Ballroom de la ciudad de Nueva York. En 1961 formó la banda La Perfecta, pionera en la fusión de ritmos afrolatinos con el jazz norteamericano, a la cual integró una primera línea de trombones en lugar de las trompetas tradicionales de las orquestas latinas. Su experimentación musical continuó en la década siguiente y le trajo el primero de sus diez premios Grammy (por The Sun of Latin Music, 1975). La música de Palmieri es a la vez cerebral y emotiva, una síntesis de su herencia puertorriqueña con influencias del jazz que incluyen a su hermano Charlie Palmieri así como a Thelonious Monk, Herbie Hancock y McCoy Tyner. En este retrato, Máximo Colón capta la intensidad de los solos incendiarios de Palmieri.                 NPG.2015.53   "
124056,"Born New York City     Combining Latin rhythms, ballads, and mainstream pop music, Marc Anthony is one of today’s most significant crossover artists, selling more than twelve million albums worldwide. This photograph shows the singer, who is of Puerto Rican heritage, just as he hit his stride with his first salsa records, between 1993 and 1997. These established him as one of the all-time top-selling artists in the genre. The viewer looks at the singer, with his arms extended and head toward the sky, in a posture that conveys his natural and enduring stage presence. Anthony’s eponymous English album from 2000 went triple-platinum, heralding the beginning of a Latin pop explosion in the United States. Twenty years later, his success is undiminished; he won ten awards at the 2014 Billboard Latin Music Awards, including Hot Latin Song for his life-affirming “Vivir mi vida.”       Marc Anthony  nacido en 1968  Nacido en la ciudad de Nueva York      Con un repertorio que combina ritmos latinos con baladas y música pop, Marc Anthony es uno de los artistas más destacados del crossover, habiendo vendido más de doce millones de discos en el mundo. Esta fotografía muestra al cantante de raíces puertorriqueñas cuando empezaba a triunfar con sus primeros discos de salsa, entre 1993 y 1997. Para esa época se estableció como uno de los salseros de más ventas de todos los tiempos. Aquí lo vemos con los brazos extendidos y la cabeza girada hacia el cielo, en una pose que comunica la naturalidad y solidez de su presencia escénica. En el año 2000, su disco titulado Marc Anthony alcanzó el nivel de triple platino en ventas, augurando el comienzo de una explosión latina en la música pop de Estados Unidos. Veinte años después, su éxito no ha menguado: en los Premios Billboard de la Música Latina 2014 ganó diez galardones, entre ellos Hot Latin Song por su canto al optimismo, “Vivir mi vida”.

124082,"Born Rosita Dolores Alverio, Rita Moreno is one of the few entertainers to have won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony. Best known for her portrayal of Anita in the 1961 film West Side Story, Moreno said, “I knew this girl. You know, I’ve been Anita.” This role earned her the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award, making her the first Latina to receive an Oscar. Additional tributes include a Golden Globe, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award. Upon receiving the National Medal of Arts in 2009, Moreno said, “I come from an era . . . where you couldn’t just be a singer or a dancer. You did it all.” On December 6, 2015, she added a Kennedy Center Honors award to this list.  The absence of positive portrayals of Puerto Ricans in the American media led New York City–based photographer ADÁL to systematically document trailblazers in the arts, science, and community activism.    Bautizada como Rosita Dolores Alverio, Rita Moreno es una de las pocas figuras del mundo del espectáculo que ha ganado un Emmy, un Grammy, un Oscar y un Tony. Su papel más conocido es el de Anita en la película West Side Story de 1961, del cual dijo: “Yo conocía a esa chica. Yo he sido Anita”. Con ese papel ganó el premio de la Academia a la mejor actriz de reparto, siendo la primera latina en recibir un Oscar. Otros galardones incluyen un Golden Globe, la Medalla Presidencial de la Libertad y un Premio a la Trayectoria del sindicato de actores de cine, Screen Actors Guild. Al recibir la Medalla Nacional de las Artes en 2009, Rita Moreno dijo: “Vengo de una época… en la que no podías ser solo cantante o solo bailarina. Hacías de todo”. El 6 de diciembre de 2015, agregó el premio del Kennedy Center a esta lista de honores.  La ausencia de retratos positivos de los puertorriqueños en los medios estadounidenses motivó al fotógrafo ADÁL, radicado en Nueva York, a documentar sistemáticamente a figuras pioneras que abrieron brecha en las artes, las ciencias y el activismo comunitario."
124159,"Elaine carried this charcoal drawing to a high degree of completion and then added collaged pieces of paper to it. The likeness seems to express what Elaine was looking for in her efforts to capture the president’s elusive image: ""In succeeding sessions of sketching, I was struck by the curious faceted structure of light over his face and hair—a quality of transparent ruddiness. The play of light contributed to the extraordinary variety of expressions. His smile and frown both seemed to be built-in to the bone. Everyone is familiar with the quick sense of humor revealed in the corners of his mouth and the laugh lines around the eyes, but what impressed me most was a sense of compassion.""  Elaine trabajó a fondo este dibujo en carboncillo y luego le añadió pedacitos de papel a manera de collage. La obra parece expresar sus esfuerzos por captar la elusiva imagen de presidente: “En sucesivas sesiones de dibujo me impactó la curiosa composición de facetas que la luz creaba sobre su cara y su pelo, un velo de sonrosada transparencia. El juego de luces realzaba su extraordinaria variedad de expresiones. Lo mismo si sonreía o fruncía el ceño, sus gestos parecían integrados a su estructura ósea. Todos conocen ese humor ágil que revelan las comisuras de sus labios y las arrugas alrededor de los ojos cuando sonríe, pero lo que más me impresionó fue su sentido de la compasión”.   "

The computer-controlled camera’s motion is synchronized exactly to the subject’s height and the duration of the music. Unlike Gehring’s previous portraits, the sitter here is a celebrity: the record-breaking bassist, composer, and singer Esperanza Spalding. Spalding won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist of 2011, a first for a jazz musician.  For her portrait’s musical component, Spalding chose “Tarde” (1974) by Wayne Shorter—an artist who greatly influenced Spalding—which includes Shorter on the tenor saxophone and Herbie Hancock on the electric piano. As the camera scans Spalding’s body, we see the shimmer and textures of her carefully selected clothing and jewelry, and at the end, a face enraptured by the music—a rare glimpse of a star enjoying a private moment.    Esperanza Spalding  nacida en 1984  Nacida en Portland, Oregón     Los retratos de Bo Gehring son registros visuales y auditivos de sus modelos, a quienes vemos acostados boca arriba mientras reaccionan a una pieza musical que han seleccionado ellos mismos a la vez que una cámara se mueve lentamente sobre ellos. Los movimientos de la cámara son controlados por computadora y van sincronizados exactamente con la estatura del sujeto y la duración de la música. A diferencia de retratos anteriores de Gehring, la modelo aquí es una celebridad: la bajista, compositora y cantante Esperanza Spalding, ganadora del premio Grammy a la mejor artista nueva en 2011, una primicia para una intérprete de jazz.  Como componente musical de su retrato, Spalding seleccionó “Tarde” (1974) de Wayne Shorter, artista que ha ejercido gran influencia en ella. La pieza incluye a Shorter en el saxofón tenor y a Herbie Hancock en el piano eléctrico. A medida que la cámara explora el cuerpo de Spalding, vemos el brillo y las texturas de su cuidado vestuario y sus joyas, y al final un rostro cautivado por la música... un raro atisbo de una estrella que disfruta un momento privado.

Artist Karin Sander’s diminutive 3-D scanned portrait reflects the architect’s sense of herself as a small part of a global environment.

Maya Lin  nacida en 1959  Nacida en Athens, Ohio     Siendo aún estudiante en la Universidad de Yale, Maya Lin redefinió la noción convencional de los monumentos a los héroes de guerra con su comedido y controversial diseño para el monumento conmemorativo de los veteranos de Vietnam en Washington, D.C.

124361,"Born into slavery, Frederick Douglass was determined by his early teens to escape his bondage. In 1838, he fled northward to settle in Massachusetts, where he became a key figure in the abolitionist movement. He gained widespread respect for his 1845 autobiography and zealous, eloquent oratorical skills.   The theme of fugitive slaves in popular imagery and contemporary songs of the 1840s reflected either the anxiety of slaveholders or mounting support for the abolitionist cause. This music sheet cover of “The Fugitive’s Song” turns on its head the traditional newspaper advertisement for a fugitive slave to honor the esteemed leader. Although it depicts Douglass neither as writer not orator, but as a barefooted slave in flight, pointing at a signpost to New England seen on the right, the text below praises Douglass for his “fearless advocacy.” The song was one of a number of abolitionist compositions created by Jesse Hutchinson of the famous Hutchinson Family singers.     Al llegar a la adolescencia, Frederick Douglass, quien nació esclavo, ya estaba resuelto a escapar de su esclavitud. En 1838, se fugó hacia el norte y se estableció en Massachusetts, donde se convirtió en una figura clave del movimiento abolicionista. Llegó a ser muy respetado por su autobiografía (1845) y por su elocuencia oratoria.  El tema de los esclavos fugitivos en la imaginería popular y las canciones de la década de 1840 reflejaba por un lado la ansiedad de los amos y por otro el creciente apoyo a la causa abolicionista. Esta portada de la partitura de “La canción del fugitivo” da un giro al anuncio tradicional de búsqueda de un esclavo fugitivo en los diarios y lo convierte en un homenaje al estimado líder Frederick Douglass. Aunque no lo ilustra como escritor ni orador, sino como un esclavo descalzo que huye y señala un letrero hacia Nueva Inglaterra, el texto al pie alaba a Douglass por su “defensa intrépida” de la causa abolicionista. Esta fue una de varias canciones abolicionistas creadas por Jesse Hutchinson, de la famosa familia Hutchinson de cantantes."
124379,"Elaine used cross-hatching in the background of this charcoal study of John Ashbery as well as within the image itself. Scratches within the eyes create a sense of movement and confuse the space. One critic commented, ""Ashbery faces the viewer directly but his stare is harsher, more intensely focused. Much of the figure is crosshatched in grays, as is the background. The fine mesh reminds one that a concern with the fluid borders of persons and their environments is one of Ashbery’s major themes.""  En 1984 Elaine aportó un retrato de John Ashbery para una edición limitada de grabados inspirados en su famoso poema “Self-portrait in a Convex Mirror” (1973), incluido también en la edición. Otros siete artistas, entre ellos Willem de Kooning, crearon obras de formato circular para el proyecto. Cada uno reaccionó al poema de manera distinta, enviando autorretratos, retratos de Ashbery e imágenes personales.    Elaine había pintado a Ashbery en 1975, cuando se publicó el libro que contiene el poema en cuestión. Esta pintura le sirvió de referencia en los dibujos preliminares para la litografía. Primero utilizó medios mixtos para transformar la imagen pintada en una imagen gráfica fuerte y de formato circular. Para el estudio final a carboncillo utilizó un entramado de líneas en el fondo y en el rostro. El rayado dentro de los ojos crea una sensación de movimiento y confunde el espacio. Un crítico comentó que “Ashbery mira al observador directamente, pero su mirada es más dura, más intensa. Gran parte de la figura está construida con líneas entrecruzadas en tonos de gris, igual que el fondo. Esa fina malla me recuerda que uno de los grandes temas de Ashbery es la fluidez entre el contorno y el entorno de las personas”."
124413,"Elaine made many small drawings of the president’s features throughout 1963. Some focus on the entire face, but others, like this one, focus primarily on his eyes. She recalled that many of her sketches combined her own observation with images that registered in her memory, partly because the president was always shifting and moving in front of her. Elaine was particularly concerned about capturing his expressions and his eyes. She noted, ""you never know where ‘likeness’ will reside"" and mentioned her struggles in her sketches of Kennedy with an ""un-like"" quality that ""stemmed from a ridiculously little thing that curiously enough involved his key feature—his eyes."" She concluded, ""It would be possible to portray the man by drawing or painting only his eyes, so that he would be recognized instantly.""  Elaine hizo muchos dibujos pequeños de la facciones del presidente a lo largo de 1963. Algunos se centran en la cara completa, pero otros, como este, ponen la atención en los ojos. Según comentó, muchos de sus bocetos combinaban sus observaciones con imágenes que tenía en la memoria, en parte porque el presidente siempre se estaba moviendo y cambiando de postura. Le preocupaba especialmente captar sus expresiones y sus ojos. Decía que “nunca se sabe dónde va a estar el detalle que te dé el ‘parecido’”, y hablaba de cómo luchó en los bocetos con un aspecto que se le escapaba: “era algo minúsculo, que curiosamente tenía que ver con su rasgo clave, los ojos. [...] Se podría hacer un retrato de este hombre con solo dibujar o pintar los ojos, y sería reconocible al instante”. "

Longoria is a fixture on numerous “most beautiful” lists and a fashion icon. Her work beneath and beyond the national spotlight—as a philanthropist, social activist, and businesswoman—has garnered her equal, if not greater, acclaim than her onscreen work. Her casual but self-assured appearance in this portrait carries a   quality of everydayness that celebrates female power. Longoria is the founder of Eva’s Heroes, an organization committed to enriching the lives of developmentally challenged youth; she has served as executive producer of the documentaries The Harvest and Food Chains, about farm work and social justice. In 2013 she received a master’s degree in Chicano studies from California State University, Northridge.

She has tossed the first pitch at a Yankees game, dropped the ball at Times Square on New Year’s Eve 2013, and drew large crowds during the tour for her best-selling memoir, My Beloved World. Her public appeal derives not just from her apparent accessibility but also from the power of her personal story as a child raised by her widowed mother in the housing projects of the Bronx.

A self-described Nuyorican (“New York–Puerto Rican”), Sotomayor is the first Latina and third woman to serve on the country’s highest court.

During these sessions, Davidson began a series of portraits of Pitt, including this one, made just before Pitt cut his hair short for the filming of Fury (2014).

In the 1970s he plunged into the study of Afro-Cuban music and eventually led the Orquesta Típica Cienfuegos (1976–80), the award-winning Batachanga Orchestra (1981–85), and the Machete Ensemble (1985–2006). Known for his experimental blend of contemporary and traditional musical forms from the African diaspora, Santos is also widely respected as a composer, producer, and teacher.  Photographer Frank Espada and Santos met in the mid-1980s and became close friends. This portrait became part of Espada’s Puerto Rican Diaspora Documentary Project, an effort he began the 1960s; by the 1980s it had blossomed into a touring exhibition and a book.      El percusionista John Santos es uno de los principales exponentes del jazz afrolatino en la zona de la bahía de San Francisco. Nacido en una familia de músicos procedentes de Cabo Verde y Puerto Rico, ya a los trece años Santos tocaba las congas en la banda latina tropical de su abuelastro. En la década de 1970 se sumergió en el estudio de la música afrocubana y luego dirigió la Orquesta Típica Cienfuegos (1976-80), la premiada Orquesta Batachanga (1981-85) y el Machete Ensemble (1985-2006). Conocido por su fusión experimental de formas musicales contemporáneas y tradicionales de la diáspora africana, Santos es muy respetado como compositor, productor y maestro.  El fotógrafo Frank Espada y Santos se conocieron a mediados de la década de 1980 y se hicieron buenos amigos. Este retrato fue parte del proyecto documental The Puerto Rican Diaspora de Espada, obra que empezó en la década de 1960 y que para los años ochenta había engendrado una exposición itinerante y un libro.

125255,"Born Chicago, Illinois     Sandra Cisneros is the most prominent Latina voice in American literature. She drew upon her experience as the daughter of a working-class Mexican American family in Chicago in her first published work, The House on Mango Street (1984), which earned her the coveted American Book Award and became required reading in public schools and universities across the country. Cisneros was the first Latina to become a MacArthur Fellow (1995), and in 2002 the New York Times and other national newspapers selected her novel Caramelo as a notable book of the year. Cisneros projects herself in different ways in her many existing portraits, as if alluding to her free mind as a writer—wearing pink wigs or animal print coats, or with her Virgin of Guadalupe tattoo exposed. Here we see her with her dog on the porch of her former residence in San Antonio, smiling at the viewer and wearing native Mexican attire.    Sandra Cisneros  nacida en 1954  Nacida en Chicago, Illinois     Sandra Cisneros es la voz latina más prominente en la literatura norteamericana. Sus experiencias dentro de una familia mexicano-americana de clase trabajadora en Chicago le sirvieron de inspiración para su primera publicación, The House on Mango Street (1984), que le ganó el codiciado Premio del Libro Americano y pasó a ser lectura obligada en las escuelas públicas y universidades del país. Cisneros fue la primera latina que recibió la beca MacArthur (1995) y en 2002 el New York Times  y otros periódicos nacionales seleccionaron su novela Caramelo entre los libros notables del año.

125256,"A forerunner in the fight against gender identity discrimination, Sylvia Rivera worked the dicey Times Square district as a trans woman sex worker after she was cast out by family as a teenager. She was there in 1969 at the turning point of the modern LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) struggle for equal rights, when patrons of the Stonewall Inn violently rebuffed a police raid. Politicized by this experience, Rivera campaigned with the Gay Activist Alliance (GAA) in urging the city to enact a nondiscrimination ordinance. However, facing racism and discrimination as a Latina transgender by the mainly white male GAA leadership, she began to work with homeless teenagers, co-founding the militant group and shelter STAR (Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries). In the 1990s Rivera was embraced as one of the fundamental figures of the LGBT movement. This portrait shows her flanked by her partner Julia Murray (right) and activist Christina Hayworth at the Saturday Rally before New York’s Gay Pride Parade in 2000."
125370,"Born McComb, Mississippi      Luke DuBois’s portrait of Britney Spears plays on the traditional meaning of an icon as an object of veneration in religious art. In a gilt frame normally surrounding an image of the Virgin Mary is a collage of moving images culled from Spears’s music videos. Spears became a teen sensation with her first album, Baby One More Time (1999), going on to shatter multiple sales records and win more than seventy music awards. DuBois considers Spears, the subject of both public adoration and ridicule, the perfect candidate for a contemporary digital pop icon. The work shows her many carefully choreographed faces, using a computational process that locks her eyes in place while the video pans from one image to the next. The effect of blurring the images both dulls and intensifies her celebrity allure. Instead of her music, DuBois has substituted the reverberations of an Italian basilica known for its devotional iconography. Spears’s pop icon status remains intact: she is currently performing in Las Vegas for a two-year residency.    (Pop) Icon: Britney  Britney Spears  nacida en 1981  Nacida en McComb, Misisipi      En este retrato de Britney Spears, Luke DuBois juega con el concepto tradicional del icono como objeto de veneración en el arte religioso. Dentro de un marco dorado que normalmente encerraría una imagen de la Virgen María, vemos un collage de imágenes en movimiento tomadas de los videos musicales de Spears. La cantante se convirtió en una sensación juvenil con su primer disco, Baby One More Time (1999), y prosiguió a romper múltiples récords de venta, ganando más de setenta premios de la música. DuBois considera a Spears, objeto tanto de admiración como de burla pública, la candidata perfecta para un icono pop contemporáneo en formato digital. La obra muestra los muchos gestos de la cantante, cuidadosamente coreografiados, mediante un proceso digital que permite dejar sus ojos fijos mientras el video se desplaza de una imagen a otra. La manera en que se difuminan las imágenes tiene el efecto doble de opacar e intensificar el atractivo que genera la celebridad de Spears. En vez de su música, DuBois ha incorporado las reverberaciones de una iglesia italiana conocida por su iconografía devocional. La condición de Spears como icono pop ha permanecido intacta: ahora presenta en Las Vegas un espectáculo que se extenderá por dos años.

125487,"Born Morristown, New Jersey     Peter Dinklage has been acting since high school, where he became involved in theater as a way to find his own community. He was born with achondroplasia, a genetic condition causing dwarfism, which made being accepted in school difficult at times. As a young actor, Dinklage struggled to find work beyond stage and independent film roles until a friend crafted a part specifically for him in The Station Agent (2003). The film won an audience award at the Sundance Film Festival and brought Dinklage greater recognition. His role in the HBO series Game of Thrones has made him a household name and earned him both Emmy and Golden Globe awards. Dinklage accepts roles referencing his height if he feels they are not exploitative but prefers to compete for parts never intended for someone his size. This philosophy is reflected in this image, where his direct, open gaze challenges the viewer to acknowledge but look past his condition.

125495,"Musician, writer, and artist Patti Smith is known for her paradigm-shifting creativity throughout her career. Fleeing suburban life for New York City in 1967, Smith wrote poetry and dabbled in photography and drawing before releasing her cutting-edge debut album Horses (1975), which fused her love of poetry with songwriting. Smith memorialized this time in her life in the memoir Just Kids, which won the National Book Award in 2010.  In this raw, edgy self-portrait drawn in 1974, Smith depicts herself in a colorful top, staring out at the viewer with a punk rock attitude. The inscription reads, “All the things he gave me,” referring to her relationship in the early 1970s with Blue Öyster Cult band member Allen Lanier. Smith describes the work with her characteristic emphatic prose and sensitivity: “The felt Berber hat. A tiny platinum tear-drop necklace. An ivory camel. . . . Though a mere sketch it was done with great care in recognition to the giver.”    La cantautora, escritora y artista visual Patti Smith es conocida por su creatividad que desafía los paradigmas. Huyendo de una vida acomodada, se fue a la ciudad de Nueva York en 1967, donde escribió poesía y probó la fotografía y el dibujo antes de lanzar su vanguardista álbum Horses (1975). Smith plasmó sus memorias de esta época de su vida en el libro Just Kids, que ganó el Premio Nacional del Libro de EE.UU. en 2010.

La inscripción dice: “Todas las cosas que él me dio”, refiriéndose a su relación a inicios de la década de 1970 con Allen Lanier, integrante de la banda Blue Öyster Cult. Smith describe la obra con la sensibilidad y la prosa enfática que la caracterizan: “El sombrero bereber de fieltro. Un collar con una diminuta lágrima de platino. Un camello de marfil… Aunque esto no sea más que un boceto, fue hecho con mucho cuidado en reconocimiento de quien me dio estas cosas”."
125527,"Seiji Ozawa made history in 1972 when he accepted the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s offer to serve as music director for its 1973–74 season, thus becoming the youngest principal conductor and the first of Asian heritage to helm that storied orchestra. Mentored earlier in his career by the legendary Leonard Bernstein, who hired him as an assistant conductor of the New York Philharmonic in 1960, Ozawa was only twenty-five when he took the podium at Carnegie Hall for his debut with that orchestra in 1961. His association with the Philharmonic was followed by conducting duties for several major North American orchestras, including the Chicago, Toronto, and San Francisco symphonies. But it was during his twenty-nine seasons in Boston (1973–2002) that Ozawa solidified his reputation as a brilliant and facile conductor who relished classical and romantic repertory but who also delighted in championing a range of challenging works by modern composers.     Seiji Ozawa hizo historia en 1972 cuando aceptó la oferta de la Orquesta Sinfónica de Boston para ser director musical en su temporada 1973-74, convirtiéndose en el titular más joven, y el primero de origen asiático, a la cabeza de esa ilustre orquesta. En una etapa temprana de su carrera, tuvo como mentor al legendario Leonard Bernstein, quien lo contrató como director asistente de la Filarmónica de Nueva York en 1960. Ozawa tenía tan solo veinticinco años cuando subió al podio en Carnegie Hall para debutar con esa orquesta en 1961. Su asociación con la Filarmónica fue seguida de labores directoriales con varias orquestas norteamericanas importantes, entre ellas las sinfónicas de Chicago, Toronto y San Francisco. Pero fue durante sus veintinueve temporadas en Boston (1973-2002) que Ozawa consolidó su reputación como un director brillante y desenvuelto que se deleitaba con el repertorio clásico y romántico, pero que también se complacía en promover estimulantes obras de compositores modernos.

When the play moved to Broadway a year later, Olmos’s electrifying performance earned him a Tony nomination and a role in the film version of the play. He became a household name in the mid- to late 1980s through his award-winning incarnation of Lieutenant Martin Castillo in the TV series Miami Vice. This was followed by an Academy Award nomination in 1988 for his down-to-earth portrayal of high school math teacher Jaime Escalante in Stand and Deliver. On the wake of the film’s success, Olmos, who is also an activist, lectured nationally on the need for educational reforms in Latino schools.   George Rodríguez’s double career as a celebrity photographer and a visual chronicler of the Chicano experience converge in this portrait of Olmos.      Edward James Olmos saltó a la fama como actor en 1978 con el papel de El Pachuco, el narrador en el musical Zoot Suit de Luis Valdez, que trataba sobre el asesinato ocurrido en Sleepy Lagoon en 1942 y los disturbios subsiguientes entre soldados euro-estadounidenses y jóvenes mexico-estadounidenses. Cuando la obra se trasladó a Broadway un año después, la actuación electrizante de Olmos le mereció la nominación al premio Tony y un papel en la versión cinematográfica de la obra. En la década de 1980, se hizo muy conocido con su premiada actuación como el teniente Martín Castillo en la serie de televisión Miami Vice. A esto siguió una nominación al Oscar en 1988 por su realista interpretación del maestro de matemáticas de escuela secundaria Jaime Escalante en la película Stand and Deliver. A raíz del éxito de la película, Olmos, quien también es activista, recorrió el país dando conferencias sobre la necesidad de reformas educativas en las escuelas con mayoría de alumnos hispanos.  La doble carrera de George Rodríguez como fotógrafo de celebridades y cronista visual de la experiencia chicana se plasma en este retrato de Olmos."

After earning an undergraduate degree in physics from Harvard, a MA in astronomy from the University of Texas, and a PhD in astrophysics from Columbia, Tyson found his professional niche—developing a worldwide following thanks to his genius for making science not merely accessible but exhilarating.   Tyson posed for this portrait in his office at the American Museum of Natural History, where he serves as director of the Hayden Planetarium.

In 2005 she published Gilead, the first of a projected quartet of novels. It won the Pulitzer Prize and established Robinson as one of the nation’s most important contemporary writers. She has distinguished herself, in particular, through her nuanced and thoughtful engagement with themes of family and Christianity.

126410,"Legendary jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald (1917–1996) was famous for such hits as “Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)” (1931), “A Tisket, a Tasket” (1938), and a recording of Porgy and Bess (1959) with Louis Armstrong. Through collaborations and innovative vocal techniques, she elevated the role of the female jazz singer and influenced musicians in numerous genres, winning fourteen Grammy Awards and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. This diptych by MacArthur “Genius Grant”–winning artist Carrie Mae Weems blurs and dilutes an iconic 1960 Herman Leonard photograph of Fitzgerald to mesmerizing effect. The crisp, contemporary photograph of a vintage microphone not only marks the historical moment but also the melancholy beauty of Fitzgerald’s voice. This work originated as part of a series called Slow Fade to Black (2010–11), composed of similarly blurred and cropped appropriated images of other African American female performers, a subject of vital importance to Weems.

128189,"Between the late 1970s and the early 2000s, hip-hop developed from a New York City urban subculture of African American and Puerto Rican youth into a powerful industry that had become the most widely listened-to music genre internationally. Fred Brathwaite, aka Fab 5 Freddy, was instrumental to this process. Coming out of the street art scene during the 1970s, which included luminaries like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring, Brathwaite derived his nickname from his association with the Fabulous 5 graffiti group that painted the sides of the city’s subways. Through graffiti exhibitions that he curated in the galleries and rock clubs of downtown Manhattan, Fab 5 Freddy helped connect street culture with the city’s art scene. In 1988 he became the host of MTV’s first foray into rap: Yo! MTV Raps.  Jane Dickson painted this portrait in 1982, the same year she co-produced the hip-hop cult movie Wild Style with Fab 5 Freddy and Charlie Ahearn. "
